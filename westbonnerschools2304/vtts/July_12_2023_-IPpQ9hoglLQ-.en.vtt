00:14:11.910 --> 00:14:11.920 align:start position:0%
think that would be a better route
 

00:14:11.920 --> 00:14:13.470 align:start position:0%
think that would be a better route
because<00:14:12.199><c> if</c><00:14:12.279><c> you</c><00:14:12.399><c> want</c><00:14:12.519><c> to</c><00:14:12.639><c> go</c><00:14:12.759><c> with</c><00:14:12.880><c> Mr</c><00:14:13.079><c> dur</c>

00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:15.670 align:start position:0%
because if you want to go with Mr dur

00:20:07.270 --> 00:20:07.280 align:start position:0%
so let me clarify one thing is that
 

00:20:07.280 --> 00:20:10.110 align:start position:0%
so let me clarify one thing is that
already<00:20:07.799><c> the</c><00:20:07.880><c> board</c><00:20:08.159><c> approved</c><00:20:08.960><c> 116,000</c><00:20:09.960><c> and</c>

00:20:10.110 --> 00:20:10.120 align:start position:0%
already the board approved 116,000 and
 

00:20:10.120 --> 00:20:12.789 align:start position:0%
already the board approved 116,000 and
that's<00:20:10.600><c> that's</c><00:20:10.960><c> actually</c><00:20:11.240><c> been</c><00:20:11.480><c> built</c><00:20:11.840><c> in</c><00:20:12.520><c> to</c>

00:20:12.789 --> 00:20:12.799 align:start position:0%
that's that's actually been built in to
 

00:20:12.799 --> 00:20:14.870 align:start position:0%
that's that's actually been built in to
the<00:20:12.960><c> budget</c><00:20:13.480><c> I</c><00:20:13.559><c> think</c><00:20:13.799><c> that's</c><00:20:14.320><c> actually</c><00:20:14.520><c> maybe</c>

00:20:14.870 --> 00:20:14.880 align:start position:0%
the budget I think that's actually maybe
 

00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:16.630 align:start position:0%
the budget I think that's actually maybe
part<00:20:15.039><c> of</c><00:20:15.200><c> salaries</c><00:20:15.600><c> and</c><00:20:15.799><c> benefits</c><00:20:16.280><c> at</c><00:20:16.440><c> this</c>

00:20:16.630 --> 00:20:16.640 align:start position:0%
part of salaries and benefits at this
 

00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:19.990 align:start position:0%
part of salaries and benefits at this
point<00:20:17.039><c> yeah</c><00:20:17.400><c> so</c><00:20:17.760><c> there</c><00:20:17.919><c> is</c><00:20:18.080><c> a</c><00:20:18.320><c> gap</c><00:20:18.679><c> of</c><00:20:19.400><c> if</c><00:20:19.799><c> if</c>

00:20:19.990 --> 00:20:20.000 align:start position:0%

00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:21.870 align:start position:0%
