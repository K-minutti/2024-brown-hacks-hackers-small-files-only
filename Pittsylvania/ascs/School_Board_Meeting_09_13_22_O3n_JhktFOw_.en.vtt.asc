good evening members of the board it is
my privilege to speak before you on
behalf of the student representatives
and the student body of chatham high
before i share with you i would like to
say that it is fitting that you ask the
cavalier to be first in line to present
as chatham has been a premier leader in
the county since its founding in 1964.
even today we are recognizing three of
my fellow ffa members and their state
achievements this past june at the
virginia ffa convention
this month i've been tasked with
presenting you all trustworthiness
as you all know having a strong bond of
trust with those in your life whether
the relationships be work or personal is
a key to success
i found a quote that i thought put into
words exactly how much we should value
this trust
it reads
trust is the glue of life
it is the most essential ingredient
in effective communication
it's the foundational principle that
holds all relationships
stephen covey
as we leave this room let us all
remember to work towards trusting others
as well as work towards gaining the
trust of those around us
thank you and i look forward to working
with all of you in the coming
year thank you miss scare
up next is pennsylvanians for a brighter
future
hello dr walker
i see you have a team with you tonight
we do mr chairman it's a pleasure to be
here i'm martha walker from the dan
river district and i bring greetings to
all the board members superintendent
jones and all of our administrators and
our students this is the best night of
all to be here because of all the
wonderful achievements of our students
that's why we do what we do
that's why we go out that's why we talk
to people about things
that are important to this county
and as you know what's important to this
county at this moment
along with everything else you're
working on
is a one percent sales tax referendum
that is on the november 8 ballot
we have been asking for support since
that was placed on the ballot in
november we know it will raise 3.8
million dollars at a minimum we even
looked at what some of the numbers were
from this last week's uh
vrr
concert and based on projections from
last year last year taxes
sales tax increased by 28
when you had that many tourists in the
community that says a lot about
potential of why sales tax is an
equitable tax and important
most importantly we know what it's
invested in pennsylvania county has done
its due diligence we know that our
schools our elementary schools are going
to be impacted in a positive way
but most importantly as well we know
that twelve million dollars is being
designated for our career and technical
programs tonight with us we have people
that you already know and that you have
heard from i want to introduce miss
angela rigney who needs no introduction
to this group or to those listening
online so ms rigney will you come and
then followed by our principal miss
jessica
dalton
thank you good evening chairman dahl
school board members dr jones and
pennsylvania county citizens
of course as you all know my name is
angela ritney and i'm the director of
career and technical and adult education
for the division and also a parent of a
student at chatham high school and the
stem academy
pennsylvania county schools has been a
key partner in developing and
implementing various initiatives that
greatly benefit the region the
pennsylvania career and technical center
has been very instrumental in laying a
firm foundation in the economic growth
and transformation of the region through
partnerships and collaboration the
students in pennsylvania county have an
opportunity to train on high-tech
equipment earn college credits and gain
the knowledge and skills necessary to be
prepared for careers in high wage high
demand
industries
this collaborative team is working
together to create a regional training
facilities expand capacity and feed our
programs and increase awareness of
career opportunities in the fields of
agriculture automotive i.t precision
machining welding automation and
robotics engineering hospitality and
tourism public services hvac industrial
maintenance electricity education and
health and medical sciences
these initiatives that have been a part
of at elementary schools middle schools
high schools the stem academy and the
have primarily been funded by grants and
other funding sources totaling
approximately eight million dollars
thus in order for us to move this region
in the right direction pennsylvania
county citizens need to invest in our
children's future to provide them with
safe and innovative learning
environments that prepares them for
careers of the future the career and
technical education programs at the
and other programs need to be renovated
and facilities expanded in order for us
to meet the needs of the region i
challenge each citizen to answer this
question
do you go to the doctor
have an automobile
have a home
wear clothes have a phone
have heat and air conditioning
eat and the list could go on if you
answered yes to any of these then you
should invest in our students because we
are training them to be the next doctors
mechanics machinists nurses
cosmetologists welders
hvac technicians police officers first
responders teachers
cooks and again the list could go on
the success and recognition our programs
are receiving across the country and
internationally should make every
citizen in this region proud and want to
invest in the capital improvements of
the facilities i extend an invitation
for anyone to visit the crew and
technical center and let us show you
first hand what many identify as the
best kept secret in pennsylvania county
i hope the stories and message we share
this evening will encourage you to vote
yes for pcs this november at this time i
invite miss jessica dalton to the podium
jones thank you for the opportunity to
speak with you this evening regarding
the one percent sales tax and the
benefit to the pennsylvania current
technical center
as the principal at pctc my job is to
oversee and manage the operations of the
building
with that we've had experience of issues
with major leaks within our building
that have damaged equipment and quite
honestly cannot be replaced due to the
expense
as many know millions of dollars of
grant funds have been invested into the
state-of-the-art equipment to streamline
training purposes in our programs
having a building that's outdated with
new heavy equipment puts us at risk when
we face issues such as having enough
electricity to run
our automation robotics program our
welding lab our precision machining lab
and our new i.t academy
in addition unlike other schools we do
not have a common meeting area for
competition meetings classroom meetings
etc this has caused a burden when
hosting skillsusa competitions
we at times have to find different
location sites to conduct these meetings
you heard from our cte director ms
rigney and the need and impact for
economic development in our region
we are integral part of supporting this
local regional industry and business
need
if we look five to seven to ten years
down the road we need to evaluate the
programs and new programs our region may
need for workforce development
at this time pctc is at capacity
ms rigney and myself are now currently
hearing the needs of our partners and at
this time cannot meet their needs due to
the fact that we cannot bring another
program in our building
now currently some of our labs hold a
classroom and this also creates spacing
and sometimes safety concerns due the
fact that we are essentially out of
space and out of room
many of our programs require
accreditations and with this we must
meet those needs to keep the programs
open and current
again this is a good problem to have
because it shows growth and improvement
in our numbers and our programs however
we need to think about our future
and where we will be if we do not have
space to grow
this one percent sales tax will provide
the opportunity for growth in our
community and our region and support
those needs
this evening you will have the
opportunity to hear from pctc alumni as
well as a current student regarding
their perspectives and testimonies about
this 1 sales tax i invite them to come
forward
good afternoon my name is leighton
wilson during my junior and senior year
of high school i attended pennsylvania
county
technical career center
and was a student in the precision
machining technology program
during my time there i found my passion
in my future career
and machining and so many others found
their passion in other programs
pctc has changed me into a brighter and
more self-efficient person where no one
else could
i had the honor to be in a club called
skillsusa
and compete in the cnc milling
specialist category
i succeeded in becoming a district
champion state champion
and traveling to atlanta georgia to
place sixth nationally
i even had the opportunity to speak with
go tech students at the middle school
explaining my role at pctc and encourage
them to work up
to becoming a student there
today there is a huge disadvantage when
it comes to students getting the
education that they desire to have
no one should have to pay the amount of
money for college just to achieve a
career job
that is exactly what pctc helps with
students come out with certifications
ready to be hired without the push for
college yes i agree that every student
should go to college but some people
aren't as
fortunate as others
this technical center offers a once in a
lifetime opportunity for students to get
ahead get ahead of their future
even though pctc has so many benefits is
an outstanding place to learn the
facility has some problems
when i was in the precision machining
program everything had to be perfect
precise and without room for error but
we were faced with problems in the shop
we had a water leak that caused rust on
a milling table and the machine was out
of commission for a while
our cnc milling
machine has a major air leak and we're
not able to use it the entire time i was
there in the years before
we also have had other
leaks that has caused problems in the
shop limiting our production process
these obstacles have put this program
behind on the education that it
potentially offers i can only speak for
the program that i was most familiar
with but i am certain that the same
things are happening with every program
the condition of this facility affects
the education students can potentially
have by limiting what they can learn
this one percent sales tax will benefit
pctc in
extravagant ways with that money we
could add up to 15 more programs extend
the building and bring more and more
students to give them the same
experience i once had miss rigney works
to secure grants for textbooks equipment
and tools
that money cannot be used toward capital
improvements localities
need to invest in capital improvements
for their children our future workforce
is depending on our education system
and a technical center that can make our
students a part of the pipeline that is
already in place
one last question i want to leave for
you all to answer is would you want your
children and grandchildren to go to a
school like this to get a grasp for
their future career
thank you for your time and i hope my
words can influence you to vote yes
good afternoon my name is caleb wells
during my junior and senior years of
high school i attended pctc and took
precision machining
during my time there i fell in love with
machining and all things about it
pctc has made me a better person and has
made my life a lot better from the
friends that i can call family who i met
there in my senior year i was able to
compete in skillsusa and the cnc turning
i loved and appreciated the opportunity
so much i was able to become a district
and state champion and play sixth in the
national finals in atlanta georgia in
june
anyways today there is a big dry area
when it comes to students getting the
education they deserve in high school
in my opinion no student should have to
pay to go to school to learn to trade
and that is what pctc is helpful for
students can graduate with a
certification
in many forms of trades and go straight
into the workforce
i do believe that you should go to
college to further advance your
knowledge
and a trade as well but some people do
not have the ability to pay for college
that's where pctc comes into play
helping students who are more
unfortunate than others
even though pctc is a great place to get
a head start in life
it still has some problems
even in my precision machining course i
could spot out the problems we would
have water and air leaks it seems like
every day and granted yes they would get
fixed because the staff
is always on top of their game it seems
like something new with our eyes every
day
the air and water leaks would slow down
our production and make it difficult to
get projects out
we didn't even get to use our cnc
milling machine because of the major air
leaks and the machine being so outdated
that it still uses a floppy disk
these things have caused the program to
take a slight decline from what it was
before these issues started arising
i know i'm only speaking for the one
program
but it is the one that i would call
school for half of the day five days a
week for two years
pctc in ways that would not even be
thought of before
with the money pctc could receive they
could expand the building creating up to
15 new programs and bringing in more
students with great minds
who want to help build our country by
working in the trades
our future depends on these trades and
pctc is the start of something special
in many people's lives
it is a great opportunity for your
children and grandchildren to get a head
start in their lives and do something
productive
i am encouraging all young people people
who care about the future of america and
people who support the trades to vote
yes to build a stronger workforce and to
keep america
and our area great
thank you for your time
my name is tony myers and i'm a senior
at gretna high school in pctc pull the
bike down just a little bit
there you go last year i took
electricity and now i have returned to
pctc as a senior taking the industrial
maintenance program my pro my parents
and i know and respect the fact that i
want to learn hands-on skills to be
effective in my work environment my
father works construction and i
currently work with my father and find
my hands-on training very important i've
truly enjoyed my classes at pctc hence
the reason i chose to came back my
senior year this past summer i had the
opportunity to compete at national usa
national skills usa in atlanta georgia
and gain the wealth and knowledge and
relationships i would carry into my
future bctc and the staff have helped me
help mold me mold me into who i am today
however
as a member of this community and
student in the school i am concerned
regarding the future and the need to
update and create rooms for additional
programs like i said my father was
construction and i would love to see
building trades be brought into pctc
along with others however they have no
space currently in addition the locker
rooms are outdated and need to be redone
i hope to remain in this area and
realize without a community
understanding and investing in programs
in our schools we may not be able to fix
the current problems we have and may not
be able to bring new programs to pctc i
ask that everyone vote for the one cent
sales tax and invest in our students
programs in future
school members dr jones assistant
superintendents and guests my name is
blake hughes i'm a 2022 graduate of dan
river high school my junior and senior
years were spent as a persistent
machining student at the pennsylvania
career and technical center better known
as pctc
i'm here this evening to talk about how
the one percent sales tax can benefit
the schools in pennsylvania county
especially pctc
the pennsylvania career and technical
center was built in
1978 and not many renovations have been
done there in the past 44 years the
one-cent sales tax increase will fund
the construction and renovations for
several of the 20 programs offered
just in the machine shop online there
are multiple repairs and renovations
needed other programs can be extended
and some even relocated
all of the programs would benefit from
the sales tax increase and entice more
students to attend pctc as well
while paying one cent sales tax increase
seems terrible to some people it is
actually an investment for the future of
pennsylvania county
it is well worth it to enhance the
educational needs in our area so that
students can participate in hands-on
training programs in a safe equipped
building that allows them to prepare for
their future as well as ours
so i asked everyone here this evening
that please vote yes on november 8th so
fisa vande county can oppose a one-cent
sales tax for the construction and
renovation of our schools thus way
pittsburgh county schools can continue
to be a great place to learn and work
so i'm going to ask y'all what's more
important than educating our students
i don't think anything yes no you
already missed ready come on
i was just waiting for you um
but i think if you haven't had a chance
to look and see what the one percent
sales tax is going to be used for
please take the time to educate yourself
yes it's a tax and that's a bad word and
everybody says i'm not voting for a tax
but please educate yourself on how this
will work and why it's important and
what the funds are going to be spent for
and what we need to improve our safety
in our buildings and that's all it can
be spent for is to improve our buildings
and you know like ms walker said a few
minutes ago
look how much would have been paid from
outside of the county
this past weekend
that would have paid that bill
that would not have come out of our
pockets
so i
really please educate yourself on what
this one percent means before you just
jump up and say i don't want to pay
another tax because it's very very
important and for those who own land and
cars and things that you already have
personal property taxes on homes
just think about if this doesn't pass
and the burden falls back on just those
select few people
that own property in pennsylvania county
now because some of this work is going
to have to take place eventually whether
it's there in a few years
so please educate yourself on what this
does ms rigney
thank you i do want to take this
opportunity to thank our students for
coming back this evening they are all
enrolled in programs at the community
college and do have very busy schedules
and work and these are just four
examples of phenomenal students that we
have who are invested in the future of
our programs these students are willing
to come back and give back to
pennsylvania county schools because of
what they got from pennsylvania county
schools so i challenged you to ask all
of the students enrolled in programs at
center as well as the elementary schools
and other programs that are on the
docket that would be impacted by these
renovations and these capital
improvement projects we thank you for
your time
board dr jones anyone have any questions
for our team this evening
any more members
thank you ms reagan dr walker thank you
so much
next on the list is the pea
the other dr jones as i like to call her
so we're a month into school almost six
weeks into school right
so you're gonna give us all the good
news right well you know what
um
that's all i want tonight's good news
just well you know what i have been led
by by the conversations i've heard
and forgive my manners and my upbringing
to you all and i want to say thank you
for your investment in us and education
there are many things that you could be
doing and you chose this vocation
and sometimes i think that the task is
just not
said thankful enough
so i'm saying to you thank you because
yes mr dawes we have completed almost a
full six weeks of school
and when you say you want to hear the
positive
i will give you positive but i'll be
also honest
a lot of people are searching for peace
uh and the hastiness of life and all the
things that we've seen
happen in our society
they're occurring around us
often peace seems like it's an elusive
creature
and that is to everybody that's in this
room and those who are watching online
and the reality of it is when we're
looking at education we're often worried
about what happens to our future
do we have enough individuals coming
into the profession to continue on and
what does that look like
not just for today
but for the next decade the next
generation of individuals
who chosen to lead
and want to do good in their communities
but again
it's peace
peace and decision making peace and
knowing that you've made the right
choice
so i know this past school year
i started and ended my address with a
prayer
and i stand here tonight telling you i'm
compelled to do the same thing again
so on this day
and all the days ahead for each and
every one of us
men to quarrel
search out a forgotten friend
dismiss suspicion and replace it with
trust
forever character word of the month
write a love letter
share some treasures
give a soft answer
encourage youth
manifest your loyalty in a word or deed
keep a promise
find
the time
forgo a grudge
forgive an enemy
listen
apologize if you were wrong
try to understand
flout envy
examine your demands on others
think first of someone else
appreciate
be kind
be gentle laugh a little more
deserve confidence
take up arms against malice
decry complacency
express your gratitude and worship your
god whoever that might be
gladden the heart of a child
take pleasure in the beauty and wonder
of the earth
speak your love
speak it again
still speak it once more
and speak it even more
and never cease
to speak the truth
because the truth is what sets you free
so as we look for peace all of us and
all that we do
i thank you again for choosing this as
your vocation
because you're needed
for today and for the future
thank you dr john

selected to participate in the virginia
department of education bridging the gap
learning loss recovery plan initiative
this is a pilot program that will
spotlight some of the great programs
intervention strategies and successes
that school divisions across virginia
are implementing now
while supporting more innovative
applications of data-driven instruction
and increasing the capacity of every
school to strengthen their relationships
with parents and student caregivers
over the coming weeks our instructional
staff will participate in meetings with
the virginia department of education
staff that will outline this program
and that will be provided to the board
at some future meetings
um also this evening there was a desk
report uh provided by mrs dawson and mrs
petty that had our s1l scores and i
would like to again draw your attention
to that
because we've done some analysis of our
scores you know while the last two years
have been
difficult at best
we feel very good about where our
students are at this time while they're
not where they we think they would have
been had we been in school
when we compare our scores across the
state i'd like to bring this back up i
think i've shared this with you before
but we are
17th
best
in the state out of 132 school divisions
in reading and math which is the top 13
percent
and we are 20th best in science as far
as uh
pass rates
in science and that's the top 15
so it really says a lot about what our
staff does with our students says a lot
about our households and families and
the concerns they have for education and
it speaks volumes about pennsylvania
county schools so i'd like to thank mrs
petty and her staff thank mrs dawson for
the data this evening and again express
of how proud we are of our students
