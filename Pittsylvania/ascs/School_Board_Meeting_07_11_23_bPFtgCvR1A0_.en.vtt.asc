okay no one finished beat this will move
on to new business the 2022
2023 budget summary a request for
carryover for the
22-23 school year it was a pretty large
carryover Miss warley but a lot going on
right yes sir good evening chairman Dahl
school board members and staff I want to
give you just a brief summary of fiscal
year 2023 and and how that went we
managed a
128.6 million dollar budget this past
year and that's all funding State local
and federal and of course cares money
was in there as well I wanted to just
hit a few highlights of what we were
able to do this past year we provided an
average seven percent salary increase to
contract employees we provided bonuses
to employees in November of 2022 one
thousand dollar full-time 500 part-time
we increase the employer share for
health insurance and we also started
making an annual deposit into employees
health savings accounts
we've juggled several on large
construction projects we have two HVAC
projects going on multiple Roofing
projects and of course
um just general maintenance on all of
our facilities we purchased two electric
buses and we are we'll be adding as soon
as they come in I believe
this month I hope another 11 buses to
our Fleet and we purchased two
additional electric buses
um we continue to use our federal
pandemic funds to hire additional staff
provide additional technology to our
classrooms including implementing a
one-to-one device initiative I mean
we've also worked with the county on
broadband and some other construction
projects
and all this all that time we were also
managing a staff of approximately 1500
employees maintaining instructional
programs for over 7 500 students and
meeting all of our financial obligations
for the year
and if it was as nice and neat and quick
as that little paragraph Was
um I missed that part so it sounds
really easy and simple there doesn't it
um we do have a 9.5 million dollar
carryover that is large
um I have already alerted the county
I've been doing that for the past two
months and you can see here I'm not
going to go over all the items there are
a lot of Grant funds that we already
have received and for certain programs
so they're they're being carried over
most of those are the same from year to
year
um you do see we are carrying over 1.4
million dollars for the Stony Mill HVAC
project you'll be um talking about that
later I think
we have some replacement Vehicles you
see we have some FY 22 carryovers we
carried it over last year we've still
not been able to order these vehicles so
we're carrying this money over again in
hopes that we'll be able to make those
purchases
um we're carrying over money for school
buses that is um
because the buses were supposed to be
here several different times we thought
they were coming in June
um and we had the opportunity to
purchase two additional buses besides
the ones that are on our lease from last
year they had ordered a couple of extra
in case our electric buses didn't come
through and because we were able to
provide funding for that we went ahead
and and purchased those as well
textbooks as always we have a very large
carryover for that you can see the high
school band Towers here the armored one
entry window film
the maintenance Warehouse we we have
some things ordered but we're still
working to try to get that completed
um and the ongoing maintenance projects
you can see they are our general year
end painting different flooring
um we have ordered the ice storage
tiller for Gretna High School the HVAC
Chiller and Air Handlers for Stony Mill
have already been ordered but these
things they have not come in and we have
not paid those invoices yet and then for
vocational and I.T same thing they are
these were some things they had ordered
towards the end of the year and we need
to to pay those invoices when they come
in
so what I will need from you on this is
to approve this carryover for us to
submit to the Board of Supervisors and
we will ask them um to of course to
appropriate that to our budget for next
year any questions
any questions from MS warley
I have a motion to approve it
you make it here okay
any other discussion
roll call please Mr Burton yes Mr
Merricks yes Mr Mills yes Mr Moon Mr
Doss yes and categorical categorical
adjustments additions Appropriations and
get some more you need to move I do yes
so um the next item on your agenda this
is um
sort of settling up the year end we have
to get our categories correct um because
the Board of Supervisors they do approve
our expenditures by category and we also
have to have some additional
Appropriations for this past school year
for the general fund as well as the
school nutrition fund the the general
operating fund we need an amendment of
5.9 million dollars approximately and
you can see in board docs you can see
that information and it's basically
additional revenues that we received
this past school year outside of our
budget that we approved
the cafeteria fund the school nutrition
fund that's the the sort of the same
type of thing I did want to make one
clarification for you they did take in
um more federal and state revenues than
the budget that we adopted but they also
had to spend some of their fund balance
this past year and so that was not in
the operating budget for school
nutrition that all totals to about 1.2
million dollars and I want to tell you
why they had to spend some fund balance
Federal Regulations state that school
nutrition programs can only carry a cash
balance that equals about three months
of an average operating expenditures
when you exceed that you get a nice
little phone call from bdoe and they
talk to you about putting together a
plan to spend some of that money so
that's where we are and we have spent we
spent about a little over five hundred
thousand dollars this past year on some
things that were needed for the school
nutrition program and at June 30 we had
brought that down we're about four
months we have about four months worth
of operating expenditures and I think we
can probably sit on that for a little
while because you know operations will
obviously be more um next school year
but we are working with on the state to
spend that down
so what I need from you tonight is just
to approve um
the additional the amendment to the
budget to go to the Board of Supervisors
for an additional appropriation and then
of course the um categorical year-end
transfers
any questions on any of that
questions I have a motion in a second to
approve it
exactly Motion in the second broke on
