good evening
i would like to thank all the students
parents and staff for joining us tonight
for the pcs pctc signing event
this has been a very successful year for
pennsylvania county schools as well as
the pennsylvania career technical center
we would like to take this opportunity
to not only highlight our students and
their accomplishments but also the
instructors who put a lot of time and
effort into their programs thank you
skillsusa has partnered with the
pennsylvania current technical center to
acknowledge honor and celebrate high
school seniors who have chosen to pursue
careers in skilled trades and higher
education
national signing day 2022 is an
opportunity to recognize thousands of
high school seniors nationwide who are
committing to careers or continuing
their education
in addition to publicly acknowledging
these students national signing day will
be an opportunity to educate our local
community employers and businesses about
the skills gap and the benefits of
encouraging students to pursue careers
i would like to take this opportunity to
recognize distinguished guests
dr mark jones our division
superintendent
miss joyce price state director for
skillsusa
dean terry and kathy pulliam from
danville community college
miss angela rigney ct director for
pennsylvania county schools
ms sarah hodges average university
mr bill dunn business agent and
assistant apprenticeship coordinator for
local 10
and juan gonzalez mid-atlantic pipe
trading recruiter thank you for being
with us tonight
at this time i asked dr jones division
superintendent to come forward and make
a few remarks
good
evening
this is an exciting night
for you
i know that
my boys are much older than your
children are
but
they went through high school they went
on to college and did some things but
when they got their first job
that's when i was most pleased
you know when they can make their own
money and you know that there's not that
revolving door that comes back and opens
up every time you turn around that's a
good feeling for parents so this is an
exciting time for you all this evening
i'm sure
this is an exciting time for us as well
as a division
we
want to do what's best for the students
and we feel that what's best is first to
set that foundation of skills that they
need
i mean most of that has been set by you
all
to get to work on time
not take long breaks
that's what they learn from you
and then we
are we benefit from that and we're
seeing that this evening because these
students come to us with those set of
foundational skills or values that are
instilled in them from families
we also have sitting in the back on the
back row and that's where i'd be seated
if i were an instructor but sitting on
the back row are the individuals who who
we feel very
proud of we're very proud of this group
and what they provide to our students
we feel like that when they leave
these classes they are ready
they're ready to either go on to dcc
danville community college or step out
into the workforce and to step out into
jobs that that will set them up nicely
for
down the road when they start having
families you know they're secure
in their futures and so that's what
we're about we're also very pleased to
have partnerships with the businesses
and we appreciate that collaboration
we know that
that really we serve them
i mean we need their input on what
what our product is and that's our
students and and your children you know
when they enter the workforce what they
see are deficits or what they see our
strengths when our students leave us and
go to them so this is quite an
opportunity for us to really get
feedback from our businesses to ensure
that we're doing what we need to do for
our children our students
and that we put courses in place that
create these opportunities where our
children leave us and they can make
a good money and that's kind of simple
terms but that's what i'm sure you want
for your children to be very successful
i end my comments this evening first for
thanking you all
uh parents for sharing your children
with us for 13 years
i thank our staff for the excellent work
that they do each and every day in
preparing the students and i thank our
students for the hard work that they
have displayed over the last 13 years
that has prepared them to enter the
workforce and most importantly i think
