we're got to do January's character word
of the month Mr Hernandez chadam High
School
good
evening I invite you to reflect on a
quote by wartime British prime minister
Winston Churchill in which he says that
the price of greatness is responsibility
this highlights the idea that when we
have the ability to achieve great things
we also bear the responsibility to use
that power wisely in our schools this
tenant fares no differently whether
student or staff each one of us plays a
vital role in shaping the educational
environment the decisions we make both
big and small have a ripple effect on
the entire Community inside and outside
the school building but responsibility
is more than just checking off tasks on
a to-do list it's about making choices
aligned with our values and commitments
it's about doing the right thing even
when it may not yield such a smooth path
as we navigate the challenges of our
educational roles we ought to remember
that our responsible choices contribute
to a positive and nurturing learning
environment so as we continue the second
semester of this school year I invite
you to make a conscious effort every day
to be the most responsible you can be
and to follow the ideas of the late
prime minister if everyone does their
part Pennsylvania County Schools is
guaranteed to be a great place to learn
and work thank you thank
you and a February character word of the
month M ma d r
High good evening school board members
Dr Jones and guests in the audience I
have been given the opportunity to speak
on February's character word of the
month self-control a little kingdom I
possess where thoughts and feelings
dwell and very hard the task I find of
governing it well Louisa May Alcott this
quote describes the Mind perfectly she
talks about having a little kingdom
where feelings and thoughts dwell
mentioning having a having the difficult
task of governing it well this shows the
Battle of self-control having governance
over your thoughts feelings and actions
but having diffic a difficult time doing
so self-control is the act of operating
yourself in the correct way not speaking
out of turn and holding yourself
accountable for your actions
self-control takes discipline the
ability to filter your words and
thoughts and take to take appropriate
action when you become upset
self-control is something that people
lack they simply do not find use for it
believing that it is okay to act and say
whatever they want without consequences
they lack self-control and therefore the
discipline to work pay attention to
instruction and govern themselves
correctly thank you thank you Miss
Maz appreciate that M pett you have some
recognitions you need to

re if you don't know what they do at
pctc stop by sometime you'll be amazed
at the stuff that's in that building
with those students do I try to get by
there once or twice a year and it's just
it's amazing what those teachers and all
do over
there next we have a request to address
the board Miss Bagley you
they were telling me be sure to talk
loud enough so I hope you can hear me
there you go members of the school board
and Dr Jones and the staff uh I have
come because I've been on a journey
lately about school I wrote this little
book and we're giving each one of y'all
and the staff one and U it's called
school days my memories of Stonewall
Jackson School of Danville Virginia 1960
to
1966 the phone rang this
afternoon and it was a student that went
there uh ahead of me and she was
remembering days of Mayday and good food
and sweet teachers and and sometimes uh
the boys getting caught with the
spitballs and and having to stand in the
corner or
whatever and she was remembering how
much fun it was for the field trips and
memorizing the multiplication tables and
taking home your report
cards and she said to me it was the
making of my
life and I appreciated that so much that
lady grew up and became a teacher at
this Stonewall Jackson School there at
the corner of Bradley Road in
Danville I've come to share it with you
just because I wanted to remind us all
of what a good um school and what our
goal is and and how we are to to educate
the Next
Generation and and to remind you that
you're doing a good
job and that we need to do even more and
I'm excited about it I was only eight
years old in
1962 so you're doing the math now
birthday coming up the big one uh in
1962 that meline muo hair came and she
um was kind of the poster child to take
the Bible out of the public
schools I really didn't hear anything
about it uh life went right on just like
it always had at Stonewall it was fun we
walked to school a mile and a mile home
and we were in the band and you know it
just life was regular no no teacher said
that they were scared of what the
government was going to do or what
changes had to be
made and that takes y'all back to 1962
also what happened then you know I think
most people didn't believe that the um
the Constitution was going to be changed
at all um they it says Congress shall
make no law respecting an establishment
of religion or prohibiting the free
exercise
thereof or Bridging the freedom of
speech or of the press or the right of
the people peaceably to assemble and to
petition the government for a redress of
grievances I don't think the adults in
the
world could imagine anything
different but things started
changing and in some school systems in
this country began to take away the
blessing for the lunch and and uh the
devotions after the pledge of allegiance
to the flag and the morning and and the
Bible teachers that came every month or
so uh they took away the recitations
that you might have in the assemblies
and and God was removed from many
schools I know at
Stonewall and in
Danville nothing
changed we went right
on and that remained a good time and I
couldn't help but think in the months
that I've been thinking about this
little
book that there was some people with
courage in
Danville and uh they just stood up for
what they knew was in the
Constitution it's a balance thing
between the left side of the phrase and
the right side of the
phrase Congress should make no law
respecting an establishment of religion
that's on one side the other side of the
phrase is or prohibiting the free
thereof both are true both are
important and yet these things started
changing and even valedictorians could
not mention God in their speeches and I
couldn't quite figure out how she could
have or he could have freedom of
speech and not be able to say what she
or he wanted to say
sometimes there were
um people that could not bring a Bible
on the
campus there are some schools I mean I
don't know I might be speaking to one
right now I don't know but I love
Pennsylvania county and my career has
been here to develop and run seaw
retreat center and to live here and I'm
a resident here and uh I I want very
much for God to bless this County and um
you
know we had to to make some
choices but as a child I didn't realize
what choices they
were I realized in writing this that
superintendent OT boner must have been a
brave man and he must have backed up
those principles and teachers because
they were free to choose or not to
choose to share something from the
scripture I know that it went past
Stonewall in junior high school we had
to memorize the Prayer of St Francis of
aisi Lord make me an instrument of thy
peace and so forth to get into the
Junior Honor Society and we sang lead on
O King Eternal at the graduation of the
eth grade nobody
complained I know at George Washington
High School principal JT Christopher got
on the intercom every morning in Home
Room
and he read a Devotion to us this is
1969 S years after meline Murray
O'Hare and he prayed for
us at GW we started our day with his
prayers things changed when he retired
the next year Personnel in anything
families businesses whatever changes a
lot of
things but you know what we never forgot
what the schools stood up to
do and I am so thankful because you know
what in the Bible there's things that we
need in science and that ruling from the
Supreme Court said that teachers could
not lead in prayer and they could not
make the children um memorize
scripture but it had gone so far past
all that so far past it and sometimes
we've missed some scientific and
historic things two things scientific
and historic principles that the Bible
has that are riches that we need
desperately that we need Columbus knew
that the world was round because of
Isaiah
40:22 he God who sits above the circle
of the
earth is the one who judges
us
and then
suppose suppose a teacher of Columbus
from Greta one of ours had had taught
him that we wouldn't still be on the
wrong side of the pond 452 years later
I'm really thankful that somebody opened
the word of God to him and then the the
physicians in the mid 1800s there was a
doctor I know that was wondering why the
the mothers that delivered the babies
why are they dying in the over in the
Midwife wing of the hospital they're
they're
living and they didn't know about germs
the Bible
did and Leviticus
5:13 it talks about cleansing the body
after disease or wounds with running
water and before that the doctors were
using the same dirty Basin of used water
to tend to the new
mothers suppose that a teacher from
hurt had taught the student who learned
that germs will and taking care of those
germs would save thousands of women
suppose we did that and Albert Einstein
that that man had have to get you to
kind of hurry up get to the end please
that man had a disappointment because he
uh he had failed to to real realized
that the Earth was was uh was trans was
not Transcendent it was expanding
universe and and he had to kind of eat
crow because he didn't realize it and
yet right there in the scripture it's
talking about the Lord stretches forth
the heavens and laid the foundations of
the earth Isaiah
425 what a great scientist Marone and
Tesla they made the radio but they were
studying the electromagnetic waves and
he fought over who really got the
patent but just think how the radio
television computer has changed our
lives a student from this County could
have done
that you
know we need very much the truths that
are in the
scriptures and the supreme court allows
the study of the word of God but not
devotionally or
evangelistically but oh to be able to
Simply make those references and say
this is what it says for the
truth I would like to offer to have
dinners paid
for for Christian Educators to come and
eat dinner hear a good speaker and then
to uh receive material that they would
be able to use references that are from
the scripture but I'd like your blessing
and I'd like for you to back up your
principles and teachers because they
need to be
free people have died to give us that
freedom and I know that Pennsylvania
county has the greatest days ahead and I
want to thank all of you for serving
this County and God bless Pennsylvania
county in the United States of America
thank you thank
you hope you enjoyed the
book Thank You
Ma'am next we have recognition of a

Mr Calvin D
dos Mr Mark
Shields Mr Kevin
MS MR Don Moon
too
long this
Kelly Mr Willie
Fitzgerald okay now we at the paa I
always say the other Dr
Jones good evening it's hard to believe
we've gotten to February already a't
it before long it'll be
graduation what is it less than 70 days
something yeah it's not it's not far I
know right not far AR we all excited for
warmer
weather yep I know right and that
groundhog told a
lie don't believe Punks on Phil he he
does not speak truth but uh I'll go
ahead and move on with the presentation
you all say good evening to you and I
hope that you are enjoying your February
uh though it seems like we had winter a
week ago and we had spring yesterday I
anticipate summer will be here next week
so uh I'll keep moving along very
quickly just like the seasons seems to
be changing on us as quickly as they are
within seven days uh with that being
said at the January school board meeting
when we held it across the street I
shared a few items with y'all and
talking about re benchmarking jlar the
general assembly bills and all the
different things that are going on in
public
education and how it's just a roller
coaster Rod uh and it doesn't seem to be
stopping at this point so yesterday we
had our Abel meeting in Richmond and I
uh addressed yall about two proposals
that we had to the Board of Education
about the Virginia communication and
literacy assessment um which continues
to be a barrier to those that are
seeking initial lure and it's a huge
issue when you can't get teachers into
the pipeline uh when we're also faced
with teachers leaving out and then
there's a lot of vacancies um with that
being said yesterday we did approve
proposal number one which uh is a
recommendation to eliminate the Virginia
communication literacy assessment for
individuals seeking a professional
license in the endorsement areas of
early primary education prek-3
Elementary education prek 6 special
education General curriculum K12 special
education blindness and visual
impairments prek 12 and special
education def heart of hearing
prek-12 now the second proposal we
actually tabled that to do more research
on that matter uh including tracking
there are two different bills that are
out one is from De uh delegate Su and
that's House Bill 731 the other one is
from delegate Josh Thomas and that's
house bill um 284 one seeking to
eliminate vcla alog together the other
one seeking to provide endorsements to
the local superintendent uh to basically
give the way you're right so right now
we're looking at these bills either
converging or diverting or dying all
together but again the whole goal is to
ensure that we can have a continuous
pipeline of Educators with barriers that
are out of the way to ensure that all
schools are fully staffed so it's not a
burden upon you or your staff um when
you don't have the children with the
Educators that they need at the front of
classroom additionally we actually heard
from Dr Brian Jackson who is the vdoe
director of lure reporting about I teach
and hopefully we'll hear something
tonight yay okay so group one which
included 16 School divisions uh some of
them neighboring us like Danville city
and Campbell County uh were approved for
their program uh further group two
included 13 School divisions and they
were under a review category and that
has since changed and I'll leave it at
that for right now and then since
February 5th when that group two had
changed status there have been two
additional School divisions that have
actually submitted applications for the
it te program uh you hear mixed reviews
about it te some will tell you it's the
greatest thing ever some will tell you
that they have not had very good
experiences particularly those out of
state U nonetheless it's the goal to
make sure again that there are licensed
Educators who are going to be at the
front of the classroom working with our
children to give them the best high
quality public education that we
consistently here coming from the
general assembly and from our leadership
at the uh level enrichment now
conversely School divisions can still
participate in the vdoe grow your own
which is a registered teacher
apprenticeship program there are 28
School divisions that have actually
received grants from the vdoe the six
recently awarded um had their cost per
Apprentice per semester between $4,000
and $55,000 which is huge uh and in
superintendent region six we only have
one School Division that's currently
participating and that's actually Rono
city um bear in mind that the
participating educator preparation
programs is actually one of our
neighbors a
university um nonetheless uh there's
additional U higher education
institutions including enry and Henry
James Madison University Virginia State
University but these institutions during
their pilot program were able to provide
tuition discounts between 25 and this is
not a typo and
72% that's huge huge savings because
when you start looking at how much it
costs to become a teacher it's not a
free job and it's not free to be able to
get there in the long run so anything
that can be done to ensure that cost are
deferred to help again continue that
pipeline is awesome so shaa leblond who
is actually a director of apprenticeship
for vdoe will be attending H uh monthly
human resource meetings around the
Commonwealth and then um she is also
going to be continuing to partner with
the national Center for grow your own so
it's an opportunity to jump on board and
and help region 6 kind of move in that
direction but they're also expanding
their register apprenticeship
occupations and this is something that I
know that Mr Burton was very passionate
about on the school board but they're
looking to do apprenticeship program for
principles uh because that too is a high
need area of individuals who are willing
to lead schools uh in that within their
communities needless to say more to come
and I could continue to go on but I'm
not I will say to you I wish you a happy
Valentine's Day and again don't listen
to punksy Tony Phil he tells
lies thank you Dr
Jones

of the freedom of choice ceremonies that
were held on February the 3rd at Greta

went extremely well and the Stu the
students on both sides were well
accepted and it like it gron High School
in tun high school and that's a really a
great thing Mr fiter was also there from
his school board um and all but I think

attended U at both both sites that day
um and then on uh Dr Joe I just want to
thank the board for working with that

the school board for doing this with the
committee I'd like to put a little input

input from you between now and the March
meeting on your thoughts regarding
Middle School sports and the facilities
uh we'd like to have a decision in March
as to the sports that we'd like to offer
for next school year uh we have met with
our High School principls athletic
directors Mr Scott chaired that meeting
today regarding uh their thoughts on
that we've met with Middle School
principles as well and level directors
on this since our last meeting with the

for you all in March to get an idea of
of what you all want to see us do for

on that I think M mer did you tell me
Dan Reva joined the junior pedmont was
that correct yes is is there a time
limit to see if the other three middle
schools need to would like to
participate in that I see the Middle
School athletic director sitting out
there he making do you know a time limit
is there a time limit when you have to
join
that would would you please find out and
and let either me or Dr Jones know if
you don't mind I'd appreciate it because
I I know one school's in it I'm I'm
thinking we probably need all of them I
know when I scheduled the events uh for
Middle School softball two years ago the
junior Pont was very eager to welcome
all of the Four County schools and I
think we probably need to do it sooner
rather than later right because I'm sure
they already plan it next year
right okay I'm sorry Dr well no go ahead
if you could just share with me your
conversation or get with Miss marck and
she can share with me your conversation
would be good thank you thank you I

County High School we have the Hot Topic
conference March the 23rd in
Williamsburg and we have the virtual

Hancock needs to know who will be going
to the southern region for is that the
one we take the arc to and have it
judged and have the mail in in the

everybody all right thank you is that it
Dr Jones yes sir it is U there's no
unfinished business under new
business um you had a request for an
extension of waiver for rental fees for
communitybased recreation I'll remind
you last year about this time we were
doing um some baseball through the
communities that we actually wave it as
fees for those those baseball teams
which would some would consider the
middle school teams if if we go that
route um this would ex extend that
policy to other sports besides just the
baseball that we approved last year it
would give um I think is Mr Scott
here no yeah he's here oh oh he's in the
back it would you might have to help me
here a little bit but it would give the
discretion to the schools to if if they
beat certain criteria then that would
allow for the waiver correct
that's
appr still require the insurance and all
the things that they requ have been
required in the
past to to other things provided the
principal agrees with it right does
anybody have a is everybody okay with
that I'll make the motion that we do
