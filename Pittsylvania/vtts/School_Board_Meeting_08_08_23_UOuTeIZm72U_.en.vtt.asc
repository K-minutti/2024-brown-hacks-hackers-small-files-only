attention because one of you is going to

know the order
interested okay so you better pay
attention
to Chairman Dallas school board members
into Dr Jones good evening
tomorrow we will officially begin our
2023-24 Academic Year and tonight I will
introduce the character word of the
month of August
our student Representatives will follow
each month with a different character
word I will be focusing on the word
courage the courage to choose grit over
grief
tonight I want to introduce a gentleman
by the name of Alton
ought to excuse me I'll take escape the
Nazi Germany in 1933 with his family
soon after Hitler came into power
they moved North to a city in the
Netherlands where he owned and operated
a manufacturing company over the years
OTA uh watched with concern as Hitler
and the Nazi regime grew more aggressive
and as they invaded the Netherlands
otta was determined to leave Europe with
his family in 1938 he joined over 200
000 Germans who wanted to escape to
United States he reached out to an old
college friend who agreed financially to
support his his family immigration
two years had passed and he still was
awaiting his turn to be interviewed by
the U.S consulate for an immigration
visa surely after the Nazis invaded
Belgium and France the Netherlands U.S
consulate office was bombed and the Visa
applications were destroyed within the
building the state department attempted
to reconstruct the list but for some
reason he nor his family was not listed
shortly after the news worsened as
Germany had ordered for rottingham to
close the U.S
consulate offices and they had to
destroyed all of their visa stamps he
tried to obtain a Cuba Visa but those
efforts also fell as Japan attacked on
Pearl Harbor
for two long years him his family and
his children went into hiding into an
attic above his company's office they
along with four other friends who look
like them on August
of 1944 the Dutch police visited the
facility on a tip that the business had
fraudulently food rationed cars and
illegal employment within the building
all eight individuals were discovered
and they were arrested they were sent to
a different concentration camp in the
region him along with his excuse me his
wife was murdered and his daughters both
died from typhus in the spring of 1945.
he was the only person in his family to
survive the Holocaust
let us remember that carriage's ability
to do something that frightens one
strengthens in the face of pain or grief
in 1947 after the Warhead ended he
returned back to Amsterdam one of his
former employees who helped him by
providing food and supplies while they
were in hiding gave him a book that
belonged to his daughter
after reading the content he decided not
to hide his pain nor his grief but to
publish his daughter's diary the Secret
Annex by Anne Frank
it has silence uh it has since then been
published in at least 70 languages and
have become the most famous testimony to
the Holocaust
Mr Frank died on August the 20th 1980 at
the age of 91. this is 35 years after he
lost his entire family Mr Frank's lesson
to us is that when you seek shelter and
life gives you a closed door you have
the courage to find another one that may
be open when there is no door that is
open for you then you might have to wait
even for two years that is when your
courage has to be temporarily modified
and you have to be encouraged Mr Frank
took a grief and gave the world a gift
his daughter's voice the words when she
was frightened I hope that this story
will inspire each of us to give a
courageous Spirit to continue to provide
our students a positive and excellent
Educational Opportunity this school year
thank you and have a good evening
thank you Mr Harrison
okay up next we have a Public
Presentation of Miss Crystal Lawrence is

Mr Burton
and Mrs Hancock
and good evening Dr Jones
my name is Delilah white and I serve as
the executive director of off season a
non-profit organization designed to
elevate the skills performance and
outcomes of athletes in Pennsylvania
county and Danville Virginia
registered as a 501c3 public charity
off-season's purpose is to empower
athletes through holistic Sports
Development training and education
our mission is to develop the best
athletes in Virginia starting right here
at home
athletes who are mentally physically and
spiritually equipped for competition and
for life
with me tonight is the core leadership
team of off-season education director
Jennifer white Oliver
Sports director Renee shepelman
lead sports trainer Kimberly shaver
and chief development officer
responsible for Grants and resources
Andrea Robbins
on July 13th Mrs White Oliver and I met
with Mrs Craig and Mr Eaton to discuss
partnership opportunities
and how off-season can be a strategic
partner with supporting your Sports
Development efforts in the county
schools
after learning more about the challenges
needs and goals we offered a partnership
opportunity to create and Implement a
sports development program for
Pennsylvania County Middle School
students
to make this happen we would apply for a
grant from the Community Foundation of
the Dan River Region
the grant would provide the startup
resources and materials needed to
implement the program
in January of 2024
we sincerely thank you for your intent
to partner with off season for the
sports development program and I'm here
to tell you more about the Warriors
program one that we designed
specifically for Pittsylvania County
Middle School students and our upcoming
actions on our joint initiative
the Warriors program is an after-school
Sports Development training and
education experience for Pennsylvania
County Middle School students
the goals of the program are to increase
students interest and participation in
their own interscholastic School
athletic programs
to develop well-rounded student athletes
and Community citizens and to provide
extracurricular School based
athletic academic personal development
and nutrition education for students
on Tuesdays and Thursdays as you can see
on the screen from 3 30 to 6 PM middle
school students at all four of the
county middle schools will be able to
participate in football soccer or
basketball Sports Development activities
for one hour after school with an
experienced compassionate and selfless
sports trainer
afterwards they'll eat a nutritious
snack while learning about Sports
Nutrition and then complete one hour of
academic and personal development
activities with a certified K-12
educator
the program will be offered at each
middle school for one consecutive month
eight sessions will be completed in the
spring of 2024 at each school and again
in the fall
for a total of 64 sessions during the
year
the maximum number of participants for
each Sports track is 15 students
that means a total of 45 students per
school will be able to participate in
the program each term
therefore by the end of 2024 the
Warriors program will have provided 360
middle school students with holistic
extracurricular Sports Development and
the primary outcomes of the Warriors
program is to really help Middle School
students parents and community members
adapt to and embrace the new sports
programs that you have made available to
them this year in the middle schools
we are here to support and ensure the
sustainability of the Middle School
inter-scholastic athletic programs
because we share a mutual goal of
overcoming the Sports Development gap
for students and athletes in
Pennsylvania county
we recognize that PCS middle schools are
faced with sports trainers and Equipment
shortages with the start of the new
program
through this grant partnership
off-season is working to fulfill these
needs
if funded off season will provide
overall implementation and management of
the Warriors program
and PCs will provide use of school
athletic facilities and classroom spaces
as needed
with your help thank you chairman Doss
off season did successfully submit the
Grant application to the Community
Foundation on July 27th
first responses from this from the
foundation happen in late September

will be to get back in touch with you

have program intake planned for October
through November of this year
so that we can start the program on time
as scheduled on January 23rd 2024 at

going to tell you why their entire
faculty and staff actually met with us

and the smiles the joys even though we
have struggles right and we talk about
struggles you could tell it's like we're
going to do what's right and what's Best
by our children and the leadership there
is just it's beautiful so I love
elementary school because it's like the
beginning of things and I really I'm
telling you I love going into her school
today
and actually
I gotta ask y'all a question
are you feeling groovy about learning
because you should be that is actually
the theme that Mrs Cox has in her school
and and think about the grooviness of
learning so Dr Jones are you groovy
about learning
are you are you missed calls I mean come
on you got to get with the feel of
learning we all do right that's my
school right I'm telling you is it not
phenomenal I mean with the flowers and
the pictures and the posts yeah
right and I mean when you feel that in
the very beginning you want to carry
that consistently throughout
um and and that's really what we're
leaning on you all to do as you make
your decisions throughout the year to be
groovy about see I'm using that right
now be groovy about learning right and
getting the vibe in the feel and the
flow of it so you're all like oh I
didn't think about it like that it is
it's a Vibe right energy is a Vibe so um
I want you to show off your excitement I
know y'all were talking about your
excitement and that you're excited for
tomorrow you said you're not even in the
classroom you're excited exactly right
right we want to keep that up because
like Thanksgiving is coming y'all and
probably around like I don't know
October or Columbus Day where's
and yeah we will be but we still want to
carry on that level of excitement right
and get in the groove of doing and
feeling positive which will carry
through
right and it's a spirit it's something
that is it's very elusive but you know
it when you see it and you want to
capture it
so in essence and I've done this every
year that I've been here and it's
anything good with teaching what you
begin with you end with it's called
bookending and every school year that
I've stood at this microphone I've given
a prayer over the school division
and today will not be any different
because that spirit is something that we
want to have positive we want that
feeling to remain because we know so
many things in society can dampen that
so when we walk into things with
wide-eyed openness we want to remain in
that same spirit
so we will ask that we be
what is needed
and if you need someone to trust
let you be the person that is
trustworthy
and if you need sympathy
be the person to sympathize
and if you need love
which every single human being does
let you be the person that loves
in full measure not part not cold not
half not none but all
and let you not anger easily
and just be just
permit your Justice to be tempered in
your mercy
and show Grace
to yourself and others
and when you stand before others you
need to look strong and be good and be
honest and loving
and be strong and good and honest and
loving as others look to you
and what you do
for they learn from you and what you do
help and counseling to the anxious
crack the covering of the child and
temper the rambunctiousness of the
gentle attitude
look for justice and peace and harmony
for all Beyond self
permit yourself to only
show and teach the truth
and Inspire everyone
so learning will not cease at any door
May the lessons that you teach
and show others make their lives happy
and fruitful
and permit those lessons to not stop at
your door
in this we ask As you move forward that
you in all things be trustworthy be
truthful do it in love and be in peace
thank you thank you and good luck
tomorrow

so if they were there for a month at the
end of the month my daughter goes to
pick up the granddaughter she didn't
want to leave
and the reason being
it was challenging for them it stretched
their abilities
they were concerned they couldn't get
the work done they worked over and
hardly but they made it they made it
through and did all of it and we're
proud of what they did I I have
heard of this residential gun school for
years the first time I've had somebody
directly involved but that is what we've
kind of always strived for in this
county is more rigor
and stretch our stretch the ability of
our students
and for the most case in my experiences
when you do that our students are more
productive and they enjoy their
education more
and this came to light to me in talking
to these students the special my
granddaughter after they had gone
but it concerns me sometimes what we
look at now
we recently changed our grading schedule
our grading Point schedule
and I'm afraid sometimes that uh
for a better word better like lack of
better words we lower our standards so
we can have a Level Playing Field with
others I would rather others look at us
if we could do something better than the
others and we encourage our kids to do
more but it made my uncle prayer the
fact that talk to them even though they
worked hard they had some hiccups and
had some disadvantages they still want
to complete the work and wanted to stay
and they succeed thank you
any other comments on any of the deaths
reports
okay if not Dr Jones
yes sir I'm going to change the order
and I'm going to go first to to
letting you all know that school be in
some more I think we've talked about
that but also I'd like to thank central
office staff Mr Scott and his staff I'd
like to thank Mrs petting her staff Dr
haymore and her staff and Mr Mayhew and
his staff for the good work that they
did over the summer in preparation for
this school year I'd also like to thank
our teachers for the good work that
they've done really over the summer
because many of our teachers work
throughout the summer if they're not
working at some job or working with
students somehow they're surely planning
and preparing for the school year you
know while teachers have a 10-month kind
of contract they are surely working 12
months a year so we greatly appreciate
their good work and our staff is what
makes Pennsylvania County Schools a good
place to learn and work and it's what
they do each and every day and it just
going back and looking at the summer and
what all we have accomplished this
summer whether it's maintenance or
whether it's summer school or whether
it's the regional governance school that
we host or it's a residential government
school that we send our children to
summer school graduation you know a lot
goes on and and I think our staff we do
it for the students of Pennsylvania
county and I feel very very proud of
what we accomplished in Pennsylvania
county we look at these young people
right here our seniors a great
representation of our School Division so
I'd like to start by saying that this
uh also I'd like to share with you some
things that that I think I'd like to
bring you up to speed on the first is
information regarding the sales tax
referendum uh right now uh Mr Hudson
is in the planning with Mr Scott are
planning for the utilization of those
funds you know that the the revenues
began coming in July 1 of 23 we're going
to monitor that with our County to see
how the revenues track in then that will
give us a good indication of what that
will look like we'll work with our
finance department and Mrs Worley to to
plan out how we will seek those funds
and utilize those funds to to to do
capital projects particularly on our
elementary schools we're going to look
at safety vestibules in our 10
elementary schools and for middle
schools we're going to look at
eliminating our mobile units and
bringing the students inside with indoor
classrooms connecting our gyms our
detached gyms
and then installing Windows and and new
HVAC units across the division so a lot
of work will take place Mr Scott
mentioned the work that is taking place
this summer in the maintenance we've
done a whole lot this summer Mr Hudson
has been very extremely busy something
that we're going to do this fall is
we're going to again I think I'm going
to
reiterate some things that Mr Scott said
but we're going to install ballistic
tape up in our schools that will deter
entrance a quick entry into our schools

discussed and we're going to implement
another item I'd like to bring in
