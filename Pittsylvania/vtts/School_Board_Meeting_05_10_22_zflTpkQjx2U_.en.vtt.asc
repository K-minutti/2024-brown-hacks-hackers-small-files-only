ms merrick aye mr moon aye mr mills and
mr bowser are absent
and uh public presentations
yeah okay we've got uh dr irwin
would come up for his presentation
um i'm here tonight to represent
pennsylvanians for a brighter future
which is the political action committee
that is trying to help get past the one
percent sales tax for construction of
schools
and so i'm here just to keep it at your
forefront so that you all will think
about it we're asking for all of the
board members help to help support this
you all voted for this so we're asking
for you to help us and to give you just
a quick update of what we've been doing
um you should hear from one of the
committee members at each meeting
since the last since the last school
board meeting we've spoken to ten groups
including the hurt gretna chatham town
councils four elementary schools a board
of supervisors and two organizations and
we plan to continue speaking to these
groups
we received almost forty thousand
dollars in donations which is right at
the budget amount that we had so we're
pretty good fundraising wise from that
we've just engaged jonathan parker with
parker productions to guide the
publicity and the social media managing
for both our instagram facebook pages
he will also help with a mail campaign
strategy that we're looking to roll out
here pretty soon
an article was published in the may 4
star tribune and we just had an
interview yesterday with wsct abc out of
lynchburg covering the need for the one
percent sales tax
videos are being uploaded to the website
and the website should be up and
operational
here within the week
on the radio mr fitzgerald has
thankfully secured radio spots and
interviews for wkby
beginning august 8th and continuing
through november 8th 60 second
commercials played every other hour
following the weather we also hope to
have students talk in those commercials
at times also which we think will be a
big benefit
we've ordered received over 200 yard
signs 20 000 copies of the flyers
and last four years registered voters to
add to the mailing list
we're still looking for volunteers
and so this is where i come to you all
tonight is to help us with the
volunteers we'd like each of you to win
your district with this and so you all
got elected
so we know that you know people in your
district that will volunteer that will
support this so we just like to ask for
some of their names people that are
vocal people that can talk about it at
different sporting events at different
fire events different things throughout
your district that's where we need the
help with right now so we can plan this
out through the summer to make sure we
have enough people at those at those
events it failed last year about 14
votes and the overriding theme was that
people just weren't educated enough
about it
and so our goal is to make sure we
educate them to understand that the 50
million dollars has to go to school
construction
and that it offsets approximately a
eight to nine cent uh per hundred real
estate tax increase so it's going to be
taxed some way or another we're just
trying to spread it out more evenly
so thank you for your time tonight as i
said we'll be in front of you i may even
be back with more things but we
appreciate your support of it and
anything we can do or any thoughts you
have please contact myself or dr walker
all right the next is character word of
the month it's citizenship
i think the fourth student
representatives have put together a
powerpoint slides for us to review
good evening dr jones distinguished
members of the board and pennsylvania
county community my fellow student
representatives and i worked together to
create a presentation on the character
word of the month citizenship
so i'll
speak on my part now
citizenship is defined as a relationship
between an individual and a state to
which the individual
owes allegiance and in turn is entitled
to its protection
this could be towards your country state
community and school but after reading
this definition i wonder what qualities
make up citizenship i believe that our
past character words have all added up
to give us the qualities of a good
citizen
courage honesty trustworthiness respect
courtesy responsibility self-control
fairness and caring it really is not
required of anyone to be a good citizen
but it is beautiful to recognize and
appreciate how many people do so freely
so many people want to help others and
inspire others so many people give back
what they can in so many ways through
time money or energy to me being a good
citizen is one of the most important
roles i want to thank all of the people
in my community who has been a good
citizen and inspired me
citizenship to me is how each one of us
contributes to the betterment of our
community
picking up litter holding a door driving
the speed limit and even participating
in local government
as we are tonight are simple ways anyone
can practice being a good citizen
citizenship requires kindness
responsibility and trustworthiness all
qualities that help make the world a
better place for us all when we each
take the initiative to show selflessness
for those around us
practicing good citizenship through
involvement in the betterment of our
community helps us come together as
neighbors become friends and friends
become family
kindness and empathy towards others are
the pinnacle of what it means to be a
good citizen
in our ever-changing world the biggest
impact that can be made any and every
day is demonstrating the best of what
citizenship is and showing appreciation
for the ways others citizenship impacts
you
there are many ways people can
participate in good citizenship to me
one way in which i have learned how to
be a good citizen is by being a member
of jrotc one of the most important
things that cadets are taught is how to
be a good citizen i have participated in
a plethora of activities to help our
community including picking up trash
practicing participating in parades and
volunteering for donation drives these
activities have led me to become
involved in the community and i am very
thankful for the many opportunities to
learn how to be a good citizen we can
all benefit from these kinds of
activities to be better citizens besides
these activities being kind and generous
to others and courteous to other
citizens can lead to a better community
i think we can all benefit from learning
from one another and becoming better
citizens
as the other student representatives
have presented
citizenship is a
position or status we are granted by
being part of the united states but also
how we use this status to help enhance
our country and especially the
communities around us
we can bring forth this enhancement by
being a good citizen a good citizen
follows the rules and laws set forth in
their community
respects others
shows kindness when met with rudeness
and does what they can to help others no
matter the circumstance
i have practiced good citizenship by
volunteering with my church
on various occasions as well as becoming
involved in the local school board
we can all come together to practice
good citizenship and enhance our
communities over the past year i have
learned much about what it means to be
to be a good citizen
involved citizen sorry involved citizen
by being a good representative i hope to
have demonstrated and continue to
demonstrate what it means to be a good
citizen as this chapter comes to an end
and a new one begins
i'm forever grateful for this experience
and thank you parents teachers and board
members and others that allowed us to
serve as the pcs student representatives
so
as you all can see we're in good hands

to recognize them they have worked
extremely hard over the last two years
to provide
meals
for students

very fortunate to have a tremendous
cafeteria staff and we recognize them on

who is the tussle high school concert
percussion ensemble director he was
inducted into
the hall of fame the winter guard hall

him this evening as well
we didn't have him come there but he was
at a concert at tunstall high school
a month ago
and then would like to again remind you
that the today show visited chatham

watched the day show that morning many
others saw a video clip of that

our staff there for even staff at
central office and our students it's
something that they will remember for a
lifetime

jennifer williams who was donating her
goals to donate 1 million books to
students and children

the time

students 16 years and older as well as
the goodwill summer youth program work
program for students age 14 and 15. i'd

packet we sent a letter to the county
administrator on april the 19th
requesting
the repair of the bridge on route 57 and
that's between
route 649 north and route 649 south
the response from the county
administrator was placed in board docs
this morning
he
they have shared the information with
jay craddock at vdot
and he stated that he would pass this
along to the bridge section of the
district engineer so that's what that is
right now mr fitzgerald
like to
let you all know that this sunday will
be baccalaureate services at our high
gretna high school will be may 22nd at 8
o'clock in the morning at the high
school dan river high school may 22nd at
8 30.
chatham high school may 22nd
at 9 o'clock
and tunstall high school is may 22nd and
i'm gonna look is that nine o'clock
8 30 8 30 there
up and then in your pack at upcoming
vspa conferences there's a hybrid school
law conference june the 3rd at the
hilton in richmond at short pump
the sba conference on education is july
the 19th
and that's to be determined
and then vsb
annual conference november the 16th
through the 18th in williamsburg and we
hope that we'll be able to return to
williamsburg uh this coming november and
that's all i had this evening
uh mr
moon okay thank you
at this time under unfinished business
we'll get an update from ms kelly marks
on the uh student dress code
um i submitted to
both chairman daus and dr jones an
updated dress code
i look on the document that was included
with
what i see tonight and it is by no means
what i had intentions of
with the updated dress code i spent days
in and out
when i'm passionate about something i'm
going to research it to the end
we're living in a society now that we
cannot take the approach that
girls can't dress a certain way
and we can't hinder learning
environments
either
so i do ask that we re-evaluate this i
didn't take the dress code and look at
specific parts of pittsburgh county
because i think it's several sections
that need to be addressed so i created
an entirely new dress code to focus on
this material and i looked at lots of
dress codes throughout the entire state
of virginia so it was including
from north to south east to west and
i do ask that we reevaluate this as mr
burton mentioned earlier we have student
representatives that voice their opinion
and i'm not quite certain they were
heard
so i do think we need to reevaluate
where we have a lot of we can't in the
dress code and i think we need to remove
some of those and put a lot of we can
because it's the job of teachers and
administrators to
educate students on their teaching
healthy and respectful ways and i think
it's time that we address that
okay thank you
also we need to look at the july
disciplinary
committee meeting
uh we could even look at having it on
june the 6th or july the 11th if it's
june the 6th it would be the july
disciplinary committee to her reviews
with that do we have a recommendation
on what date we would like to have the
this july disciplinary committee held on
so are you going to have it july period
or do we need to back it up to junior
well they we got on here on june the 6th
it didn't even need to be june 6 or july
they're live months
probably june the 6th may suit uh miss
merricks
you're on that and uh
mr doss is on that right um
i can't speak for mr doss but is june
the sixth okay with you ms merricks
i'm pretty certain it will be
let's let's go for that day and if it
needs to be changed then we can come
back okay
all right her emotion on that that we go
with june the 6th i'll make that motion
a second
okay all in favor for roll call
mr burton
aye mr fitzgerald aye ms henderson aye
ms merricks aye mr moon aye mr mills and
mr doss are absent
the next one on is the 20
22 2023 student representatives that
we've had up here in front of us tonight
we need to have a motion and a second to
approve these individuals to be the
student representatives for the upcoming
fiscal year i'll make that motion that
we accept them not a second okay all in
fact
mr burton aye mr fitzgerald aye ms
henderson aye ms merritt aye mr moon aye
mr mills and mr dallas are absent
the next one would be the additional
representation on the minority advisory
council for 2022 and 2023
do we need any additional representation
on the advisory council
i think we do i'd like to make a motion
that we extend that and expand it if
possible
you you want to have a limit on what we
would expand it to uh
am i correct miss hancock is two per
district is that right
currently it's one person one per
district okay i would like to see it
move to at least two
and that is in the form of emotion
all right do i have a second
a second okay any additional discussion
on the two per
district which i would give a total of
what 14
out of the seven districts that we have
how is the attendance of those meetings
now
we only have what
twice a year yes we have this twice a
year
it's less than
half a ten
i think that's one of the reasons to
expand it to get more get more
participants
available and present
mr burton the last meeting was a virtual
meeting as well that's been an issue i
know
yeah
i'll ask the question how they put on
the
board or whatever the last time that
we each representative from their
community uh picked a
candidate
i'm assuming we'll still continue to do
that except maybe expand it to two
so willie mr fischer you would
you would have two from your area
okay as well as everybody else would
i just didn't know the process yeah okay
gotcha
okay we're going to motion in the second

you have one more item you got one other
item yeah
did i miss it
they added i don't remember what it is
now does anybody have anything to say
about the student representatives at
this time while they are here
i had my say
i would like to say something about our
students if i might just take a second
i am thoroughly impressed with what we
have as our future leaders
i was invited to judge some competition
at the
governor's school two weeks ago
i was just
blown away
people who presented their projects and
the in-depth time and effort
that they put into it
um just outstanding some of those
governor's two students are here tonight
are you please stand if you are any
anybody yeah hey my hat's off to you
but not only them
their presentations were just
outstanding thank you for that but not
only them
are representatives
those who were
recognized tonight for their attendance
and the gpas and so forth
if america
is fortunate enough to have people like
that we're gonna be okay i guarantee you
thank you i know it
it makes you feel good about our faculty
and staff and administration on what
they've been able to accomplish here in
pennsylvania county and be able to send
these young people out in the world
being ambassadors for pennsylvania
county and
also representing themselves and their
families so we'd like to say thank you
also to each one of you
thank you for your dedication as this
chapter closes another one's going to
open have fun with it you're going to
only be a student one time in college
have fun with it best of luck
i would like to ask the representatives
if there's anything they would like to
share with
the up-and-coming group anything you
guys would like to share with them
put you on the spot this evening
um definitely take advantage of this
whole experience honestly it's been so
much fun to get involved in our local
government and i've learned how
important it is to get involved at this
base level and how important local
government is to our lives and everyone
else's lives around us
and it's really cool to be a part of it
and to be
even more immersed in my school
community i really appreciate this
opportunity
um yeah i would just say that you
kind of really recognize how important
local government is i don't think that i
really understood like how much the
school board does
in our everyday lives and how much more
impact they have than some of even the
state and the federal government has
over us so i think it's really cool to
kind of realize that
also i would just say you know as a
little piece of advice
if you have a problem with something or
if you have comments say them because
even if it's not necessarily taken if
you know it just ends up that your
opinion is not what ends up needing to
happen um at least you know that you
voiced it and that there are other
options and i would just say that you
your voice really does matter because
you are speaking for the students at
your school and that's really important
um so yeah and just have fun with it it
shouldn't be very very stressful but it
is fun to meet the other students and to
get to know the school board members and
everything like that so
just have fun and soak it all in you
will learn so much because i know i did
and i enjoyed every moment that i got to
be here
um just yeah the school board members
they're very
very um knowledgeable and i they know
what they're doing
i think
and um to the next school board
representatives
um no the speeches don't get easier
every time you go up there but
you'll get through them so yeah
thank you guys thank you
mr fitzgerald ah mr henderson all right
miss merrick all right mr moon aye mr
mills and mr bowser absent
thank you all for coming and
participating
