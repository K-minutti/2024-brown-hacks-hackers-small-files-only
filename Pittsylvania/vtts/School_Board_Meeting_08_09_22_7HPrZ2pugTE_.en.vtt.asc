so y'all watching pay close attention
good evening to chairman dolls to the
school board members
earlier today we officially began our
2022-23 academic year and i'm proud to
introduce the character word for the
month of august
our student representatives will be
following each month with a different
character word so tonight i will focus
on the word of courage with a poem that
was written by nicole warner
courage
courage to speak up
courage to stand up
courage to say yes
encouraged to say no
courage to make a change to view
something in a new light
courage to let go
and the courage to go
after
courage to start
courage to end
courage to walk away or
to sit still
courage to grow
courage also to stop
everything begins with courage may god
bless our school division with the
wisdom needed for this great 2022
academic year thank you
thank you mr harrison
next we have pennsylvanians for a
brighter future ms mccluster i see you
going to speak to us tonight welcome
good to see you you too
pull this down because i know at our
meetings nobody can hear
all right good evening mr chairman
members of the board dr jones staff and
members of the community i'm kaylen
mccluster and i live in the stanton
river district and i'm here tonight
speaking on the vote yes for pcs
campaign
i know you all are very familiar with
the sales tax question that's going to
be on the referendum in november
and
we have the opportunity to approve this
new 1 sales tax that's going to generate
approximately 3.8 million dollars it's
important for every voter in the county
to understand that this new revenue may
only be used for school construction and
or renovation
this sales tax will not apply to
groceries medication or certain
agricultural products i think that's a
huge thing that everyone needs to
understand it's not completely across
the board it's you know a lot of people
i've had a lot of questions on that but
there are those exceptions in there
we also know that surrounding areas have
already passed this they've already
implemented that one percent sales tax
for school improvements so when we're
over there and we're shopping in their
communities we're helping them to pay
for their schools in their city and
those counties and this is the way to
allow everybody that comes through hours
to shop to help us
i love the fact that he just spoke on
the word courage i think that's very
important when it does come to this
it does take courage to stand up and ask
people will you please vote yes for a
one percent sales tax increase
but this is for our schools it is for
our children
it has to be in my opinion the most fair
tax there is it doesn't matter your
social status it doesn't matter where
you live you don't have to be a resident
of the county if you're here shopping
you are helping to pay for that and our
kids deserve that um i'm also going to
speak on
myself being a parent with children in
the county schools
and we all know that crime and violence
have become common in the schools across
the nation and our children need and
deserve the safer entrances that allow
school personnel to better secure the
buildings as a parent myself i am
concerned not only about my children but
all the children in the county and there
are so many that are still in mobile
units outside there is no security for
those children
if this is a way that we can stand up
and have that courage to make that
change
this is huge it is absolutely huge for
the residents of this county for the
children that are in our schools they
need and they deserve that safety and we
as parents
deserve to feel that our children are
safe when we when they go to school a
lot of the schools right now don't even
have the safety vestibule when you come
in and that is huge when i go to pick my
kids up from school i promise you
nobody's getting in that school they you
know they have a camera they want to see
you
i love that a lot of schools don't have
that and it is very very much needed
so tonight i'm just here to thank you
all for your investment in this effort
and i would love for you all to continue
your support we would love for anybody
that is willing to come out help us at
the polls we're going to have community
meetings there are going to be you know
football games that are starting up
anything that you can think is community
related chances are we're going to be
there we're going to be standing there
with flyers we're going to be there
asking you know helping to answer
questions that are asked there are a lot
of questions and this did fail by only
14 votes last year so
that's a very very small margin of
people that we do have to win over and i
think the biggest misconception is that
they don't truly understand what this is
for it doesn't go to salaries it doesn't
go to
any kind of operating things it's all
for improvements and construction for
these schools and that's extremely
important we have a website we have a
facebook page if any of you would like
to go on there you can share it if
anybody that's watching would like to
reach out and volunteer please you can
email dr jones
any of your school board members they
will be happy you know to get anybody in
touch with the proper channels to be on
our committee um if you have any
questions i'll be glad to answer them if
not i thank you for your time
thank you ms mcclasson thank you and i
hope to see you at the polls again this
year because you were there all day last
year because i was rain or not
you were thank you thank you
you know i don't know if this is correct
that's what i was told so don't hold me
to it if it's wrong i'm apologize but
i've been told as much as 30
of the revenues and surrounding areas
are being collected from out of county
residents
so that means for every dollar they
spend it on construction 30 cents of
that is being paid by somebody outside
the county just like i go to danville
and shop or whatever
so i think you're right it is a huge way
to get our schools
renovated and improved without really
hurting the taxpayers that bad
so i hope everybody will
at least look at it very close and
understand how this what the one percent
is for and how it works because i think
if you do you'll understand it's very
important that we go this way
thank you i appreciate your help
we also have a presentation of support
from the naacp i'm going to ask mr scott
if he will to read it please
good evening
our school division is in receipt of the
following kind letter of support written
by the pennsylvania county branch of the
naacp
on august 2nd
2022 in support of the upcoming ballot
referendum for the proposed 1 percent
increase in our county's sales tax
attention dr mark jones mr calvin doss
and school board members
on behalf of the pennsylvania county
branch of the naacp
national association for the advancement
of colored people we are once again
submitting this letter in support of the
one percent tax increase proposed for
the november 8th
2022 election
we are supporting this increase with the
understanding that it is to be used
towards renovation of the county's 10
elementary schools and the pennsylvania
career and technical center
the decision to support the increase has
been recorded in our minutes from our
last meeting on july 5th
2022 and will be kept on record for
future reference yours truly anita
royston president
thank you mr scott the naacp has been a
huge supporter of pennsylvania county
schools for many years dating way back
to mr fitzgerald
and i want to thank them for their
support and continued support and being
a partner with us because it truly takes
the community
to help do this so thank
thank you for the naacp for this support
next we have our pennsylvania county
education association dr jessica jones i
see you sitting in the back you wait
did you have a good day today
good
thank you we appreciate it we look
forward to seeing you next month
uh under staff and committee reports is
next we have a summer piedmont regional
government school
who's
mr harrison you gonna
think i've got your name by that
you get the next two so you can talk
about the regional school and the
governor the other summer governor
school okay okay which one would you
like to hear from let's go ahead with
the regional governor's school first
okay the
piedmont summer regional governor's
school right that is my
my program okay uh which was held the
third and fourth week of june uh we had
368 students who participated from seven
school divisions and from five private
schools and so this is our 39th year
in holding this activity here in
pennsylvania county at chatham high
school
pennsylvania county has been very
fortunate in being able to host this it
was created again
39 years ago with miss avery wyatt and
will continue to serve as the catalyst
for our fourth through seventh grade
students to be able to embark upon a
summer enrichment program
that allowed them to come together with
like-mindedness of other
students of their age and to be able to
participate in activities along with
field trips which was the 36 field trips
excuse me
and so our students were able to
to fully participate in this
not
on campus
last year we did have to go partially
remote and again we just support those
other school divisions that have helped
with with this if it was not for the
support of the pistol man county school
board with this
then more than likely this event would
have to be housed somewhere else and so
um students from franklin county bedford
county campbell county often those
students are having to travel each day
or each
going to chatham high into back
roughly approximately about an hour hour
and 15 minutes ride and so our students
are able to have this locally within
their own backyard and so we do thank
you for your support we do thank you for
um being a great um
supporter of our gift to students not
only for pennsylvania county but for
our region as well
and so the second
program is summer residential governor's
school yes summer residential governor's
school program we had five students who
were able to participate in that
three of those students um were with the
humanities
that took place at radford university
and so that is a four-week program that
is designated for
rising
10th and 11th grade students
who were able to participate and so we
did have
again five or five students from the
county who was able to participate
pennsylvania county schools provide the
tuition full tuition for those students
and their support and so again we do
thank the board
for your
dedication and for your financial
support to allow this to be possible for
our students so thank you
thank you mr harrison we appreciate all
the hard work you do with the gifted mr
dolls mr dos
we also have one of our school board
representatives was at the some
residence who governor school program
this summer which one
who went
you want to tell us if you think a
little bit what you did
so i went to the summer residential
governor's school at the university of
lynchburg it was the
science technology and mathematics one
um
it was a wonderful program i'd like to
thank mr harrison for
putting me on to that
i took a four week long meteorology
program and it actually swayed my major
and now i'm going to go to school for
that so
thank you i appreciate that thank you dr
jones let me know

yes sir mr dahl school board members um
each of our assistant superintendents
and departments have been very busy this
summer as illustrated by mr scott and
his department
instruction support services and human
resources have been extremely busy to
ensure that our buildings schools are
ready for students to return and i think
that was evidence of last thursday night
with open house and then the day there
seems to be a lot of excitement uh in
returning to school this year uh what
seems to be some getting back to normal
and i think people are feeling that and
really feeling
you know how
how well we how good we have it in
pennsylvania county i think i think our
students and staff are just very
appreciative of your support over the
last couple of years and i'm very
appreciative of staff and students and
what we've had to deal with for the past
couple of years so thanks to everyone
in our community and our schools for
what you've done
last
beginning
since our last meeting we've had our
principals meeting we've had new teacher
new staff orientation
we have had
open houses last week
beginning schools today so a lot has
taken place since our last meeting
new this year
we have opening at our stem academy we
have a 9th 10th grade transition program
that if you recall was begun a couple of
years ago but because of code we delayed
the start date till this year today
i was there miss petty was there and i
think probably several of them is
written i'm sure you were there today
just had a very good day with our 9th
and 10th graders coming in there if you
recall those students will take
environmental science they'll take
biology they'll take career connections
1 and 2 and they'll take medical science
1 and 2. you know if you look back to
five or six years ago we first met with
miss joan hendricks at our career and
technical center and we brought um
averitt university's uh nursing program
in to talk about our our
nursing health medical sciences program
in pennsylvania county and how to
enhance that and ms hendricks said what
we need to do first is we need to look
at medical sciences and so we're there
now we're offering that
bridge program from
the career the career connections
opportunities that we have in middle
bridging that with the opportunities
that we have at current technical center
our governor's school and aet in 11th
and 12th grade now we have a bridge
there but in with ninth and tenth grade
so that began today we also have new
this year miss petty and mr harrison are
looking at
pushing in our stem teachers into our
elementary schools and so they will be
out into our elementary schools
providing stem education for those
students
also
new this year and i want to be sure i'm
right we also have our industrial
maintenance robotics program is fully uh
being implemented this school year is
that correct i'm looking there for
nod there so a lot going on as far as
new programs in the beginning of school
but most importantly i think i see with
staff and students i think we're feeling
just maybe relief that we're back and
we're back somewhat to normal
i will talk a little bit later in my
comments to you all about what may be
the only thing that may be different
this year regarding covid but i'll talk
about that in a few minutes so any
questions that you all have i know that
you all have been in buildings over the
last few days any questions you all have
about beginning of school
i'll make a comment or two because i
want some of the staff to hear it i
spent most of the thursday afternoon at
twin springs
then i would visit careertech and went
chatham middle at the end of the day
but i was really impressed not only with
the condition of the buildings how clean
they were
and how they looked but also
the
attitude of staff and parents it's clean
springs it was full all afternoon
couldn't get a car anywhere else on the
lot i didn't see anybody get upset
nobody was rushed everybody was handled
the staff was just tickled to death to
see people
you can sit there and talk to bus
drivers for a while
they were in the cafeteria to meet
people talk about bus rats
but i talked to mr parker before i left
and complimenting him on how well things
went he even had a man had to do balloon
animals to entertain the kids who were
waiting to go around to the different
classes
uh so i was very impressed on how well
the staff handled and how well the
parents were i do know that miss dawson
is really proud of her new ceiling she
shows me every time i go in the building
maybe next year we'll take care of that
too
anybody else
i went to three schools mr burton that
afternoon and it was uh i did see a lot
of excitement in the students and
parents and you're right it was um they
did a good job well i guess what
surprised me
that i saw was a lot of them were there
at 1 30 instead of at 5 30. they were
there early
over my way
so i thought they did a really good job
a lot of happy people and a lot of happy
students back
it looked like
mr dawes may i ask the student reps if
they have any anything about first day
of school can i put you guys on the spot
anything you'd like to share
so today was kind of like
eye opening to how different school had
been the past two years
and i know none of us have gotten a full
normal
year of high school because our freshman
year was when kovid
shut everything down second semester so
i'm really just looking forward to
hopefully having a normal year of high
okay thank you dr jones yes sir a couple
other items i have up in your packet we
have a draft policy from middle school
sports and i think you all would like to
discuss this during a work session later
but i did provide that for you all
i won't go go over it at this time
unless you'd like for me to we'll do it
in the work session okay
it's going to be in depth so we probably
need to really point to the work section
next item i have just an update on sales
tax referendum
we were at
the pacific for a brighter future were
at each of the open houses there was a
table set up they had volunteers there
to pass out flyers
we had representatives at the back to
school events this past saturday and
then this prior saturday in danville
one was at pcca and one was at the silas
mar four park both of those in chatham
then we have a pair teacher organization
meeting scheduled for this fall
if you are available uh if you'd like to
participate please let me know or just
be there that evening but that that
schedule is is there

stoney meal september 22nd at 6
mount airy september 29th at 6
south side september 29th at 6 and then
denver middle october 13th at 6.
i think it's in there but i'll shoot
that to you as an email
and then the last item i have
the last time i have are the covet
protocols and this is the only coveted
protocol that we have right now other
than that then if
if a student or a staff member wishes to
wear a mask they can
but
protocol
cover protocol for someone who has
coveted is that they should remain at
home for the first five days
and if they're fever-free with no
symptoms they can come back on days six
through ten as long as they wear a mask
um and so those that is the extent to
right now our
protocols for covet
and i think that's all i have other than
the vsba meetings you have the the
advisory legislative advisory conference

okay yeah
okay
okay under unfinished business freedom
of choice program information dr jones i
think you received some information from
that group yes sir we've received some
information um and the committee
and so right now our committee is
reviewing the possibility of a wood
plaque uh 24 by 36 that would state the
top recognition of students who
participated in the freedom of choice
program at the four pennsylvania county
high schools
this committee would cover the cost of
the plaque
and the principle each school would
determine where the plaque will be
located
the freedom of choice committee members
would also like to meet with the
building committee of the school board
to to discuss these items at a later
date
mr henderson you are over the building
committee and i think mr moon and myself
are on it i would like to try to do that
relatively quick
i'm good uh for
do you have any preference
in preference nights
no
i'd like to go ahead as soon as possible
and get it out
yeah you know i would totally it may be
some discussion so i'd like to go ahead
and try to get it early
i said it tonight okay let's set the
meeting
let me get to
so she's got the 16th the 23rd of the
30th and they all tuesday nights
i'm good any of the three i've got um
we've got governor's school meeting on
the 30th so that may not be a good night
and we'll probably be through in time
but you're gonna be the 16th yeah that's
fine
16. yeah how quick can you get here mr
moon i can make it at whatever time 5 30
6.
shoot 5 30. that's fine okay 5 30.
thank you we'll shoot for the 16th at 5
30 then
okay is that all you have on that dr
jones yes sir may i ask a question about
that
have the high school's been contacted
what i'm thinking about
it would be nice if they could get a
similar place in all the buildings
not have one plaque or one in the
building another building
i don't believe we've done any of that
work have witnessed
we just got
the other day
they just gave miss hancock what they
wanted to do remember they were here
last year one flag with all of your
names they were here last month you know
we told them to come back with
everything she just got that a couple of
days ago so
that that's just the thing in my mind
might want to try to have similar
location
i'll definitely dr jones if you'll
remind us that what's going on the
comments
last time in the building they've got a
lot of stuff on their walls a lot of
stuff and then
all right
under new business a broadband lease and
easement agreement between brownsville
elementary and river street networks
movie approved
any discussion was touching you good
with all of this you looked at it i'm
sure
henderson aye
mr mills aye mr moon aye mr doss hi
and the final thing is the
superintendent's evaluation tool
we need to approve that it has changed
slightly right yes it has it it mirrors
the principal and the teacher's
evaluation
so it's just something new the state
requires and it's a change so we need to
approve it
i'll make the motion i'll second it
any discussion well the question i was
going to answer this is because some
state has changed
any other questions
all right mr fitzgerald mr henderson all
right chris merricks all right mr
meadows all right mr mankind all right
mr dobbs aye i'm entertaining a motion i
make a motion with a journey another
second hold on please
mr burton aye
mr fitzgerald aye mr henderson aye mr
eric aye ms mills aye
aye mr
thank you all for being here
appreciate y'all
