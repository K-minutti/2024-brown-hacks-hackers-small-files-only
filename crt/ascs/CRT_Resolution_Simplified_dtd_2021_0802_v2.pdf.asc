                           RESOLUTION OPPOSING PRINCIPLES OF CRITICAL RACE THEORY. 
                                                                       
                  
                 A RESOLUTION OF THE BOARD OF EDUCATION (BOE) OF EL PASO COUNTY 
                 COLORADO SCHOOL DISTRICT 49 (D49), DECLARING ITS OFFICIAL OPPOSITION TO 
                 PRINCIPLES OF CRITICAL RACE THEORY. 
                  
                 WHEREAS, Nothing in this resolution shall be construed to restrict any expressive activities 
                 protected under the Constitution, including academic freedom or student political speech; and 
                  
                 WHEREAS, Nothing in this resolution shall require any staff member to violate federal or state 
                 law; and 
                  
                 WHEREAS, The BOE affirms its commitment and expectation that teachers will rely on the 
                 Colorado Academic Standards as the authoritative source for the content of instruction to provide a 
                 comprehensive education on America’s history that neither sanitizes its past, nor denies the 
                 possibility of moral progress; and 
                  
                 WHEREAS, The Colorado Constitution, in Article IX, Section 15, declares that the directors of 
                 each local school district <shall have control of instruction in the public schools of their respective 
                 districts,= and C.R.S. 22-32-109 sets forth the role of this Board to <determine the educational 
                 programs to be carried on in the schools of the district and to prescribe the textbooks for any course 
                 of instruction or study in such programs.=; and  
                  
                 WHEREAS, Public Education, properly designed, includes age-appropriate, critical thinking about 
                 the history, philosophies, and structures which comprise the American experience, including 
                 pertinent instruction regarding the founding ideals of our nation as well as the history of racism and 
                 inequality in America; and 
                  
                 WHEREAS, it is consistent with District 49’s cultural compass to use culturally respectful teaching 
                 approaches to give guidance on how to use the cultural knowledge, prior experiences, frames of 
                 reference, and learning styles of ethnically diverse students to make learning encounters more 
                 relevant to and effective for them. 
                  
                 NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED AS FOLLOWS: 
                  
                 D49 will not use principles of Critical Race Theory (as described below) as a curriculum for 
                 classroom instruction. With this statement, D49 reiterates that: 
                        Neither schools, nor instructors, shall assign individuals or groups of students to participate 
                         in class or complete assignments based on their racial identity.  
                        Schools shall not engage in racial bias or stereotyping. 
                  
                 BE IT ALSO RESOLVED THAT: 
                 District leaders and staff shall not promote the following principles associated with Critical Race 
                 Theory in D49’s classroom curricula: 
                                                                       
                        Race Essentialism: The assertion that race is the most important identity 
                        Collectivism: The assertion that group identity is more important than individual identity 
                        Accusatory characterization of individuals as oppressor or oppressed according to their race 
                  
                 BE IT ALSO RESOLVED THAT: 
                 District 49 will continue to embrace and implement the tenets of our Vision and Mission, the 
                 Cultural Compass and Strategic Priorities (Big Rocks) in how we approach our work and how we 
                 treat each other 
                  
                  
                  
                 ADOPTED THIS 12th DAY OF AUGUST, 2021
