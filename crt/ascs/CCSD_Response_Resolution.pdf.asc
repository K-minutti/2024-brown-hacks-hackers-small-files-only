      A RESOLUTION OF THE BOARD OF EDUCATION OF THE CLARKE 
      COUNTY SCHOOL DISTRICT IN RESPONSE TO THE GEORGIA STATE 
      BOARD OF EDUCATION RESOLUTION 
       
      In a May 20, 2021 letter, Governor Brian Kemp called upon the Georgia State Board of 
      Education to “take immediate steps to ensure that Critical Race Theory and its 
      dangerous ideology do not take root in our state standards or curriculum.”   
      In a special June 3 meeting of the Board a resolution was passed that Governor Kemp 
      responded “with their vote today, state school board members have ensured education 
      in the Peach State will reflect the freedom, equality, and God-give potential of each 
      individual.” 
      The Clarke County School Board has neither participated in a discussion Critical Race 
      Theory nor engaged in the development of curriculum.  Indeed, it was the actions of the 
      Governor that publicized this academic concept. 
      Still, the Clarke County School Board is called upon to respond to the resolution passed 
      by the State Board of Education that we believe hinders free speech, undermines the 
      professionalism of our teaching staff and seeks to erase aspects of the history of this 
      nation.  In response to the State Board’s resolution, the Clarke County School Board 
      counters with the following core beliefs regarding race and the history of the United 
      States:  
        1.  Believes that the racial disparity in the United States and in Georgia that exists in 
         wealth, home ownership, health/life expectancy, education, career attainment 
         and portrayals in literature are  rooted in history, 
        2.  Affirms both the history of unequal treatment based on race and the history of 
         efforts to end these disparities, 
        3.  Affirms that education in Georgia should seek to establish the fundamental 
         values of freedom, equality, and the potential of every individual, 
         4.  Affirms that we do not blame students or families of any race for the history of 
           inequities of the past related to wealth, home ownership, health/life expectancy, 
           education career attainment or portrayals in literature, 
         5.  Believes that public education in Georgia should teach (a) no one race or sex is 
           inherently superior to another race or sex; (b) a student, by virtue of his or her 
           race or sex is not inherently racist, sexist or oppressive whether consciously or 
           unconsciously; (c) to the degree that such racist, sexist or oppressive ideas are 
           present, they are a reflection of socialization rooted in history; (d) a student 
           should not be made to feel discomfort, guilt, anguish, or any other firm of 
           psychological distress on account of his or her race or sex; (e) instead, when 
           studying the economic, political and social  nature of the U.S., a student should 
           be encourage to use of inductive reasoning (make an observation, ask a question, 
           form a hypothesis or testable explanation, make a prediction based on the 
           hypothesis, test the prediction with more evidence and use the results to make 
           new hypotheses or predictions.); (f) meritocracy in the United States has never 
           been a static concept; it has always existed within the context of legal, gender and 
           immigrant status, access to capital and education, and the level of equal 
           enforcement of the law; (g) the principals of liberty and equality, as embodied in 
           the United States Constitution and subsequent legislation and court decisions, 
           have always been defined as a series of compromises between states of large and 
           small populations, between competing economic systems, between state and 
           federal sovereignties, and between individual and collective rights.	
         6.  Believes that teachers of history, civics, U.S. government and politics who chose 
           to discuss current controversial issues of public policy or social affairs in the 
           classroom, should strive to explore such issues from diverse and contending 
           perspectives that are evidence based.
