                 ending  on May 20, 2022.   Pursuant to Section 206, subdivision (c)(6) of the  Procedures and  
                 Standing Orders  of the Board of Governors,  only  comments received during the  15-day  
                 comment period  that relate to the changes made  to the text of the regulation following  
                 the 45-day  comment  period will be addressed.  The Chancellor’s Office thanks  all the  
                 commenters for their submissions.

                          COMMUNITY COLLEGE INDEPENDENTS (CCCI) 
                 Messrs. Kaljumagi,  Mahler,  and  Michels submitted a joint letter dated  March 16,  2022,  
                 which p  rovided, in  relevant part, the following  comments:  
                      •   “We are writing to  express serious  concerns  over proposed regulatory action 
                          amending  Title 5 of the California Code of Regulations related to the evaluation 
                          and tenure  review  of community  college district employees and request immediate 
                          changes  in  the proposal.   Most  significantly, as written, the proposal would 
                          inappropriately and illegally  interfere with  local collective bargaining rights by 
                          imposing  new evaluation criteria ‘identified by the  Chancellor.’” 
                              •  Chancellor’s Office Response:   The Chancellor’s Office respectfully 
                                  disagrees with this comment.   The  Chancellor’s Office  is acting well  within 
                                  its “full authority to adopt rules and regulations necessary and proper to 
                                  execute  the functions specified in this section  as well as other  functions that 
                                  the board of governors is expressly authorized  by statute  to regulate.  (Ed. 
                                  Code, sec.  70901, subd. (c).) These functions  include,  in relevant part: 
                 1                                                                                                           A11Y 5/24/22
                                       Establishing minimum standards for  employment of college district 
                                       employees;  
                                  (Ed. Code, sec. 70901, subd. (b)(1)(B).).  Further specific authority  for the 
                                  contemplated action is provided  by Education Code  section 87626, which  
                                  provides:  
                                       Rules and regulations adopted  in  relation to the  evaluation process shall  
                                       assure that the standards and  procedures of the  evaluation process in  
                                       each district will be  fair and  in accordance with the intent of this act  and  
                                       that the evaluation  processes of  all  of the districts are basically similar  in  
                                       substance  and intent.  These regulations shall permit and encourage a 
                                       district governing board to establish evaluation procedures  and  
                                       standards which meet the  particular needs of that district. (emphasis 
                                       added)  
                              As the above-quoted  language makes clear, the  Board of  Governors is required  
                              to  ensure  that evaluation processes across the system are  “basically similar in  
                              substance  and intent.”   Finally, as the language also makes  clear, local 
                              governing  boards may “establish  evaluation  procedures and standards which 
                              meet the particular  needs of that district.”   Nothing  in the proposed  regulations  
                              infringes  on a local districts’  prerogative  to  establish such procedures through  
                              the  collective bargaining  process with their labor  partners.  With respect to the  
                              specific claim that the regulations would interfere with collective bargaining  
                              rights, we respectfully  disagree with that premise.   Given  that the regulatory  
                              language  instructs districts to adopt local policies upon  adoption by the Board  
                              of  Governors, and  given that evaluation procedures are  a negotiable subject,  it  
                              follows that this language  contemplates that  local  districts would begin the 
                              bargaining  process upon adoption  of these regulations.  Moreover,  there is  
                              generally a  lag time  of  at least a few months between Board approval of a  
                              regulation,  and its effective date,  owing to Department  of Finance review and  
                              the filing  requirement with  the Secretary  of State.  In addition, section 52010,  of  
                              title  5, provides a  180-day implementation period  for local policies  following  
                              the effective date of a  newly adopted  regulations.  This anticipated delay  would 
                              give local  districts time to begin the  bargaining  process with their labor  
                              partners upon adoption by  the Board.  
                      •   “The  proposed additions to subchapter  5 of Chapter  4 of Division 6 of Title 5 of the 
                          California Code of R  egulations  are inconsistent  with EERA  and Ed. Code.  They 
                          include: a)  The Chancellor shall adopt a publish a guidance describing DEIA 
                          competencies and  criteria in  collaboration with system stakeholder  groups, and b) 
                          The DEIA competencies and criteria identified by the Chancellor  shall be utilized in 
                 2
                               community college district performance evaluations of  employees and faculty  
                               tenure reviews as specified  in this  subchapter. But the  procedures for faculty  
                               evaluations (including  the  identification and  enumeration  of evaluation criteria)  
                               are  specifically enumerated  as a subject for mandatory bargaining (Gov. Code  
                               3543.2). Ed. Code 87619.1 and 87663 confirm  the  EERA’s  requirement that  
                               evaluation procedures ar            e negotiable.”  
                                    •    Chancellor’s Office Response:  It is unclear  why the  commenters  believe  
                                         that the proposed regulations are  inconsistent with  EERA.  The Chancellor’s  
                                         Office agrees that any  changes to  the procedures for performing employee  
                                         evaluations and tenure reviews necessitated  by these regulations will be  
                                         subject to  negotiations at the local level.  The  Board  of  Governors is not a  
                                         public  school employer  subject to the  duty  to bargain under EERA,  so it is 
                                         free to  enact regulations that will  implicate the duty to bargain at the local  
                                         level without itself  having to bargain  over  its  actions.   This regulatory action  
                                         is designed to allow for  local implementation through the  adoption  of  
                                         policies by local governing boards,  in keeping  with the  community  colleges 
                                         local  governance model.  The proposed regulatory action  expressly  
                                                                      
                                         contemplates local policy adoption which would undoubtedly include 
                                         collective bargaining at the local level.   Nothing  in the  proposed regulations 
                                         precludes local bargaining.  
                          •    “The  proposed regulatory action m                 akes no m      ention o  f collective bargaining rights  
                               at all.   Nor  does the  collaboration  with ‘system stakeholder groups’ described as 
                               part of the process  for developing evaluation criteria  appear  to include  union 
                               representation.”  Further, the  letter characterizes this process as “an  inappropriate  
                               usurpation  of collective bargaining rights....”  
                                    •    Chancellor’s Office Response:   While it is true that the  proposed  
                                         regulations do not explicitly mention collective bargaining, such mention is  
                                         not necessary to  trigger the public school employers’ duty to bargain.  As 
                                         the letter points out,  the duty to  bargain  arises from the  Educational  
                                         Employment  Relations Act (EERA),  Government Code section 3540 et seq.  It  
                                         requires a public school employers, which includes community college  
                                         districts, to  negotiate with an exclusive  representative over  hours, wages,  
                                         and other terms and conditions  of employment.   Whether the duty  to  
                                         bargain is i  mplicated does not depend on  whether  the  Board of Governors 
                                         or the  Chancellor’s Office  says it does.  In  fact, this is within the  Public  
                                         Employment Relations Board’s exclusive jurisdiction  to determine  rights  
                                         under  EERA.  (See Govt. Code §  3541.3,  subd. (b);  Public Employment  
                                         Relations Bd. v. Modesto City  Schools Dist.  (1982) 136 Cal.App.3d 881,  894.)   
                     3
                                                Contrary to the  assertion alleging  that these regulations constitute  a 
                                                “usurpation  of collective bargaining rights,”  these regulations in fact leave 
                                                much of the  implementation  of its prescriptions to the  local  process,  
                                                including collective bargaining where appropriate.  
                              •     The commenters further state that they  “strongly believe  that the proposed  
                                    regulatory  changes should be amended to clarify that the criteria  identified by  the  
                                    chancellor  should be provided to local districts to help  guide and inform local  
                                    bargaining  units and that local units shall have the responsibility and authority  to  
                                    determine the best way to  incorporate  an increased focus on DEIA and  anti-racist  
                                    principles into evaluation and tenure-review procedures.  
                                          •     Chancellor’s Office Response:  The Chancellor’s Office agrees with thi                                                     s  
                                                suggestion  and has incorporated  it into the revised proposed regulatory  
                                                text currently before  the Board  of Governors.  It is reflected  in section 53601,  
                                                                                                                                     
                                                subdivision (b), which has been revised to read:  “The DEIA competencies 
                                                and criteria identified  by the  Chancellor  shall be used as a reference for  
                                                locally-developed minimum standards  in community  college district  
                                                performance evaluations of employees and  faculty tenure reviews.”  
                              •     Finally, the  commenters list a number  of specific  changes they recommend be  
                                    made  to particular sections of the regulations.   These will be listed  below with 
                                    responses:  
                              •     “Section 52510 (h)  defines “cultural competency” by referring  to “specific  bodies  of 
                                    cultural knowledge,”  but fails to  specify what those  bodies of  cultural knowledge  
                                    are  or  include. Again, a reference to discussions in local  faculty  senates and in 
                                    collective bargaining would seem useful here.”  
                                          •     Chancellor’s Office Response:   The Chancellor’s Office agrees that  
                                                reference to “specific  bodies  of cultural  knowledge” should be changed to 
                                                “developing cultural knowledge”  to  emphasize that cultural knowledge is  
                                                difficult to  specify and relevant cultural knowledge may  differ based on  the  
                                                composition of the student body.   With respect to referencing discussion in 
                                                local senates and  collective bargaining, we  do  not believe that reference 
                                                would be appropriate  in a  definition and will  decline to incorporate  it.  
                              •     Section 53400 proposes to cut language that  is helpful  for readers of Title  5  
                                    regulations that are  not trained  in  law and regulations; we recommend  that this  
                                    language be kept.”  
                                          •     Chancellor’s Office Response:   We  do not  believe this is necessary because  
                                                the text is duplicative  of the authority  cited below the regulation,  and  for  
                        4
                                                this reason, and  for the sake of clarity,  declines to  incorporate the  
                                                suggested change.  
                              •     “Section 53401 seems to suggest that all  non-credit community  service courses are 
                                    taught by contractors,  which is not true.  Sometimes these courses are taught by  
                                    district employees, and these  employees should  not be excluded  from compliance  
                                    with these regulations.”  
                                          •     Chancellor’s Office Response:   We  appreciate the  commenters input and  
                                                suggestion  in this regard.   We have revised  the language  in section 53401 to 
                                                further clarify that instructors  of the  covered  classes, while exempt from 
                                                other minimum qualifications requirements of the chapter, are  not exempt  
                                                from the DEIA requirements to be adopted in  this regulatory action.  
                              •     “Section 53403 seems to  inappropriately  narrow the guarantee that the  original  
                                    language provided by  limiting the  protection  to  faculty  qualifications “in their  
                                                                                                                                                                                   
                                    current position” rather than the original protection, which stipulated that faculty 
                                    would continue  to  meet minimum qualifications for  any area where they met 
                                    minimum qualifications at the time they were hired (even if qualifications change  
                                    at a later date).  Since this has nothing  to do with DEIA and has not been discussed  
                                    as an intended consequence of the  proposed  changes, we suggest keeping  the  
                                    original language and  not making any  changes here.”  
                                          •     Chancellor’s Office Response:   The Chancellor’s Office has amended  the  
                                                proposed regulatory  action to remove these clarifying amendments and  
                                                intends  to revisit this in  the future.  
                              •     “Sections 53601 (b) and 53602 (a)  should,  again, make reference to the role  of local  
                                    collective bargaining.”  
                                          •     Chancellor’s Office Response:  As previously explained above,  because the  
                                                duty to bargain is  an independent obligation arising  from EERA, we do not  
                                                believe it is necessary  to include  reference to  it in these regulations.  
                              •     “Section 53602 (c) should  include  language referring to t  he  importance  of training  
                                    and professional development,  including  training  for evaluators.”

                                                regard.  Although we decline to add the requested  language here,  it may be  
                                                an appropriate topic  for regulatory amendments relating to the flex

                              •     “Section 53605 (a) should  not reference “curriculum” since calling  for anti-racist 
                                    curriculum  in some areas (welding, for  example) may seem confusing and vague.”

                                         Subdivision (a) was amended to reference professional  practices and omit 
                                         “curriculum” to broaden this subdivision’s  applicability to non-instructional  
                                         staff such as counselors and librarians who  could have been excluded from

                     2.        MATTHEW GARRETT, PROFESSOR OF HISTORY AND ETHNIC 
                               STUDIES, BAKERSFIELD COLLEGE  
                     On  March 18,  2022,  Mr. Garrett,  in  his personal capacity, submitted comments via email.   
                     Mr.  Garrett’s comments,  in relevant part, are  summarized below:  
                          •    Mr.  Garrett comments indicated that he believes the adoption of  these  Evaluation  
                               and Tenure Review regulations will increase the legal liability  of the California 
                               Community Colleges.   He further  asserts that “the state  simply cannot compel  
                               faculty to  echo (and  certainly  not ‘promote’) socio-political postures” and that the  
                               adoption  of these regulations would invite a “deluge  of  First Amendment lawsuits 
                               that will…  erode  educational resources  for students” and infringe  on “  California  
                               citizens’ freedom of c  onscience to resist a socio-political  posture that Californians 
                               widely rejected  in the  most recent election (Proposition 16).”  Mr.  Garrett further  
                               contends that “[i]t is undeniable  that racial equity is widely  contested, and yet this 
                               proposal would  obligate  faculty to affirm one side  of that socio-political value.”  
                               Mr.  Garrett then provides what appears to be  a legal  analysis of  court decisions on  
                               compelled  speech and closes by  asserting that these regulations would be struck  
                               down by  the courts and requesting  that the  Board of Governors not adopt the  
                               regulations.  
                                    •    Chancellor’s Office Response.  The Chancellor’s Office  thanks M  r. Garrett 
                                         for his comments but respectfully  disagrees with his comments and  
                                         analysis.   The proposed regulations would  not amount  to “compelled  
                                         speech” by  employees.  These revisions would simply enshrine  DEIA values  
                                         in the evaluation and tenure review processes.   We disagree with Mr.  
                                         Garrett’s analysis of  First Amendment case  law, finding  it inapposite  as the  
                                         cases  cited do not involve  issues  of academic freedom and free speech  in  
                                         the  context of institutions  of higher education prescribing  curriculum.  In 
                                         that sphere, courts have held  that a university can  “make  content-based  
                                         decisions when shaping its curriculum.” (Edwards v.  California University  of 
                                         Pennsylvania (3rd Cir.  1998)  156 F.3d 488, 492.)  Indeed,  the  Edwards court  
                                         stated that “case law from the Supreme Court and this court on academic 
                                                                                                                                                     
                                         freedom and the First Amendment compel the conclusion that Edwards

                                                materials in contravention of  the  University’s dictates.” (Id.)   At least one  
                                                California federal court has cited Edwards ap                                 provingly,  stating that 
                                                “[t]eachers and professors do  not have a First Amendment right  to choose  
                                                their  own curriculum materials, if it goes against a un                                     iversity’s

                              •     Mr. Garrett closes w               ith the following appeal:  “Please do not deny  faculty our First 
                                    Amendment rights.  Please do  not rob our students of educational resources.  
                                    Please do  not mandate a campus culture  that is hostile  to  intellectual diversity.

                                    adopt the proposed  changes  to Title V.”

                                                    sagrees with Mr. Garrett’s implication that the proposed regulations 
                                                would do any  of the things he  lists.

                        Dr.  Gebru submitted the  following comment to the Board of  Governors for their meeting  
                        on March  21, 2022:  
                              •     “On Behalf of the A2MEND  Organization, I would like to express my support in favor  
                                    of local and state level  system changes that will advance  the  outcomes of our  
                                    marginalized populations of students, specifically in  favor  of increasing success for  
                                    our African  American  male  students. It is necessary that our system continually  
                                    commit  to serving  our students be                         tter on our campuses and in our communities,  
                                    but most importantly  inside  of the classroom where they  feel  connected to their  
                                    educational journey and personal  success. It is necessary to include  DEIA  
                                    Competencies into professional  development opportunities  on each campus and  
                                    to be used  as baseline  criteria in which we evaluate the performance and  
                                    advancement of  our  faculty around these  competencies. As an  organization,  we 
                                    also stand  in  favor  of the approved set of regulatory changes to the  EEO template  
                                    and requirements focused  on the recruitment, hiring, and  promotion  process that 
                                    was passed last summer.  We will  continue to advocate  for these radical  changes in  
                                    our  system in order  to make a large-scale  impact and improve  the successes of our

                            THANKS DR.  GEBRU FOR THIS COMMENT.  
                   Dr. Barnes  submitted  comments to the Board of  Governors for their meeting on  March  21,  
                   2022, including  the following:  
                       •    “Well, I  fear that some  of  our colleges will  not be able to effectively  engage  or  
                            carryout the  faculty evaluation changes around DEIA as meaningfully  intended by  
                            the Board’s currently  written  and proposed  Title 5 changes.  Additionally,  it is 
                            worth reiterating, that the Board--before  moving  any proposed changes forward--
                            clearly understand and honor the current and differing  contexts  in  which colleges  
                            are  functioning currently around  RSJ and DEIA issues. The best intentions can  
                            create at best,  unintended  consequences, and  at worst, detrimental  or exact 
                            opposite  effects of our intentions. CFT  would like  to see the Board’s  efforts 
                            succeed on this very important issue, not just for  our  colleges,  but also  to our  
                            students,  our communities, and  society at large. I respectfully request that you  
                            give serious consideration the concerns outlined in  the  written  letter  offered  
                            collectively by the three union  Presidents and the verbal  comments of my union  
                                                                                                                                     
                            siblings. As Senior VP of CFT, I offer our efforts, and we stand ready, to assist in 
                            creating  effective and  meaningful changes for faculty  evaluation through the  
                            proper  channels around  DEIA.”

                   5.       WENYUAN  WU,  EXECUTIVE  DIRECTOR,  CALIFORNIANS  FOR EQUAL  
                            RIGHTS FOUNDATION  
                   On  March 21,  2022, Wenyuan Wu submitted a letter  on behalf of  the  Californians for  Equal  
                   Rights Foundation.  The comments are summarized below:  
                       •    Ms. Wu asserts that the proposed  regulatory  action  “pushes California Community  
                            Colleges, the  nation’s largest system of higher education, further  toward  
                            ideological indoctrination and thought conformity.”  
                                 •   Chancellor’s Office Response: The Chancellor’s  Office respectfully  
                                     disagrees with this statement.   The purpose of  the proposed regulations is 
                                     to  support student success an          d  retention  by creating inclusive, anti-racist 
                                     institutions, pedagogy, and curriculum that are reflective  of the system’s  
                                     diverse  student body.  
                       •    Ms. Wu further asserts that the “CCC Governing Board and the Chancellor’s Office 
                                                                                                                                        
                            have  narrow, politicized  conceptions  of diversity, inclusion and  equity.  By  
                            marrying DEIA with anti-racism, CCC  has fully subscribed to all major tenets of  
                   8
                               critical race theory (CRT),  including ‘intersectionality  of social identities,’  ‘multiple  
                               axes of  oppression,’  ‘minoritize(d) subordination,’ and  ‘equitable student 
                               outcomes.’  Anti-racism aggressively advocates  for discrimination in the  name  of  
                               equity and  race-based nonsolutions that assault our founding  principle of equality  
                               and our long-standing value of meritocracy.   The  proposed  changes are illiberal  
                               and  toxic,  serving only to further  inflame racial divisions and cover  up real  
                               problems in  our  education system.”  
                                    •    Chancellor’s Office Response:  Again, the Chancellor’s Office respectfully  
                                         disagrees with these statements.   As stated above, the purpose  of the  
                                         proposed regulations is to support student success and  retention  by  
                                         creating inclusive, anti-racist institutions, pedagogy,  and curriculum that 
                                         are reflective  of the system’s diverse student body. The Board  of  Governors 
                                         and the Chancellor’s Office expect that these regulations will be  
                                         implemented  in conformity with applicable law, including  but not limited  
                                         to, state and federal  anti-discrimination laws and regulations.  
                          •    Ms. Wu further asserts that the proposed regulations “would gravely jeopardize  
                               academic freedom  for CCC’s over 57,000  academic staff  and chill  free speech  on 
                                                                                                                                                   
                               CCC campuses.” She further contends that “[i]n addition to mandating DEIA as a 
                               minimum standard  for employee  performance review, the plan would also 
                               empower  education bureaucrats to thought-police college professors through  
                               ensuring  ‘a uniform understanding  of how  to evaluate’ and developing a 
                               comprehensive process for all local boards.”  
                                    •    Chancellor’s Office Response:  Again, the Chancellor’s Office disagrees 
                                         with these  assertions.  Nothing  in  the proposed regulations will impact 
                                         academic freedom.  Indeed, the Academic Senate for California Community  
                                         Colleges has been an  important partner in  the development of  these  
                                         regulations.  Finally, as to the creation of  a uniform understanding  of how to  
                                         evaluate and develop a comprehensive  process for all  local boards,  as we  
                                         have  explained before, the Board  of  Governors would simply be  following  
                                         the strictures of the Legislature, who  in enacting  Education Code section  
                                         87626,  provided that evaluation  processes throughout the system should be  
                                         “basically  similar  in substance and intent.”   However, also  consistent with 
                                                                                                                                                       
                                         section 87626, these regulations leave many of the specific aspects of local 
                                         implementation to the local consultation and/or bargaining processes,  
                                         which the Chancellor’s Office expects will be consistent with the  needs of 
                                         the local  community.

                            CHAIR, WOODLAND COMMUNITY COLLEGE  
                   Nili Kirschner submitted the following  comment on A  pril 8, 2022:  
                       •    “I am writing to share  my strong support for the proposed changes regarding  
                            evaluation and  tenure review  regulations.  As a tenured faculty member,  I have  
                            often lamented the shallowness of  our  current evaluation process for tenured  and  
                            tenure-track faculty.  The proposed emphasis on  Diversity, Equity, Inclusion, and 
                            Accessibility (DEIA) is essential to  close our system's achievement gaps and  follow  
                            our  Vision for Success  and Call to Action for antiracism. For too long  faculty have  
                            relied on  the concept of academic  freedom to avoid making  changes. We must  not  
                            conflate academic freedom and discipline  expertise with holding  ourselves and our  
                            system to  the highest standards.  Recently, COVID  forced many  faculty to teach 
                            online, pushing  some out of their comfort zone - and yet, we  still hold faculty to  
                            high standards for  Distance  Education. Being  out  of one's comfort zone is no  
                            excuse  not  to  do the work to  serve students.  The same should be true  for the vital  
                            work in DEIA.  We  cannot  let some  people's discomfort with change or  with the  
                            unfamiliar  be an  excuse to maintain a status quo that is  unquestionably  
                            inequitable  in its outcomes for our  students. The California Community  College  
                            must primarily  orient  itself to meeting students'  needs, not  faculty  comfort. Saying  
                            that faculty  must consider DEIA i  n developing and  presenting curriculum does not 
                            take  away academic  freedom,  it simply reminds us that we cannot remain  
                            complacent in the face of grave inequities.”  
                                 •   Chancellor’s Office Response:  The Chancellor’s Office  thanks Ms. Kirschner  
                                     for this comment.  
                   7.       BETSY ALLEN, INSTRUCTIONAL DESIGN RESOURCE FACULTY,  
                            WOODLAND  COMMUNITY COLLEGE  
                   Ms.  Allen submitted the following comment  to the Chancellor’s  Office on April 11, 2022:  
                       •    “I write in support  of the proposed changes  to Title 5, that would amend the  
                            California Code of Regulations  to include  diversity, equity,  inclusion, and  
                            accessibility as criteria for  evaluating  employee  performance and in tenure review.   
                            As the California Community  College system takes action  in addressing systemic  
                            racism in its institutions, ensuring that both staff and faculty are accountable for  
                            continually  learning and implementing equitable  practices in their teaching  and  
                            work is a critical  step  toward  real and  sustainable change. These proposed  
                            changes to  Title 5 tie student outcomes to  faculty and staff practice,  at the levels of  
                            policy and  funding, teaching and  learning, and enrollment and support. Anchoring

                               this  cultural shift  in the DEIA competencies  framework (§ 53601.) will provide  
                               research-based guidance in how to implement equitable  practice into all  aspects  
                               of CCC institutions, allowing us to measure  our progress as districts, colleges, and  
                               individuals.  I am especially pleased with the  proposed status of districts in  
                               ensuring institutional  commitment to DEIA (§ 53602.),  including the  offering of 
                               professional development opportunities  in DEIA and requiring  “self-reflection and  
                               a comprehensive evaluation  from appropriate evaluators […] to  demonstrate their  
                               understanding  of DEIA  and anti-racist principles” ((c) (6)).”

                     8.        A CALIFORNIA CITIZEN WITH STRONG INTEREST IN THE CALIFORNIA 
                               COMMUNITY COLLEGES  
                     An anonymous commenter submitted  comments to  the Chancellor’s Office on April 21,  
                     2022, which are summarized as follows:  
                          •    “I have some serious concerns about statewide control and regulation that could  
                               be too strict regarding  DEIA, harming  students and  faculty instead  of  helping  DEIA 
                               efforts. In general, the proposed  changes to  Title  5 regarding diversity, equity, and 
                               inclusion could be  interpreted as the  imposition of a specific viewpoint of these  
                               topics by the state  in  conflict with academic freedom of  community college  faculty  
                               seeking truth in teaching  and learning. For  example, there are very  specific 
                               definitions of v  ocabulary  terms proposed for subchapter  1 of chapter  4 of division  
                               6, 52510 definitions,  and these  definitions  might  still  be reasonably debated by  
                               faculty, administrators, and students in good faith. In  other words, there  is still not  
                               necessarily consensus among  all California residents, or even  a majority  viewpoint,  
                               on the definitions of these vocabulary terms.”  
                                    •    Chancellor’s Office Response: Because this  comment  does not reference  
                                         any specific text,  or  provision  of the proposed  regulations that the  
                                         commenter claims would  impose a specific viewpoint, the Chancellor’s  
                                         Office  cannot provide a  meaningful  specific  response to the concerns  
                                         expressed  in this  comment.   However, in general, academic freedom is not  
                                         curtailed when the Board of  Governors exercises its lawful authority to  
                                         establish “minimum standards for the  employment of academic and  
                                         administrative staff in  community colleges.” (Ed. Code,  sec. 70901, subd.  
                                         (b)(1)(B).).  
                          •    “Developing a set of statewide DEIA competencies and  criteria by the state  
                               chancellor's office, as proposed for subchapter 5 and 7 of chapter 4 of division 6, 
                                                                                                                                                     
                               53601 (a),  may in  fact decrease pedagogical  diversity by imposing  a single  
                     11
                               perspective and a single approach  for diversity, equity, and  inclusion in the  
                               classroom.  The recommendation  to  include representative stakeholders in the  
                               process of  developing  the statewide DEIA competencies, while appearing to be fair  
                               on the surface, might  end up excluding the conservative, centrist, and  moderate 
                               political viewpoints of  stakeholders who  fear  the very real and severe social  
                               consequences  (including demotion, job loss, and  public ridicule  on social  media)  of 
                               speaking up and sharing  their views. I am not including  my name  or city  on this 
                               letter for this very reason.”

                                         grounded  in specific facts or  observations.   As such, the Chancellor’s Office

                               teaching effectiveness in classrooms with diverse  groups of students because the  
                               statewide competencies might be too strict and  inflexible to meet the  needs of the  
                               students in  a specific district,  college, or  classroom.”   The commenter further  
                               states, “.  Imposing statewide DEIA competencies could  reduce the  ability  of  faculty  
                               to respond  compassionately,  creatively, and  quickly to changing  circumstances in  
                               the  classroom.  Faculty could feel pressured  to  conform to the statewide  
                               competencies over responding to actual student needs  if there was  conflict  
                               between the two priorities.”  
                                    •    Chancellor’s Office Response: As with the previous comment, this 
                                         comment is  speculative  and not grounded in specific  facts  or  observations.   
                                         As such, the Chancellor’s Office  cannot provide a meaningful specific  
                                         response to the concerns expressed in  this comment.  
                          •    The commenter concludes her  comments by  stating,  “In  conclusion, please allow  
                               much more time to  get more  input, especially  anonymous input,  from all  faculty  
                               around the  state. So much work  is  already being  done to  foster  appreciation of  
                               diversity, lift up students who have experienced  disadvantages, and prioritize a  
                               welcoming  campus climate at CA  colleges,  especially with the strong support of  
                               the  CA Academic Senate.  Local control (at the district and college levels)  is  
                               preferable  to state  control  of these DEIA  activities due to the  flexibility and  
                               diversity of  pedagogical approach that can be  achieved.”  
                                    •    Chancellor’s Office Response: The  Chancellor’s Office thanks the  
                                         commenter for their comment;  however, the consensus view of  the various 
                                         stakeholders in the  California Community  Colleges was that there  is no time

                                     that local  control will  be lost in  this area, we  respectfully disagree  because  
                                     local  districts will still  be able  to establish evaluation and tenure review  
                                     policies in  consultation with their  local stakeholder groups.  
                   9.       JOE COHN, LEGISLATIVE AND  POLICY DIRECTOR, FOUNDATION FOR  
                            INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS IN EDUCATION (FIRE)  
                   Mr. Cohn  submitted a letter  to  the Chancellor’s Office on April  22, 2022, containing a 
                   number of  comments, which  are summarized as follows:  
                       •    Mr.  Cohn’s primary  assertion  is that “[t]he proposed revisions to regulations 
                            governing faculty evaluation  and tenure review would violate the First Amendment 
                            rights of  California Community  Colleges (CCC) faculty by compelling them to  
                            endorse specific views related to  diversity,  equity,  inclusion, and  accessibility  
                            (DEIA). The Board of Governors cannot  require colleges  in  the  CCC system to  
                            penalize  faculty members based  on their refusal to  endorse particular  ideological  
                            views or to  incorporate those views into their  academic  work.”  Mr.  Cohn’s letter  
                            provides his analysis of First Amendment law and academic  freedom in the context  
                            of higher education and  concludes that  “the proposed regulations would  
                            transgress these constitutional  principles by requiring faculty members to affirm 
                            certain perspectives on disputed  political and ideological  issues and to embed  
                            those perspectives  in their academic activities.  This violates faculty members’  
                            freedom to dissent  from the prevailing  consensus  on issues  of public  or academic  
                            concern without suffering  diminishing  career prospects.”  
                                 •   Chancellor’s Office Response: The Chancellor’s Office appreciates M  r.  
                                     Cohn’s submission, but respectfully disagrees with Mr. Cohn’s  
                                     characterization of the regulations and his analysis of  their  
                                     constitutionality.  It appears that Mr. Cohn’s analysis,  while grounded  in 
                                     some First Amendment cases involving  higher  education, does not include  
                                     cases that  deal with the specific  subject of  speech  in the  instructional  
                                     setting.  
                                     Academic  freedom is a concept that protects faculty members from reprisal  
                                     by their  community  college district employer, to  the extent the employer  
                                     has a policy or  collective bargaining agreement codifying  those protections.   
                                     Neither  the Board of Governors nor  the Chancellor’s Office  stands in  an  
                                     employment relationship with faculty (unlike  UC  and CSU), accordingly the  
                                     concept  of  academic  freedom is not applicable to the regulations of the  
                                     Board of Governors that are  adopted in furtherance of its mandate of  
                   13
                                                 “[e]stablishing minimum standards for  employment of college  district 
                                                 employees.” (Ed. Code, sec.  70901, subd. (b)(1).).  
                                                 Moreover,  academic freedom is not abso                               lute.  Courts have  held that a 
                                                 university can “make content-based decisions when shaping  its curriculum” 
                                                 (Edwards v. California  University  of  Pennsylvania (3rd  Cir. 1998)  156 F.3d  
                                                 488,  492 [upholding public university  decision to prohibit use of “doctrinaire  
                                                 religious materials”].)   Indeed, the Edwards court stated  that “case  law from 
                                                 the Supreme Court and this court  on academic  freedom and  the  First

                                                 a  constitutional  right t  o choose curriculum materials in contravention of  the  
                                                 University’s dictates.” (Id.)   At least one California federal  court has cited  
                                                 Edwards approvingly, stating  that “[t]eachers and professors do  not have a 
                                                 First Amendment right to  choose their  own curriculum materials, if it goes 
                                                 against a university’s requirements.  (California T  eachers Ass’n v. Davis (C.D.  
                                                 Cal.  1999)  64 F.Supp.2d 945,  953.)  
                                                 Mr.  Cohn’s analysis overlooks the  fact that while the proposed regulations 
                                                 provide a  framework  for what local districts should  consider when  enacting  
                                                                                                                                                                    
                                                 evaluation and tenure review policies and procedures, what those policies 
                                                 and procedures ultimately require will  involve local districts and their  
                                                 employees.  Any issues involving First Amendment rights or academic 
                                                 freedom should be viewed through that lens and analyzed under  the 
                                                 Connick v.  Myers framework.  
                               •     Mr.  Cohn’s letter continues to attempt to make the case that “the First Amendment  
                                     and principles of academic  freedom protect  faculty members’ right to discuss 
                                     these ideas and to take any  position  on them.   CCC may  not grant itself the  
                                     authority to declare this debate  settled, leaving  its faculty  no choice  but to affirm 
                                     one  narrow perspective.”  Mr. Cohn further posits that the proposed regulations  
                                     equate to the  California Community Colleges “demanding rigid  ideological  
                                     conformity  on  issues of public and  academic  debate” which would “shrink the  
                                     universe of ideas that can  be  studied or expressed on its campuses….”  
                                     Mr. Cohn  concludes by stating, “FIRE  recognizes that CCC may shape  and express 
                                     its own values as an  institution,  including  promoting  DEIA and the diversification  of  
                                     its faculty and  student  body, and act on those  values within the bounds of the law.  
                                     CCC must also,  of course,  ensure its educational environment  is  free from unlawful  
                                     discriminatory conduct. What  CCC may  not do, however,  is prescribe  an orthodox 
                                     political or ideological position  that restricts faculty  members’ opportunities for  
                                     advancement—including the awarding of  tenure—or prevents the hiring  of those  
                                     who hold dissenting views.”  
                        14
                                    •    Chancellor’s Office Response: The Chancellor’s  Office respectfully  
                                         disagrees with Mr. Cohn’s characterization  of what the proposed  
                                         regulations would require of  faculty.   Rather  than  prescribe a specific and 
                                         rigid  ideology that must be  imparted  on students. The proposed regulations 
                                         simply  provide  an overall framework on just one  aspect related  to DEIA that 
                                         should be part of  local  districts’  evaluation and tenure review  processes,  
                                         which as mentioned above, will ultimately be  negotiated at the  local district  
                                         level and will likely  look different  at each  of the system’s 73 community  
                                         college districts.  
                                         Indeed,  in the words of Mr. Cohn himself, through this regulatory action, the  
                                         Board of Governors,  on behalf of the California Community College system,  
                                         would be “shap[ing] its own values as an  institution,  including  promoting  
                                         DEIA and the diversification of its faculty and  student body, and  [will] act on  
                                                                                                                                                    
                                         those values within the bounds of the law.”  This regulatory action is not, 
                                         and will  not “prescribe  an orthodox political  or ideological position that  
                                         restricts faculty  members’ opportunities for advancement….”  
                     10.       ETHAN BLEVINS, ATTORNEY, PACIFIC LEGAL FOUNDATION  (PLF)  
                     Mr. Blevins submitted  a letter to the  Chancellor’s Office  on April 22,  2022, containing a  
                     number  of  comments  in general  opposition to the proposed regulations.  The relevant  
                     comments are summarized as follows:  
                          •    Mr. Blevins indicates in his letter that the  PLF  “opposes the growing  trend among  
                               universities and colleges to require adherence to  ideological tenets such as anti-
                               racism as a condition in the hiring, retention,  and promotion of  faculty. Such 
                               demands share an unsettling resemblance to  the unconstitutional  loyalty oaths 
                               required by California  universities in the  1950s.  The proposed regulation will 
                               entrench  a political orthodoxy,  reduce intellectual  diversity on college campuses,  
                               threaten First Amendment freedoms, and  impair  the education  of students who  
                               deserve  exposure to a  rich and robust range  of viewpoints on the  critical  issues 
                               facing  our country. In the words of the  Supreme  Court in striking down a law  
                               compelling  a classroom flag salute:  ‘If there  is any fixed  star in  our constitutional  
                               constellation, it is that no official,  high or petty,  can  prescribe what shall be  
                               orthodox in politics, nationalism, religion, or  other matters  of opinion.’  (footnote  
                               omitted)  The proposed regulation would prescribe  just such an orthodoxy.”  
                                    •    Chancellor’s Office Response:  The  Chancellor’s Office thanks Mr. Blevins  
                                         for sharing  the  PLF’s concerns with respect to this regulatory action,  but 
                                         respectfully disagrees with the  characterization  of this work.  
                     15
                              •     The remainder  of  Mr. Blevins’s letter  is a treatise on why  PLF  opposes the  
                                    regulatory  action.  Among  other things, he asserts that it will  “result in greater  
                                    political and ideological uniformity among community  college  employees” and  
                                    that it is “not neutral with respect to  viewpoint—it will give strong preference to 
                                    faculty who agree with and actively promote  a specific political and  philosophical  
                                    vision regarding  some  of the most controversial topics  of our  day.   Mr. Blevins adds  
                                    that “[t]he regulation will likewise  disfavor those employees and  job applicants 
                                    with an alternative viewpoint.”  
                                          •     Chancellor’s Office Response:  The  Chancellor’s  Office respectfully  
                                                disagrees with these  characterizations.  These  assertions  are highly  
                                                speculative and point to  no evidence  that the  parade of  horribles it lists is 
                                                likely  to occur.  Nothing in  the regulatory language indicates that “strong  
                                                preference” will be given to “faculty who  agree with and  actively promote a 
                                                specific political and  philosophical vision…”   Finally,  Mr.  Blevins asserts  
                                                that the regulation will  disfavor  job applicants with an  “alternative view  
                                                point.”  It is unclear what this “alternative viewpoint” would be,  but 
                                                perhaps more importantly, the proposed regulations relate to the  
                                                                                                                          
                                                evaluations and tenure reviews of existing employees; accordingly, the 
                                                relevance of the regulations to  job applicants is also unclear.  
                              •     Mr. Blevins’s  letter  describes what is included in the  proposed regulations, but  
                                    veers into  speculative  territory  again  when,  in attempting to describe the concepts 
                                    of anti-racism and  DEIA, he posits that “a core  notion behind anti-racist thought is 
                                    that ‘[t]he  only remedy  to past discrimination is present  discrimination.’  (footnote  
                                    omitted)” Mr. Blevins asserts that “requiring  staff to  conform to such views [anti-
                                    racism] as  a condition of  employment ‘amounts to an  ideological litmus test.’  
                                    (footnote  omitted)”  The remainder  of the first part of  Mr. Blevins’ letter continues 
                                    along the same vein, alternately denouncing  some aspect of  DEIA and anti-racism 
                                    and then  immediately speculating  as to how the  California Community Colleges 
                                    may operationalize the concept to  the maximum  detriment of “staff holding  
                                    alternative viewpoints on a    variety  of important issues.”  Again,  Mr.  Blevins’  
                                    narrative  posits that a commitment to anti-racism will disfavor the  hiring  of any  
                                    number  of individuals  with disfavored views, such as those  criticizing  the 1619  
                                    project for example.  
                                          •     Chancellor’s Office Response:  The Chancellor’s Office again  respectfully  
                                                disagrees with these  characterizations.  Again, the regulations at issue  
                                                relate to the evaluation and tenure reviews of  existing  employees, so the 
                                                speculation as to how they might be used to  disfavor  job applicants is 
                                                inapposite.  
                        16
                              •     The second part of  Mr.  Blevins’ letter asserts that the  “proposed regulation  
                                    endangers  academic freedom and  free speech.”  As before, the entirety  of Mr.  
                                    Blevins arguments ar                 e  based on speculation  that the  “proposed regulation will  
                                    constrict teachers’ rights to express themselves freely  in  the  classroom.”  As a  
                                    result,  Mr.  Blevins speculates that the “regulation therefore likely violates the  First 
                                    Amendment’s guarantees of academic  freedom and freedom of speech.”   Again,  as 
                                    throughout his letter,  Mr. Blevins speculates as to the effect of the regulations,  
                                    positing that simply  because teachers may have to  incorporate  DEIA principles into  
                                    their teaching, it would impermissibly  chill the speech  of any  number  of different  
                                    types of  instructors.  Mr. Blevins also asserts that the terms “DEIA and  anti-racist 
                                    principles”  are vague and  lack  coherent meaning and assails a number  of the other  
                                    definitions  in section 52510 as unclear.   However, rather than  provide alternatives 
                                    for the Chancellor’s Office to  consider,  Mr. Blevins simply asserts that the lack  of  
                                    clarity will lead to yet more fear, self-censoring, and  distrust.  
                                          •     Chancellor’s Office Response:  The Chancellor’s Office again  respectfully  
                                                disagrees with these  characterizations.  Once the regulations are  
                                                implemented and operationalized at the local level, we do  not believe the 
                                                                                                                                                                                 
                                                parade of horribles Mr. Blevins conjures will materialize.  Furthermore, we 
                                                dispute Mr. Blevins’s analysis  of the First Amendment and  academic  
                                                freedom  concerns.  Finally, we do  not believe the applicable terms  are 
                                                unclear, but in any  event, Mr. Blevins provides no alternatives f  or us to  
                                                consider.  
                              •     The final  section  of  Mr.  Blevins’ letter asserts that the  proposed regulations will  
                                    impair students’  education because they will serve to reduce viewpoint diversity  
                                    rather than  promote  it.  Mr. Blevins makes these assertions without providing any  
                                    scholarly research in  support.  Rather, those  assertions  are based  on statements 
                                    made  by an Ivy League  President and  a political celebrity.  In conclusion,  Mr.  
                                    Blevins summarizes his arguments and urges the Board of  Governors to reject the  
                                    proposed regulation.  
                                          •     Chancellor’s Office Response:  The Chancellor’s Office again  respectfully  
                                                disagrees with Mr. Blevins’s characterizations.  In sum, Mr. Blevins’s  
                                                objections to the  proposed regulations appear based  on  hostility to  DEIA  
                                                principles and  speculation about what they  might bring.   We recommend  
                                                that the Board reject Mr. Blevin’s request and  approve the proposed  
                                                regulations.

                        11.         SHAARON VOGEL, PRESIDENT, BUTTE COLLEGE EDUCATORS  
                                    ASSOCIATION (BCEA)  
                        Shaaron  Vogel submitted a letter  on April 22,  2022  containing a number  of comments 
                        regarding specific  amendments to different sections  of the proposed regulations.   Each  
                        comment is summarized with responses below:  
                        In general,  Ms. Vogel and  the BCEA oppose the proposed regulatory changes.   While the  
                        letter  asserts that they “are NOT  in  opposition to  Diversity, Equity, Inclusion and  
                        Accessibility but rather to the intrusion into Academic Senate  10 plus 1 and labor  role.”   
                        Ms.  Vogel repeated that they “do  not oppose the  movement toward  teaching under  DEIA  
                        principles,  as they are  what is best for  our students and society.”   She  further  indicated  
                        that “Local  Districts should maintain the authority to approach this  change in  the way  
                        that works best for them.”  BCEA’s specific concerns were the following:  
                              •     Section  53403:   Ms. Vogel suggested the  Chancellor’s Office  “[a]dd the phrase  ‘or  
                                    discipline’ to the  end  of the revised sentence, to protect faculty's existing approval  
                                    in different faculty service areas.”  
                                          •     Chancellor’s Office Response: The  Chancellor’s Office thanks Ms. Vogel 
                                                                                                                                                                                  
                                                and BCEA for their recommendation, but declines to submit it to the Board 
                                                of  Governors for  consideration.  After further  consultation with stakeholder  
                                                groups, we  are withdrawing the proposed amended language  presented at  
                                                First Reading  at the Board’s March meeting.   This will  have the effect of  
                                                leaving the  language  of section 534                        03 unaltered from its current form.  
                              •     Section 53601(c):  With respect to section  53601, Ms.  Vogel states, “We have grave 
                                    concerns about  an evolving set  of  competencies/criteria that are not part of our  
                                    contract and that are  frequently changed. A primary principle  of performance  
                                    evaluations is that employees must have  notice  of the items that will be assessed.  
                                    If this  set of competencies/criteria  is  constantly under  construction,  it could create  
                                    a "gotcha" moment w  here the  employee is negatively evaluated for  something  
                                    they did not know  they were supposed to be  doing.  This will lead to  unnecessary  
                                    grievances  and will  cost both Districts and  labor unions time and  money. Also,  our  
                                    contracts govern evaluations,  and they  are  locally negotiated for each District.  
                                    Standardizing  evaluation competencies/criteria removes those  parties from their  
                                    role  in determining the terms of  local  contractual arrangements, and we  strongly  
                                    believe that this constitutes improper  interference into the bargaining  process.  
                                    Though subsection (a) refers to the competencies/criteria as a "  guidance", which 
                                    suggests authority still  resides at the local  level, subsection (b) states that they  
                                    "shall" be utilized, which suggests standardization across the CCC  system,  
                                    violating local  control..”  
                        18
                                    •    Chancellor’s Office Response:  The Chancellor’s Office appreciates B  CEA’s 
                                         perspective on this issue.  With respect to the  purported “interference  into 
                                         the bargaining process” and “violating  local control,” we  respectfully  
                                         disagree with those views.   To begin,  as we have specified in response to  
                                         prior comments, the  Chancellor’s Office is well within its authority to  
                                         regulate  in  the area of  “[e]stablishing minimum standards for  employment  
                                         of college  district employees.”  (Ed. Code,  sec.  70901, subd. (b)(1).)   To the  
                                         extent these regulations will trigger the duty  to bargain,  such an  obligation  
                                         rests with the local  community  college districts to  negotiate with their labor  
                                         partners.   Neither  the  Board of Governors nor  the Chancellor’s Office is a 
                                         “public school  employer” as defined by EERA, and as such, cannot be seen  
                                         to  “interfere” with the  bargaining  process simply by  enacting regulations  
                                         the Board  is empowered by the Legislature  to enact.   Moreover, BCEA’s  
                                         concern that the Board of  Governors’ regulations may violate local  control  
                                         is  likely mooted by revisions to the text  of section 53601 considered at First  
                                         Reading  that we are  now proposing  for Second  Reading.  As a result of  
                                         further consultation with system stakeholders, the Chancellor’s Office  
                                         recommends revising  the language  in subdivision (b) of section  53601 from 
                                         “utilized” to “used as  a reference  for locally  developed minimum  
                                         standards.”  The  effect  of this change  is to clarify that the  guidance  
                                         published by the  Chancellor’s Office pursuant  to subdivision (a) is to  be  just

                                         policies and procedures.  
                          •    Section 53602(a)  and (b):   With respect to this section of the proposed  
                               regulations, BCEA is concerned about purported vagueness the term  “proficiency”  
                               found  in subdivisions (b) and (c).   They  believe the term is undefined and these  
                               subdivisions do not specify how  “proficiency” should be measured.  BCEA asks, 
                               “What counts as ‘proficient’?  Two things that support DEIA? Three? Again, through 
                               the local  labor  negotiations process, each District and union representatives work  
                               these things out at the  bargaining  table when  they develop their  evaluation  
                               process and  instrument. Imposing a system wide, undefined standard like  
                               ‘proficiency’ interferes  with the ability  of n  egotiation teams to define expectations  
                               for represented  employees.”  
                                    •    Chancellor’s Office Response: The  Chancellor’s Office thanks BCEA for this 
                                         comment,  but respectfully disagrees that the term “proficiency”  is too  
                                         vague as used  in section  53602 to  be workable, as BCEA’s comment  implies.   
                                         In  our view, the  language  of subdivision (a) is clear in stating that “[d]istrict  
                                         governing  boards shall adopt policies for  the evaluation of  employee 
                                         performance,  including tenure reviews, that requires demonstrated,  or  
                     19
                                                progress toward, proficiency  in the DEIA competencies published by the  
                                                Chancellor.”   This language  assigns to local governing boards the obligation  
                                                to adopt policies for  evaluating employee performance  and tenure  reviews,  
                                                which will  include defining what  “proficiency” in the DEIA competencies  in  
                                                that district.   Contrary to BCEA’s assertion, this regulation  is not attempting  
                                                to impose a  system wide, undefined standard  of “proficiency.”  Rather, the  
                                                regulation leaves this determination to the  local  decision-making  process  
                                                for adopting such policies.  To  the extent that this decision-making  process 
                                                includes collective bargaining, the regulation would clearly  not interfere 
                                                with local negotiations, but rather  encourage  them.  In general, where the  
                                                regulations require community  college districts to adopt or  implement a 
                                                policy,  districts must go about that process in compliance with any  
                                                independent statutory requirements, such as collective bargaining  
                                                obligations.  Our  omission of any  applicable statutory requirements districts 
                                                must adhere to  in the language of  our regulations should  not be construed  
                                                as license  to  ignore those statutory requirements.   Rather, it is generally  
                                                because  it is unnecessary to restate those requirements in  each new  
                                                regulation promulgated by the Board of  Governors.  
                              •     Section 53602(c):   With respect to subdivision (c) of Section  53602, BCEA’s letter  
                                    asserts that, “While this proposed  revision  seems to support local control  in  
                                    subsection  (a) by  not requiring any certain  number  of the DEIA 
                                    competencies/criteria  to be used in evaluations, it suffers from a similar vagueness  
                                    problem in subsection (4) in  the phrase "significant emphasis".  This p  roposed  
                                    language creates a guessing  game  of how much is enough. Given the  variability  of  
                                    evaluation  instruments across the  CCC system, it should be left to local  
                                    negotiations processes to determine how to incorporate  DEIA competencies  into 
                                    their process.”  In  addition,  BCEA posits that “[a] top-down mandate  of an  
                                    undefined level  –  ‘significant’ that they must reach will be  inoperable and may  
                                    again lead  to needless grievances.”  
                                          •     Chancellor’s Office Response.   The  Chancellor’s Office thanks BCEA for  its 
                                                comment but respectfully disagrees that the  phrase  “significant emphasis”  
                                                is too vague to be workable as implied.  It appears that BCEA believes this 
                                                purported vagueness will  lead  to “needless grievances.”   However, it  is  
                                                unclear how this could be the case as grievances are  internal complaints  
                                                brought by  members  of a bargaining  unit when they allege the employer  
                                                has violated a provision  of a collective bargaining agreement.   Here,  
                                                subdivision (c)  of section  53602 deals with requirements imposed on 
                                                districts by  the Board  of Governors, so it  is unlikely  to be the basis of a local  
                                                grievance.  To the extent any ambiguity  in the language  becomes apparent

                                                 after enactment, the Chancellor’s  Office can  provide clarification through  
                                                 guidance documents.  
                               •     Section 53605(a).  Finally, BCEA asserts that “this section unacceptably  intrudes 
                                     into the academic freedom of teaching faculty by requiring  ("shall") faculty to  use  
                                     DEIA and anti-racist curricula. Faculty control the curriculum,  based on  their  
                                     disciplinary  expertise. They know best whether explicit  curricula will work  for their  
                                     subject matter,  or whether they can support/teach DEIA principles through  
                                     particular instructional methods or strategies (such as critical thinking  exercises 
                                     applied to existing, non-DEIA curricula). Moreover,  some subjects (e                                               .g., in CTE) may  
                                     not have that level of  control  over  their curriculum,  given existing certification 
                                     requirements.”  
                                           •     Chancellor’s Office Response.  Academic  freedom is a concept that  
                                                 protects faculty members from reprisal  by their community college district

                                                 agreement  codifying those protections.  Neither the Board of Governors nor  
                                                 the  Chancellor’s Office stands in an  employment relationship with faculty  
                                                 (unlike UC and CSU),  accordingly  the concept of academic freedom  is not  
                                                 applicable  to the regulations of the Board  of  Governors that are adopted in

                                                 employment of college district employees.” (Ed.  Code, sec. 70901, subd. 
                                                 (b)(1).)  
                                                 Moreover,  academic freedom is not abso                               lute.  Courts have  held that a 
                                                 university can “make content-based  decisions when shaping  its

                                                 against a  university’s requirements.  (California Teachers  Ass’n v. Davis  (C.D.

                                                 Chancellor’s Office believes that the regulatory action is respectful of

                                    ASSOCIATION  
                        Mr. Kaljumagi, as President of the California Community College Association (CCCA),  
                        submitted  a letter to the  Chancellor’s Office  on April 25,  2022, containing a number  of  
                        comments,  the most relevant of which are summarized as follows:  
                              •     “While  DEIA principles  are undoubtedly  critically important in California  
                                    classrooms and  campuses, the  proposed  regulatory changes ignore  the obligations 
                                    that community college districts have under the  Educational  Employment  
                                    Relations Act. If  implemented in  their current form,  the proposed regulations will  
                                    force districts to violate collective bargaining  law.  We  therefore urge  that the  
                                    regulations be reconsidered, to  take  into account community college districts’  
                                    obligations under  existing law.”  
                                          •     Chancellor’s Office Response: We agree with  and thank CCCA for  
                                                recognizing  the importance of implementing DEIA  principles  in the  
                                                California Community  Colleges.   However, we  disagree that these  
                                                regulations will  force districts to violate  collective bargaining law.  
                              •     In  its letter, CCCA explains that under  EERA, specifically,  Government Code section  
                                    3543.2, subdivision (a), “procedures to be used for the  evaluation of employees” 
                                    are within the scope of bargaining  and that a community  college district must 
                                    notify employees and negotiate changes to evaluation procedures prior  to 
                                    implementing  any  changes.  The  letter goes  on to cite relevant decisions  of the  
                                    Public  Employment Relations Board (PERB) finding public school employers liable  
                                    when they  have  changed  evaluation procedures without first negotiating with the  
                                    unions.  
                                          •     Chancellor’s Office Response:  We agree that any changes to  evaluation  
                                                procedures that may be  necessitated by the adoption  of these regulations  
                                                will be subject to bargaining between  community college districts and  their  
                                                affected labor partners.  
                              •     CCCA’s letter  further asserts that “the proposed regulations do  not account for the  
                                    fact that EERA requires community colleges to bargain  such changes with exclusive  
                                    representatives.   The proposed regulations, as currently  framed, will thus force  
                                    community college districts to run afoul of their legal  obligations.”  
                                          •     Chancellor’s Office Response: We respectfully disagree  with CCCA’s 
                                                characterization that the mere  adoption of  these regulations will force  
                                                districts to  violate  EERA.  It appears that CCCA views the  regulations as 
                                                being self-executing upon adoption and that changes to  evaluation  
                        22
                                                procedures will  occur  automatically by  operation of  law.  We view this 
                                                process differently.  Although the letter does  not identify the  specific  
                                                regulatory  language that would  purportedly  cause districts to violate  EERA,  
                                                we have surmised that it is likely subdivision (a) of section 53                                          602, which  
                                                provides:  “District governing boards shall adopt policies for the  evaluation  
                                                of employee performance,  including  tenure reviews...  etc.”  Given that the  
                                                regulatory  language instructs districts to adopt local policies upon  adoption  
                                                by the Board of  Governors,  and given that evaluation procedures are  a 
                                                negotiable subject, it follows that this language contemplates that local  
                                                districts would begin the bargaining  process upon adoption of these  
                                                regulations.   Moreover, there  is generally a lag time  of at least a few  months 
                                                between Board  approval of  a regulation, and its effective date, owing to  
                                                Department of  Finance review and the  filing requirement with the Secretary  
                                                of State.  This anticipated  delay would give local  districts time  to begin the  
                                                bargaining  process with their  labor partners upon adoption by the Board.   
                                                In addition, under  California Code  of Regulations, title  5,  section 52010,  
                                                community college districts have  180 days from a new regulation’s  effective  
                                                date  to align local  policies.  Accordingly, there  is time built into the  
                                                regulatory process  for implementation.  
                              •     The  letter concludes b  y  asserting that “[t]he inclusion of DEIA p  rinciples i  n  
                                    employee evaluations must not v  iolate  the law”  and that “  [a]ny changes to  
                                    proposed  regulations should make  it clear that employers must meet their  
                                    obligations  under  EERA, including the  obligation to give  notice and  to bargain in 
                                    good faith r  egarding changes to employee  evaluations standards, procedures, and  
                                    criteria.”  
                                          •     Chancellor’s Office  Response: As stated  in  our previous response,  we  
                                                disagree with CCCA’s view that adoption of  these regulations will violate  
                                                EERA.  In addition, we decline to follow  CCCA’s  recommendation to include  
                                                language to remind employers  of their  obligation to give  notice and bargain  
                                                in good  faith regarding changes to evaluation  procedures.  As previously  
                                                mentioned, the  duty to bargain is an  independent statutory  obligation  of  
                                                which districts are well  aware.  However,  the  proposed resolution  of  
                                                adoption references collective bargaining  obligations which are likely to  
                                                arise upon  adoption  of these regulations.

                                    CENTERS,  COAST MADERA COMMUNITY  COLLEGE  
                        Ray Sanchez submitted a letter  on April  25,  2022 containing a number  of  comments,  
                        which are summarized with responses below:  
                              •     Mr. Sanchez states that “[w]e should have serious concerns over the proposed  
                                    regulatory  actions” and that “[t]ying  concepts and philosophical assertions that 
                                    are  only  fairly nascent  in literature and heavily debated  in the academy and society  
                                    at large, to evaluation and  tenure review, is unwarranted  and  reminiscent of  a  
                                    Berkeley  loyalty oath.  
                                          •     Chancellor’s Office Response: The Chancellor’s  Office respectfully  
                                                disagrees with Mr. Sanchez’s characterization  that the concepts involved  in  
                                                DEIA competencies are  “fairly nascent.”  While they are  perhaps heavily  
                                                debated  in  society at large, the majority of  the stakeholders of the California 
                                                Community Colleges are  no longer  debating and  instead  moving to action.   
                                                We  reject the  characterization of these concepts as “reminiscent of a  
                                                Berkeley  loyalty oath.”  
                                                                                                                                                                            
                              •     The remainder of Mr. Sanchez’s letter appears to further call into question the 
                                    concept  of  cultural competence  by asking a  series of apparently rhetorical  
                                    questions  about what its “theoretical underpinnings”  and what it will mean  on  
                                    campuses.   Mr. Sanchez then  moves on to discuss some  of the definitions in section  
                                    52510.  However, rather than  offer constructive suggestions for improving the  
                                    proposed regulations,  it appears his submission  is mostly a critique  of concepts  
                                    and what he perceives was or was not considered  in the development of the  
                                    regulatory  language.   Mr. Sanchez asks,  “Does anyone  in  our system question  the  
                                    assumptions undergirding the work of  Kimberle  Crenshaw, Richard  Delgado, Ibram 
                                    Kendi, and  others? Or  are their claims and theories beyond  critique  and  
                                    established fact on the  order of E=MC2?”  Mr.  Sanchez then shares unfortunate  
                                    details of  his life as a self-described troubled  youth.  In  closing,  Mr. Sanchez  
                                    characterizes DEIA efforts as leading  to tribalism and division “by stating  explicitly”  
                                    that white people  are the oppressors and  people  of color are  the oppressed.   Mr.  
                                    Sanchez makes clear that he does not support the proposed regulations and  
                                    invites us to read a longer article further articulating his beliefs by  following  a link  
                                    embedded  in his letter.  
                                          •     Chancellor’s Office Response: The Chancellor’s  Office respectfully  
                                                disagrees with Mr. Sanchez’s characterization  of DEIA concepts and  his 
                                                critiques  of  the regulations.  However, he provided  no  constructive 
                                                suggestions for revising the regulations.

                        Ms. Mancini submitted  a letter to the  Chancellor’s Office  on April 25,  2022, containing a  
                        number of comments, which ar                          e  summarized  as follows:  
                              •     Ms. Mancini’s letter indicated that  CSEA appreciates “the  Board  of  Governors’  
                                    attention to  issues related  to diversity,  equity, inclusion,  and accessibility (DEIA).”   
                                    Ms. Mancini further  indicated that  CSEA’s concerns parallel those  outlined by the  
                                    joint letter submitted March 1  6, 2022  by  the CCCA, CFT, and  CCCI  (See Comment 1  
                                    above).  Ms. Mancini and CSEA  “ask the Chancellor’s Office to amend  the proposed  
                                    regulations as  follows to clarify for  community college districts the  essential role  
                                    that local bargaining units play when integrating  DEIA criteria into  employee  
                                    performance evaluations and working  conditions pursuant to these  regulations.  
                                          •     Chancellor’s Office Response: We thank CSEA for their comments and  
                                                direct  them to our response to the  CCCA,  CFT,  and CCCI  joint letter (See 
                                                Chancellor’s Office Response to Comment 1,  above).  
                              •     “These suggested amendments are based  on  the revised  regulations circulated  to  
                                                                                                                                                                                     
                                    the DEIA committee workgroup on April 19, 2022. We appreciate the diligent efforts 
                                    of the Chancellor’s office  and the  workgroup  to address concerns that the  
                                    previously  proposed text was inconsistent with requirements under the  
                                    Educational Employment Relations Act (EERA). While  this new language  is certainly  
                                    a step  in the right direction, we urge the Board of  Governors to  further amend  
                                    these regulations to make  explicit that the  impacts and  effects of any change to  
                                    employee  minimum qualifications or  to the standards for evaluating employee  
                                    performance are mandatory subjects of collective bargaining as required pursuant 
                                    to EERA.”  
                                          •     Chancellor’s Office Response:   We appreciate the recognition of the DEIA  
                                                Working Group’s efforts to address DEIA and  complete this  important work.   
                                                However, we respectfully disagree  that there  is a need to  include an  explicit 
                                                reference to  collective bargaining  obligations in these regulations.  As we  
                                                have stated in response to a number  of comments above, the  duty  to  
                                                bargain  subjects that are within  the scope  of  bargaining  is an independent  
                                                duty arising from EERA and exists whether  or not the  proposed regulations 
                                                mention  it.  As explained previously, given the time  it typically takes 
                                                regulations to become  effective after adoption by  the Board of  Governors,  
                                                there should be sufficient time for local districts to bargain any  necessary  
                                                changes to  local  evaluation and tenure review processes as a result of these  
                                                regulations.

                                          •     Chancellor’s Office Response:   Ms. Mancini’s suggested language  appears  
                                                intended to explicitly  include larger exclusive representatives into  the

                                                on DEIA  competencies and criteria.   However, the Chancellor’s Office 
                                                believes this language  is unnecessary as bargaining groups are already  
                                                included in Consultation  Council and  have  been consulted outside of that

                                                in the regulatory  language,  as that duty  is an independent duty that arises 
                                                independently whether  or not the regulations mention it.   Moreover, the  
                                                suggested language would  omit language specifying that the DEIA

                                     recognizing collective  bargaining  in these regulations is  especially vital for  
                                     classified employees who,  under these proposed regulations, may  be required to  
                                     demonstrate DEIA competencies without commensurate awareness or  training in  
                                     comparison to system faculty. Bargaining  will help clarify exactly how  classified 
                                     employees  are expected to demonstrate  DEIA  competencies within their existing  
                                     job duties.  Furthermore,  CSEA wholeheartedly agrees that investments in  
                                     professional development and training are the best way  to improve  DEIA  
                                     competencies for  both faculty and classified employees.  The Chancellor’s  office 
                                     and Board  of  Governors should  support local districts by funding  on-going 
                                     professional development trainings for  classified  employees  in particular.”

                        On May 9,  2022, Mr. Michels submitted comments indicating that section 53602(a) should  
                        convey that the  “DEIA competencies and  evaluation criteria should serve as a MODEL  for  
                        local bargaining and local discussions.”

                                                Michels’s comment reflects the  Chancellor’s Office’s understanding of what

                                     this provision should convey.  Accordingly section 53602(a) has  been revised  
                                     to reflect that understanding by indicating that the competencies used  
                                     should be those developed  locally based  on  the  Chancellor’s Office’s as a  
                                     model and  that the Chancellor’s Office’s may be used in the absence of

                                     recommended changes because  we believe  the  existing language better  
                                     reflects the belief  that all faculty members, including non-teaching faculty,  
                                     should abide by these principles.

                            view, “clearly states that incumbent employees shall  not be  disqualified from

                   Mr. Kaljumagi, as President of the California Community College Association (CCCA),  
                   submitted a letter  to  the Chancellor’s Office on May 18, 2022,  reiterating and resubmitting  
                   comments he had previously submitted  on April 25, 2022  in response to the  45-day public  
                   comment period.   Mr.  Kaljumagi’s primary contentions in the  May  18,  2022 letter are that  
                   the  Chancellor’s Office failed  to respond to or address the Association’s concerns that the  
                   proposed regulations violate the  intent of  EERA because procedures to be used  for the  
                   evaluation  of employees are within the scope of representation.  Included  in the  
                   resubmitted comments, are a number  of suggested  edits to various sections of  the  
                   proposed regulations.  Mr. Kaljumagi lists this rationale  for the bulk  of the comments  and  
                   suggested revisions.  For  example, he states repeatedly that various  provisions are 
                   “related to  evaluation  –  a mandatory subject  of bargaining” and that “[t]he regulation as  
                   drafted does not include  statutory requirements concerning the mutual  agreement  
                   between the exclusive  representative of the  professional  employees of the school  district 
                   and the governing board of the district.”  
                    
                                 •   Chancellor’s Office Response:   The  Chancellor’s Office thanks Mr.  
                                     Kaljumagi  for his submission  but again, respectfully  disagrees with the  
                                     primary  contention that the proposed regulations violate  EERA  and that 
                                     they must contain  express reference  to bargaining  obligations.   As we  
                                     pointed  out in our  previous responses to  other similar comments, the Board  
                                                                                                                                         
                                     of Governors is not a public school employer subject to the duty to bargain 
                                     under EERA,  so it is free  to enact regulations that will implicate  the duty  to  
                                     bargain  at the local  level without itself having to bargain  over  its actions.   
                                     This regulatory action is  designed  to allow  for local implementation through  
                                     the adoption of policies by local  governing boards,  in keeping with  the  
                                     community colleges local  governance model.  The proposed regulatory  
                                     action  expressly  contemplates local policy adoption which would  
                                     undoubtedly include  collective bargaining at  the local  level.  Nothing in  the  
                                     proposed regulations  precludes local bargaining.   Moreover, the duty to  
                                     bargain  over mandatory subjects is a statutory obligation that exists 
                                     independent  of the actions of the Board of Governors and, where  it is  
                                     triggered,  would apply whether or not the Board of  Governors explicitly 
                                     mentioned it in its regulations.  Because we disagree with the  premise  
                                     underlying  Mr. Kaljumagi’s suggested revisions, we  decline to incorporate  
                                     them into the proposed regulations.

                   Ms. Lum submitted  a letter on behalf of  the Los Rios College Federation of  Teachers on  
                   May 19, 2022 commenting on the inclusion of “accessibility” competencies in the  
                   proposed regulations.  Ms. Lum’s letter  was  a general  critique on t  he inclusion of  
                   accessibility within the framework of diversity, equity and inclusion.   Ms. Lum states that 
                   while they  “support the work  of accessibility,” they think it is incredibly important that 
                   the subject  matter  of accessibility be examined  separate from DEI  criteria.”   Finally, Ms.  
                   Lum and the Los Rios College Federation of  Teachers “strongly  encourage the Board  of  
                   Governors to spend  additional time to create  deliberate,  intentional, and realistic  
                   competencies related to accessibility before  including them into the  Title V regulation  
                   revisions.”  
                    
                                 •   Chancellor’s Office Response:   The  Chancellor’s Office thanks Ms.  Lum for  
                                     her submission; but declines to  postpone the  inclusion  of accessibility  
                                     within the  DEIA framework.   The language included in the regulations  
                                     provides a definition  of the term,  not the  competencies associated  with the  
                                     term.   The  determination of any  competencies related to accessibility would  
                                     be determined at the local level.   Finally,  the concept of accessibility in 
                                     general was not revised in  the proposed regulations after the  45-day public  
                                     comment  period, such  that it would not be appropriate to revisit changes to 
                                                                           
                                     those provisions at present.

                            (CCC) OF  THE CALIFORNIA FEDERATION OF TEACHERS (CFT)  
                    
                   Mr. Mahler submitted a letter  to  the Chancellor’s Office on May 20, 2022.   The letter  
                   contained a  number of comments;  which will  be summarized below.  
                    
                       •    Mr.  Mahler’s first contention  is that because the  evaluation  criteria are subject to  
                            mandatory bargaining,  the proposed regulations violate  the right to  bargain.  
                             
                                 •   Chancellor’s Office Response:  The Chancellor’s Office respectfully  
                                     disagrees with  Mr. Mahler  on this point.  As explained  in our previous  
                   31
                                                responses to other similar  comments, the Board of  Governors is not a public  
                                                school employer subject to the  duty to bargain under  EERA, so  it is free to  
                                                enact regulations that  may  implicate the  duty to  bargain at the local level  
                                                without itself having to bargain  over its actions.   In such cases, local  
                                                districts would still be  obligated to bargain  those terms and conditions  
                                                before implementing.  
                                     
                              •     Mr.  Mahler  further  contends that the proposed modifications to the  minimum 
                                    qualifications exceed the grant of  authority to the  Chancellor’s Office and violate 
                                    academic freedom.  
                         
                                          •     Chancellor’s Office Response:  The Chancellor’s Office respectfully  
                                                disagrees with Mr. Mahler’s contention regarding  the  authority of the  
                                                                                                                                                                
                                                Chancellor’s Office.  As previously stated in response to another 
                                                commenter, the Chancellor’s Office  is acting  within its “full authority to  
                                                adopt rules and regulations necessary and proper to  execute the functions 
                                                specified  in this section as well as other  functions that the board  of  
                                                                                                                                                     
                                                governors is expressly authorized by statute to regulate.”  (Ed. Code, sec. 
                                                70901, subd. (c).)   These functions  include, in relevant part, “[e]stablishing  
                                                minimum standards for employment of  college  district employees.” (Ed.  
                                                Code, sec.  70901, subd. (b)(1)(B).).  
                                                Accordingly, we  believe the  Chancellor’s Office and the Board of Governors  
                                                act within their authority in  enacting  the  proposed regulations as minimum 
                                                standards with respect to evaluation and tenure review.   With respect to  
                                                violating academic freedom, as we  have  pointed out to  various other  
                                                commenters, we disagree with that analysis and  decline  to make  changes to  
                                                the proposed regulations based  on those assertions.  
                                                 
                              •     Mr.  Mahler’s letter also contends that the proposed regulations should  not include  
                                    accessibility as those standards are defined  by the state  and federal law.

                                                disagrees with Mr. Mahler’s contention.   Notwithstanding, as stated  in our  
                                                response to comment 6 above,  the  concept  of  accessibility in general was  
                                                not revised  in the proposed regulations after the  45-day public  comment  
                                                period, such that it would  not be  appropriate to revisit changes to  those  
                                                provisions at present.

                   Mr.  Cohn submitted  a letter to the  Chancellor’s Office  on  May  20,  2022,  in response to the  
                   revisions made to  the  proposed regulations after the  45-day public comment period.   As  
                   previously  stated in  his April  22,  2022 letter,  Mr.  Cohn asserts that although  some of the 
                   revisions we previously made “are a step in the right direction,” he  continues in his belief 
                   that the proposed regulations violate  the First Amendment rights of  the  faculty.  Mr. Cohn  
                   and FIRE continue to urge that the  Board  of Governors reject the proposed regulations.  
                    
                                 •   Chancellor’s Office Response:  The Chancellor’s Office continues to  
                                     respectfully disagree  with Mr. Cohn’s analysis and denies that the  proposed  
                                     regulations would violate  faculty  members’ First Amendment rights or  
                                     academic freedom.   We stand by  our response (response  9,  above) to Mr.

                   Mr.  Hu submitted a letter to the  Chancellor’s Office  on May  20, 2022  commenting on the  
                   inclusion of “accessibility” competencies  in the proposed  regulations.   Generally, the  
                   letter  requested that the  Board of Governors “separate  the issues of  ‘Diversity, Equity,  and  
                   Inclusion (DEI)’  from ‘Accessibility.’”

                                     the submission,  but declines to  postpone the  inclusion  of accessibility  
                                     within the  DEIA framework.   The  language included  in the regulations 
                                     provides  a definition of the term,  not the  competencies associated  with the  
                                     term.   The  determination of any  competencies related to accessibility would  
                                     be determined at the local level.   Finally,  the concept of accessibility  in 
                                     general was not revised in  the proposed regulations after the  45-day public  
                                     comment  period, such  that it would not be appropriate to revisit changes to
