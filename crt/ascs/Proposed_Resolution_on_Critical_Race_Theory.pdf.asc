                                                                                                  
                                                 RESOLUTION NO. ________ 
                                          CRITICAL RACE THEORY IN SCHOOLS 
                                                                 
                
               WHEREAS, the newly adopted Senate Bill 5044, SB 5227, and SB 5228 address 
               dealing with institutional or structural racism in public education and the passage of 
               these bills have raised issues and questions among the public regarding critical race 
               theory being taught in the schools; 
               2.     SB 5227 and 5228 address medical schools and higher education and do not 
               impact the South Kitsap School District directly; 
               3.     SB 5044 mandates training in the 2023-2024 school year for public school 
               staff and school board directors in the areas of “cultural competency, diversity, 
               equity, and inclusions” with one of the purposes of the act being “dismantling 
               institutional racism”; 
               4.     Even though SB 5044 does not mention nor mandate adoption or teaching of 
               critical race theory by name, the use of the term “institutional racism”, also know as 
               systemic racism, or structural racism, is considered by many to be a key component 
               of critical race theory and therefore is seen as opening the door for critical race 
               theory concepts to be taught in the schools, first to the staff, then to the students; 
               5.     By definition, a theory is not an established fact, but a speculative 
               explanation of the relationship of facts, and theory should not be taught as fact; 
               6.     While critical race theory originated in academic and legal circles as far back 
               as the 1970’s, as used today by both its proponents, opponents and the media, the 
               term has had added to it many more components, going beyond race alone, and 
               thus making it difficult to define exactly what is included when the term critical race 
               theory is used;  
               7.     Because of the difficulty in defining critical race theory here, and the fact that 
               concepts often have their own labels changed over time to make them more 
               acceptable, no attempt will be made here to define critical race theory, however 
               various components that have been attributed to it will be addressed here; now 
               there be it 
                
               RESOLVED, That the Board of Directors of the South Kitsap School District declares 
               its opposition to the following concepts being taught as fact to staff or students: 
                      (a)     That America is an inherently racist country with white supremacists 
                              maintaining power through law, culture, and institutional practices; 
                      (b)     That there is a hierarchy of power with straight, white, males at the 
                              top; 
                        (c)    That oppressed groups, identified by race, sex, gender, religion, etc., 
                               not at the top of the hierarchy, are victims who are not responsible for 
                               their conditions; 
                        (d)    That those at the top should feel guilty for the sins of their ancestors 
                               that gave them their privilege; 
                        (e)    That those at the top of the hierarchy should make apologies and 
                               reparations to those below them on the hierarchy; 
                        (f)    That, by definition, only those at the top of the hierarchy can be racist; 
                        (g)    That the very criticism of these concepts is proof that they are true, 
                2.  That all training and instructional materials used or proposed to be used in the 
                District are available for public inspection in advance and members of the public are 
                encouraged to inspect those materials in advance and point out to the District and 
                the Board any particular matters of concern; 
                3.  That equity of opportunity should be provided to all, but equity of outcome is up 
                to individual achievement; 
                4.  That the Board encourages and directs the teaching of the following concepts to 
                staff and students: 
                        (a)    Injustices committed upon members of various groups, based upon 
                race, sex, gender, religion, etc., are a part of United States history, and that history 
                needs to be taught accurately in order to avoid repeating those injustices; 
                        (b)    The United States has made tremendous progress in race relations 
                over the past century, and the process to achieve this progress should be 
                acknowledged; 
                        (c)    People should be judged by the content of their character and not by 
                the color of their skin; 
                        (d)    All students and staff have a responsibility to be alert to factors that 
                may contribute to any institutional racism or other discrimination and bring those 
                factors to the attention of the District so that they may be appropriately addressed; 
                5.  That the District already has in place policy to address individual acts of 
                discrimination or racism in the schools. 
                 
                ADOPTED by the Board of Directors of South Kitsap School District No. 402, Kitsap 
                County, Washington, at a regular meeting thereof, held on the ___day of 
                _________, 2021.
