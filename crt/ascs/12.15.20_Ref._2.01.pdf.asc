               Board of School Trustees
               Clark County School District
               5100 West Sahara Ave.
               Las Vegas, NV  89146
               702-799-CCSD
               Dear Board of School Trustees,
               The Las Vegas Alliance of Black School Educators (LVABSE) is a nonprofit organization with a 
               mission to enhance and facilitate educational opportunities and social development of all 
               students, especially underrepresented and underserved Black/African American children, by 
               developing partnerships, creating professional development, promoting the placement of 
               Black/African American leaders, and shaping public policy. We are guided by the legacy and 
               principles of the late Congressman and activist John Lewis, who reminds us <to get in good 
               trouble, necessary trouble, and help redeem the soul of America.=
               The purpose of this letter is to ask the Board of School Trustees to vote to remove Dr. Jesus F. 
               Jara from his role as Superintendent.We believe that our leadership, especially the 
               Superintendent of the Clark County School District (CCSD) should display accountability during 
               crucial moments. We, the members of LVABSE have lost our sense of trust in Superintendent 
               Jara’s abilities to effectively lead with honesty. We were disheartened to learn that Governor 
               Sisolak and the Superintendent of Public Instruction, Jhone Ebert, publicly released a statement 
               to denounce Superintendent Jara’s decision making during a special session of the Nevada 
               Legislature. Governor Sisolak also stated, <While I’m not surprised, I’m incredibly disappointed 
               that once again Superintendent Jara has tried to mislead the communities he represents.= CCSD 
               is firm in their application process, that signs of dishonesty will make your application null and 
               void. That same level of expectation should hold true for theSuperintendent. Our governmental 
               leaders should hold one another accountable for their actions. Holding an office or leading a 
               school district is a privilege that many qualified individuals would be honored to hold. It seems 
               that the powers and duties of the Superintendent have been taken for granted. Superintendent 
               Jara represents the wider community of Las Vegas throughout the United States and has not 
               represented us well.

               Currently, there is no Black representation  on the Board of School Trustees, since Trustee 
               Young has termed out beginning in January. Dating back to the beginning of the Board with 
               District C, notables such as Bernice Moten, Virginia Brewster, James McMillan, Yvonne 
               Atkinson Gates, John Rhodes, Shirely Barber, and outgoing Dr. Linda Young, the discussion has 
               always been on the topics of equity, diversity, excellence, inclusion and systemic racism. With 
               Superintendent Jara, the communication has fallen on deaf ears in regards to educational 
               opportunities that  impact African American students, families, employees, and business 
               opportunities. 
               The entire world, including our beloved community is experiencing unprecedented times. Covid-
               19 is sweeping through our communities and  impacting parents, educators, staff, stakeholders, 
               and most importantly our children. The mistrust that has been established by Superintendent Jara 
               makes it quite difficult to entrust him with vital decision making in matters that concern the 
               education of our children, and vulnerable communities. 
               On top of Covid-19 stress, let us not forget the impact of the murder of George Floyd and the 
               countless loss of Black lives due to police brutality. These incidents specifically impact Black 
               students and need to be addressed.  In times of distress, we depend on our leaders to make timely 
               and sound decisions. The expectation is that those who lead us will speak on our behalf with a 
               spirit of integrity and honesty. After the death of George Floyd, numerous universities and 
               corporate leaders, locally and globally, wrote formal letters or gave statements about their 
               institutions and stance on racial inequality and its impact on Black people. There was support of 
               the Black Lives Matter movement nation-wide. While, CCSD sent a very informal letter to 
               parents, we were hoping that a thoughtful and reflective letter from our Superintendent would be 
               in order to address being in solidarity with educators, staff, and the most vulnerable, our 
               students. Thoughtful and  reflective conversations around race and racism should lead to an 
               evaluation of how systemic injustices have infiltrated our educational systems. Without these 
               important conversations, the implementation of just practices may not be actualized. 
               Not only do we request a comprehensive Covid-19 plan, we also request a comprehensive plan 
               of how systemic racism will be abolished within CCSD. A Black feminist scholar reminds us 
               that critical race theory (CRT) aims to reexamine the terms by which race and racism have 
               negotiated in American consciousness.  Where has racism found its way within our educational 
               community? There is no way to fulfill CCSD’s Focus:2024’s biggest priority of ensuring quality 
               and access to historically underserved and under-resourced communities without first 
               acknowledging the oppression and racism within the educational system that prevents qualified 
               educators and staff from leadership roles and the oppression and racism that prevents brilliant 
               minds from performing their best in the classroom and ultimately leading productive lives.  
               We appreciate the time and effort the school Board of Trustees gives to serving the students 
               within our community. We look forward to working together to ensure that every student in the 
               Clark County School District receives a high-quality education.
