      Introduction: Letter from the Superintendent-President, Academic 
      Senate President, and Classified Senate President 
      Dear Campus Community,  
      Long Beach City College has always recognized the critical role that participatory governance plays in achieving 
      our mission. Our participatory governance structure is designed to emphasize responsibility, collaboration, and 
      inclusivity among constituencies to ensure all voices are heard in decision-making processes. Through these 
      processes, faculty, classified staff, administrators, and students are invited to participate in planning for our 
      future and providing recommendations on decisions that will have an institutional impact. As Superintendent-
      President, Academic Senate President, and Classified Senate President, we are committed to participatory 
      governance and believe that participatory governance is essential to fostering innovation and transformational 
      change to achieve our College mission and strategic plan goals. 
      The College’s 2020-2023 Participatory Governance and Institutional Planning Handbook is intended to 
      promote a shared understanding of participatory governance processes at the College and was developed 
      through thoughtful and collegial self-reflection by our College Planning Council. The members of this council 
      have worked hard to make our Handbook user-friendly, thorough, and informative. The sections in the 
      Handbook include frequently asked questions, clarification on constituent group roles, key participatory 
      governance council and committee definitions, and the roles and responsibilities of co- and tri-chairs, 
      members, resources, and guests. The Handbook also outlines the processes that lead to recommendations on 
      Board Policies and Administrative Procedures, as well as institutional planning. It is our hope that this 
      Handbook will increase awareness and understanding of participatory governance, help to ensure consistent 
      application of governance practices, encourage broad and equitable participation in campus matters, and 
      support the College’s continuous quality improvement efforts.  
      We encourage our Long Beach City College community – faculty, staff, administrators, and students to work 
      through your constituent group leaders to participate and have a voice in participatory governance! Diversity, 
      equity, and inclusion in participatory governance is essential to informing decisions in the best interest of our 
      students and employees.  
      Sincerely,  
       
      Dr. Mike Muñoz, Interim Superintendent-President 
      Suman Mudunuri, Academic Senate President 
      CC Sadler, Classified Senate President

      Long Beach City College Participatory Governance Philosophy 
      Participatory governance at Long Beach City College is a college-wide process that recognizes the 
      right and responsibility of all faculty, staff, administrators, and students to participate in decision-
      making processes at the College. The participatory governance structure provides opportunities for 
      all constituent groups to contribute justified and thoughtful recommendations on matters pertaining 
      to policies and procedures, planning, program review, and accreditation. In the spirit of collaboration, 
      cooperation, and collegiality, constituent group members in participatory governance work toward 
      the betterment of the College and the students served by the College to achieve the College’s mission 
      by sharing their viewpoints and recommendations, gathering and sharing recommendations from 
      their constituent groups at large, and communicating the work of participatory governance bodies 
      broadly across campus.  
      Long Beach City College’s participatory governance philosophy embraces the diverse perspectives 
      and backgrounds of all constituent group members. The College’s philosophy recognizes that while 
      ultimate decisions lie with the Board of Trustees and the Superintendent-President, the College is 
      grounded in the core belief that decisions are richer and better informed by the collective wisdom of 
      constituent groups working together through participatory governance. And while participatory 
      governance may not always constitute agreement by all, the governance process ensures that all 
      perspectives are heard, respected, and genuinely considered prior to decisions being reached on 
      participatory governance-related matters. 
      The Long Beach City College participatory governance philosophy affirms and applies the principles 
      outlined in the Long Beach City College Code of Ethics (Board Policy and Administrative 
      Procudure3008). Participatory governance must facilitate a climate of trust, mutual support, and 
      courteous consideration. It is the philosophy of the College that all constituent groups demonstrate 
      respect for reason, freedom of expression, and the right to dissent in participatory governance. 
      Participants must exhibit mutual respect, cooperation, promote a team environment, and confront 
      issues and people without prejudice. When participating in governance, participants demonstrate 
      due diligence in their committee work and model the highest standard of ethically responsible 
      behavior.

      Frequently Asked Questions About Participatory Governance  
      What is participatory governance? 
      Participatory Governance at Long Beach City College (LBCC) is the process of emphasizing 
      responsibility, collaboration, and inclusivity among all constituencies through participation in College 
      decision-making processes. Each constituency has recognized roles and responsibilities as described 
      in state legislation (Appendix D) and the Long Beach Community College District Board Policy and 
      Administrative Procedures 2510. 
      What is the purpose of participatory governance? 
      Participatory governance ensures that full and part-time faculty, classified staff, students, and 
      managers have the opportunity to share their perspectives, viewpoints, and input by participating in 
      the development of policies and procedures, the accreditation self-evaluation process, and the 
      development and implementation of plans, priorities, and initiatives. Through participatory 
      governance all constituent groups have the opportunity to be included in the College’s decision-
      making processes. Participatory governance also ensures the right of the Academic Senate to assume 
      the primary responsibility for making recommendations in areas pertaining to academic and 
      professional matters.  
      Is participatory governance required for California Community Colleges? 
      Yes. In 1988 Assembly Bill (AB) 1725 was passed, which established the Academic Senate’s role as the 
      primary voice in providing recommendations to California Community College Board of Trustees in 
      academic and professional matters. AB 1725 is enacted through Title 5 of the California Code of 
      Regulations. Title 5 requires each College’s Board of Trustees to consult collegially with the Academic 
      Senate by relying primarily upon their advice or reaching mutual agreement on academic and 
      professional matters, which are further defined in legislation. Title 5 and California Education Code 
      also require the Board to ensure the right and effective participation of faculty, classified staff, and 
      students in the development of recommendations on college governance. Since LBCC is accredited by 
      the Accrediting Commission of Community and Junior Colleges, the College is also required to remain 
      in compliance with accreditation standards and ensure that all constituents have a voice in decision-
      making processes. All related legislation and accreditation standards are further defined in Appendix 
      D. 
      How does LBCC engage in participatory governance? 
      Long Beach City College engages in participatory governance through the College’s participatory 
      governance committee structure and through the related multi-level process of Annual Planning and 
      Program Review (APPR). Each committee has a specific purpose, function, and membership to ensure 
      that all constituents have the opportunity to participate in decision-making related to planning for 
      the future of the College, the accreditation self-evaluation process, and developing policies and 
      procedures to accomplish the College’s mission. Additionally, through the APPR process, goal-setting 
      and the evaluation of progress toward goals occurs at all levels of the College to achieve the mission. 
      This process also provides the opportunity for all constituents to request resources to accomplish 
                                                   7 
       
      their area goals and provides a structured process for representatives of all constituent groups to 
      participate in the prioritization of those resource requests for funding. 
      How do I fit into the participatory governance structure? 
      As an employee or student at LBCC, you are a part of one of our constituent groups, which appoints 
      representatives to our participatory governance committees. Through committee participation you 
      have the opportunity to provide your recommendations and feedback on the development and 
      implementation of college-wide plans, the accreditation self-evaluation process, and the 
      development of and modifications to college policies and procedures. If there are no vacancies on 
      committees for your constituent group, you can always attend any participatory governance 
      committee meeting as a guest. Each year you also have the opportunity to participate in the Annual 
      Planning and Program Review process. This process involves all constituents across campus and 
      begins with all instructional programs and non-instructional departments analyzing data to establish 
      or describe progress toward program or department goals and activities. This is also an opportunity 
      for each program and department to request needed resources. As described later in this Handbook, 
      this is a multi-level process and opportunities exist for you to participate at each level, which 
      ultimately results in institutional priorities for the coming year and resource requests prioritized for 
      funding to accomplish the College’s Strategic Plan and mission. 
      How can I participate on a participatory governance council, committee, subcommittee, or 
      taskforce? 
      Each constituent group emails out “all calls” when vacancies in the membership of a council, 
      committee, subcommittee, or taskforce arise. All calls are sent to all constituent group members. 
      When you receive an all call email and want to be considered for membership, respond with your 
      interest following the instructions provided by your constituent group. Each constituent group also 
      has their own term limits for how long you can serve on a committee, which will be explained to you 
      by your respective constituent group. If there are no existing vacancies on a council, committee, 
      subcommittee, or taskforce, or if you are just interested in attending periodically as a guest, contact 
      the co- or tri-chairs of the council, committee, subcommittee, or taskforce you are interested in to 
      ask for the meeting location or zoom link for the meetings.  
      How does participatory governance fit into my work day? 
      Participatory governance fits into the work day of all constituent group members! For full-time 
      faculty, participation on participatory governance councils, committees, subcommittees, and 
      taskforces can count toward required college service hours. Part-time faculty can receive stipends to 
      participate on participatory governance councils, committees, subcommittees, and taskforces 
      (specific stipend amounts are listed in the Certificated Hourly Instructors contract). For classified 
      professionals, the College Planning Council has approved a Classified Senate Participatory 
      Governance Support Statement that states that the District understands the crucial role of classified 
      professionals as a part of participatory governance and that their time spent at council, committee, 
      subcommittee, or taskforce meetings is included as a part of their work day. Management are 
      appointed by President’s Cabinet to serve on specific participatory governance councils, committees, 
                                                   8 
       
      subcommittees, and/or taskforces or are appointed based on their position and are expected to make 
      time during their work day to attend the meetings of the councils, committees, subcommittees, 
      and/or taskforces to which they were appointed. 
      I was just elected to a committee, what do I need to know? 
      As a new member of a committee, refer to the “Planning Committee Member Responsibilities” 
      section of this Handbook. You should also visit the committee webpage to review the charge and 
      membership. It is also recommended that you reach out to the committee co- or tri-chairs to learn 
      more about what the committee is currently working on and how you can contribute. 
      What can this Handbook help me with? 
      This Handbook is intended to be used as a toolbox for those who want to learn more about 
      participatory governance and institutional planning at Long Beach City College. The focus of this 
      Handbook is on participatory governance committees and processes that include membership from 
      all constituent groups. The Handbook does not focus on the committees of specific college 
      representative bodies (i.e., this Handbook will not detail the Academic Senate committee structure, 
      Classified Senate, or Associated Student Body committee structures). The Handbook is also intended 
      to provide clarification on roles and responsibilities of committee chairs, members, resources, and 
      guests. Finally, the Handbook will help to explain our institutional planning processes and the 
      alignment between our participatory governance planning committees, Strategic Plan, college-wide 
      plans, and the Annual Planning and Program Review process. 
      What is the role of the Board of Trustees in Participatory Governance? 
      While the Board of Trustees ultimately establishes and approves all Board Policies and ensures the 
      fiscal health of the College, the Board of Trustees encourages the participation of all constituent 
      groups in providing input on Board Policy and Administrative Procedure development, as well as 
      college planning which is directly tied to resource allocation and the college budget. The Board 
      supports and encourages broad participation in governance through collaborative college-wide 
      processes. As the next section in this Handbook describes, the Board recognizes each constituent 
      group’s role in governance, exclusive of collecting bargaining issues.  
       
                    
                                                   9 
       
      Long Beach Community College District Board Policy and Administrative 
      Procedures 2510 
      Long Beach Community College District defines participation in local decision-making as a 
      collaborative college-wide process dependent on trust and open communication. Participation in 
      college decision-making, as provided for in Title 5 of the California Code of Regulations, acknowledges 
      the special roles of faculty, classified staff, and students, while recognizing that the Board of Trustees 
      is the ultimate decision-maker in areas assigned to it by state and federal laws and regulations. The 
      essential activities of the College decision-making process are policy and procedure development and 
      college planning implementation and review. Participation in governance includes shared planning, 
      justified and thoughtful recommendations, and delegating responsibilities to appropriate areas. The 
      College’s participatory governance structure includes the President’s Leadership Council, College 
      Planning Council and other specified planning committees and task forces, and the Accreditation 
      Steering Committee. As outlined in Board Policy and Administrative Procedure 2510 and union 
      negotiated contracts with the District, and in compliance with AB1725, Title 5, California Education 
      Code, and Accreditation Standards, the following College Representative Bodies participate in the 
      decision-making processes of the district: 
      Academic Senate Participation 
      The Board of Trustees recognizes the Academic Senate as the official body which represents the 
      faculty in participatory governance relating to academic and professional matters. The Board of 
      Trustees, or the Superintendent-President as designee, consults collegially with representatives of 
      the Academic Senate when adopting policies and procedures on academic and professional matters. 
      Policies and procedures on academic and professional matters shall not be adopted until such 
      consultation has occurred.  
      The Board of Trustees or its designees will rely primarily upon the advice and judgement of the 
      Academic Senate on:  
      1. Curriculum, including prerequisites and placing courses within disciplines;  
      2. Degree and certificate requirements; 
      3. Grading policies;  
      4. Standards or policies regarding student preparation and success;  
      5. Policies for faculty professional development activities.  
       
      For those academic and professional matters where the Board of Trustees or its designees have 
      agreed to rely primarily on the advice and judgment of the Academic Senate, recommendations of 
      the Academic Senate will normally be accepted, and only in exceptional circumstances and for 
      compelling reasons will the recommendations not be accepted. In alignment with Title 5 Regulations, 
      Section 53203(d)(1), if an Academic Senate recommendation is not accepted by the Board of 
      Trustees, the Board of Trustees or the Superintendent-President or designee shall promptly 
      communicate the reasons in writing to the Academic Senate upon request. 
       
                                                  10 
       
      The Board of Trustees or its designees will reach mutual agreement with the Academic Senate on:  
      6. Processes for program review;  
      7. Educational program development;  
      8. District and college governance structures and accreditation as related to faculty roles;  
      9. Faculty roles and involvement in accreditation processes, including self-study and annual reports; 
      10. Processes for institutional planning and budget development.  
       
      For those academic and professional matters where the Board of Trustees or its designees have 
      agreed to reach mutual agreement, and agreement has not been reached, existing policy will remain 
      in effect unless continuing with such policy exposes the District to legal liability or causes substantial 
      financial hardship (Title 5 § 53203(d)(2). In cases where there is no existing policy, or in cases where 
      the exposure to legal liability or financial hardship requires existing policy to be changed, the Board 
      may act, after a good faith effort to reach agreement, only for compelling legal, fiscal, or 
      organizational reasons. 
       
      If an academic and professional matter arises which is not enumerated in the ten academic and 
      professional matters listed above, the Board of Trustees or designee and the Academic Senate shall 
      mutually agree whether the Board shall rely primarily upon the advice and judgment of the Academic 
      Senate or shall reach mutual agreement with the Academic Senate with regard to that matter. 
       
      Classified Senate Participation 
      The Board of Trustees recognizes the Classified Senate as the official body, which represents classified 
      staff in collegial participatory governance, exclusive of collective bargaining issues. The 
      recommendations and opinions of the Classified Senate shall be given every reasonable 
      consideration. Classified Senate members are included in all participatory governance committee 
      memberships at the college.  
      Associated Student Body Participation 
      The Board of Trustees recognizes the Associated Student Body Cabinet as the official body which 
      represents the students in participatory governance relating to student matters. The Board, through 
      the Superintendent-President or designee, shall provide students the opportunity to participate 
      effectively in the formulation and development of policies and procedures that have or will have a 
      significant effect on students. This right shall include the opportunity to participate in processes for 
      jointly developing recommendations regarding policies and procedures. The Board of Trustees shall 
      ensure that recommendations and positions developed by the Associated Student Body Cabinet or its 
      designee are given every reasonable consideration. Associated Student Body members are included 
      in all participatory governance committee memberships at the college. 
      Certificated Hourly Instructor (CHI) Participation 
      Certificated Hourly Instructors participate on participatory governance committees. As outlined in the 
      CHI negotiated contract with the District, they represent the part-time faculty voice in matters 
                                                  11 
       
      pertaining to the CHI contract and working conditions, participatory governance committee topics, 
      and academic and professional matters that impact hourly faculty members.  
      Long Beach City College Faculty Association (LBCCFA) 
      The Long Beach City College Faculty Association appoints representatives to certain participatory 
      governance committees that may discuss matters that pertain to working conditions or the LBCCFA 
      contract with the District. These committees include the President’s Leadership Council, Accreditation 
      Steering Committee, College Planning Council, Faculty and Staff Diversity Committee, Budget 
      Advisory Committee, and Facilities Advisory Committee.  
      Long Beach Council of Classified Employees (American Federation of 
      Teachers) 
      The Long Beach Council of Classified Employees also appoints representatives to all participatory 
      governance committees as established in the LBCCE/AFT Collective Bargaining Contract with the 
      District. In instances where a committee only has one classified staff representative listed in the 
      membership, the Classified Senate President will defer the appointment to the Classified Union 
      President. Classified union representatives are members of participatory governance committees to 
      speak to any matters that pertain to the contact or working conditions.  
      Management Participation 
      Administrators, managers, and confidentials are represented by individuals appointed by the 
      President’s Cabinet.

      Committee Definitions 
      Committee Definitions 
      There are multiple types of committees at Long Beach City College. Some councils, committees, 
      subcommittees, taskforces, and work groups are operational in nature and do not fall within the 
      participatory governance structure (i.e., they are convened by a director, dean, or Vice President to 
      make decisions on implementation and/or improvements to operational tasks and division 
      functions).  
      This section is intended to clarify definitions related to the representative bodies that participate in 
      governance, as well as the definitions related to participatory governance committees at LBCC.   
      College Representative Bodies 
      College representative bodies include the Academic Senate, Classified Senate, and Associated 
      Student Body. These representative bodies are required by Title 5. The committees and 
      subcommittees for each of these representative bodies follow the Brown Act rules of procedure 
      (Government Code §§54950). The committees and subcommittees for these bodies are responsible 
      for providing representative perspectives in the College’s decision-making process and making 
      recommendations to the Vice Presidents, Superintendent-President, and Board of Trustees. The 
      Academic Senate’s Committee on Curriculum and Instruction (CCI) and CCI Subcommittees make 
      recommendations on program and course curriculum, as well as Board Policies and Administrative 
      Procedures related to academic and professional matters directly to the Board of Trustees. Academic 
      Senate Executive Committee and Academic Affairs and Student Services administrators also meet 
      monthly during the academic year to discuss academic and professional matters in Academic Council.  
      The Academic Senate, Classified Senate, and Associated Student Body each appoint representative 
      members to the participatory governance committees described in the section above. Management 
      representatives are appointed by President’s Cabinet. 
      Participatory Governance Committee Structure 
      As previously mentioned, the College ensures that all constituents have a voice in decision-making 
      processes through a participatory governance committee structure. All participatory governance 
      councils, committees, subcommittees, and taskforces include faculty, classified staff, student, and 
      administrator members. Participatory governance committees are not written into Brown Act 
      legislation and are not legally required to follow Robert’s Rules of Order. The Participatory 
      Governance structure is evaluated on a six-year cycle in alignment with the development of the 
      College’s Strategic Plan (see Appendix G). The highest-level participatory governance bodies are the 
      Accreditation Steering Committee, President’s Leadership Council, and College Planning Council. The 
      participatory governance committee structure is described below:  
          
                                                  13 
       
         Accreditation Steering Committee 
         The Accreditation Steering Committee and the Accreditation Standard Committees are the 
         main participatory governance committees for the College’s institutional self-evaluation 
         process. The Accreditation Steering Committee and Accreditation Standard Committees are 
         active only during the College’s institutional self-evaluation process and are activated through 
         review and approval of their charges and memberships at the College Planning Council. The 
         Accreditation Steering Committee ensures the development of the Institutional Self-
         Evaluation Report by providing direction, training, support, and feedback to the Accreditation 
         Standards Committees as they draft each section of the report and gather evidence.  
            Accreditation Standard Committee Definition 
            Each Accreditation Standard Committee facilitates the College’s Institutional Self-
            Evaluation process through the composition of certain standard area portion(s) of the 
            Institutional Self-Evaluation Report, as well as through the gathering and citation of 
            relevant and appropriate evidence. The Accreditation Standard Committees ensure the 
            development of a comprehensive report for their assigned areas that reflects an 
            accurate description of the areas being reviewed.  
         President’s Leadership Council  
         President’s Leadership Council (PLC) is the primary participatory governance advisory body to 
         the Superintendent-President for the purpose of reviewing proposed new or changes to 
         existing college Board Policies (BPs) and Administrative Procedures (APs). All BPs and APs are 
         reviewed on a staggered six-year cycle to ensure they remain up-to-date and in compliance 
         with standards and expectations set by federal and state legislation and regulations. The 
         Council also serves as a consultative body for the Superintendent-President on issues of 
         college leadership and matters of college-wide importance, other than those which are 
         subject to consultation with the Academic Senate as academic and professional matters and 
         with the bargaining units as contractual matters. 
         Planning Committees 
         The College Planning Council (CPC) and the planning committees that report to the CPC are 
         the main participatory governance committees for institutional planning at Long Beach City 
         College. Planning committees serve as recommending bodies for the College’s development, 
         coordination, and implementation of planning efforts in fulfillment of the College’s mission. 
         Committee members consider matters pertaining to a designated charge and report 
         recommendations to the appropriate constituent groups and college leadership. The CPC 
         ultimately directs the work of all planning committees and approves their charges and 
         memberships. Planning committees may have subcommittees or taskforces that are also 
         approved by the CPC to carry out specific tasks and functions for a planning committee. There 
         are three types of planning committees: 
             
                                                  14 
       
            Planning Committee Definition 
            A planning committee is a participatory governance body established to support the 
            coordination of the college’s planning efforts in fulfillment of the College’s mission. 
            Committees serve as recommending bodies for the College’s development and 
            implementation of planning efforts. Committee members consider matters pertaining 
            to a designated charge and report recommendations to the appropriate constituent 
            groups and the CPC. The CPC ultimately directs the work of all planning committees 
            and approves their charges and memberships. 
            Planning Subcommittee Definition 
            A planning subcommittee is a participatory governance body that reports to and 
            serves as a recommending body to a specific planning committee. A planning 
            subcommittee provides recommendations to the planning committee based on their 
            approved charge. The recommendation for the formation of a subcommittee may 
            come from the CPC or a standing committee of the CPC. The CPC must approve the 
            charge and member of a subcommittee.  
            Planning Taskforce Definition 
            A planning taskforce is developed by the CPC, a planning committee, or planning 
            subcommittee to provide recommendations on specific college-wide initiatives or 
            tasks and meets until the initiatives or task is completed. A taskforce has a pre-
            determined amount of time to complete the work prior to disbanding. Regular report-
            outs on progress toward accomplishment of the initiatives or tasks must be provided 
            to the council, committee, or subcommittee that the taskforce reports to. The charge 
            and membership of a planning taskforce must be approved by the CPC.  
            Planning Work Group Definition 
            A planning work group is developed by a planning council, committee, subcommittee, 
            or taskforce to complete specific tasks and meets for a short pre-determined amount 
            of time. The planning work group must provide regular updates to the council, 
            committee, subcommittee, or taskforce that the work group reports to. A planning 
            work group does not need an official charge and membership and is not approved by 
            the CPC.

             Participatory Governance Structure 
                    
                                                                                                                                                               16

             Planning Committee Annual Reporting Cycle  
             The College Planning Council has established an annual reporting cycle to provide structure and 
             support to planning committees, subcommittees, and taskforces in monitoring progress toward the 
             accomplishment of their plans, purpose, and functions to ultimately support the achievement of the 
             Strategic Plan goals and College mission. 
             This cycle consists of the following: 
                 •   The Office of Institutional Effectiveness will work with each committee, subcommittee and 
                     taskforce on a cyclical basis to establish Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and 
                     Timebound (SMART) metrics and identify relevant representative activities to achieve the 
                     SMART metrics. 
                         o  SMART metrics and activities must be aligned with the College’s institutional priorities, 
                             Strategic Plan goals, and mission. 
                 •   All planning committees, subcommittees, and taskforces will establish a timeline of review for 
                     all SMART metrics each year. 
                 •   At the end of each academic year committees, subcommittees, and taskforces will submit a 
                     report using a prescribed template from the CPC that describes accomplishments and areas of 
                     improvement. 
                 •   The September CPC meeting will be a joint meeting with the CPC and all committee, 
                     subcommittee, and taskforce co- and tri-chairs. The Office of Institutional Effectiveness will 
                     present a synthesized overview of all submitted reports, along with the Institutional Priorities 
                     to kick off the academic year. This will provide committees, subcommittees, and taskforces 
                     with the opportunity to celebrate their hard work and successes, receive feedback and 
                     support from the CPC for the coming year, and receive information on the fiscal adopted 
                     budget and institutional priorities to drive their work.

             Institutional Planning 
             Through the participatory governance planning committee structure, LBCC has developed a robust 
             institutional planning process that involves all constituent groups and all areas of the college. The 
             College Planning Council leads all planning efforts on campus to ensure the accomplishment of the 
             College’s mission, vision, and values. 
             The following sections detail each level of planning at LBCC, as displayed on the Integrated Planning 
             Model Chart: 
                                                                                                                                   
              
             Strategic Plan and College Planning Council 
             Every four years, the College Planning Council develops the College’s Strategic Plan. The Strategic 
             Plan establishes the primary goals that the College will work toward to accomplish the College’s 
             mission, vision, and values. The plan also includes strategies that the College plans to implement to 
             ensure the goals are accomplished. The College Planning Council also works closely with Institutional 
             Effectiveness to ensure measurable outcomes are in place to monitor progress toward the 
             accomplishment of each Strategic Plan goal. Progress on measurable outcomes is reported out to the 
                                                                                                                        25 
              
              
             CPC and the Board of Trustees each year. In addition to developing the Strategic Plan, the College 
             Planning Council is charged with monitoring progress on the implementation of the Strategic Plan.  
             College-Wide Plans and Planning Committees 
             The majority of the planning committees that the College Planning Council oversees are charged with 
             developing and monitoring implementation of cyclical long-term college-wide plans. The goals in each 
             college-wide plan address long-term needs for educational programs and services and ensure the 
             college has appropriate resource to achieve the Strategic Plan goals and College mission, vision, and 
             values. The following college-wide plans are developed by planning committees on a cyclical basis:  
                 •   2020-23 Strategic Enrollment Management Plan developed by the Enrollment Management 
                     Oversight Committee 
                 •   2018-2021 Technology Plan developed by the Information Technology Advisory Committee 
                 •   2016-2041 Facilities Master Plan developed by the Facilities Advisory Committee 
                 •   2018 Integrated Energy Master Plan developed by the Facilities Advisory Committee 
                 •   2019-2022 Equal Employment Opportunity Plan developed by the Faculty and Staff Diversity 
                     Committee 
                 •   2019-2022 Student Equity Plan developed by the Student Equity Subcommittee 
                 •   2022-2025 Adult Education Consortium Plan developed by the Adult Education Subcommittee 
             A brief description of each plan can be found on the college-wide plans webpage of the College 
             Planning Council’s website.  
             Some planning committees, subcommittees, and taskforces that report to College Planning Council 
             are not charged with developing and implementing a college-wide plan, however their work is 
             directly linked to supporting the integrated planning process: 
                 •   Budget Advisory Committee: The Budget Advisory Committee works directly with the College 
                     Planning Council to coordinate budget processes in alignment with the College’s Annual 
                     Planning and Program Review (APPR) process. One of the primary functions of the committee 
                     is to use the College’s institutional priorities, established by the College Planning Council 
                     during the APPR process, to prepare recommendations for budget development. The 
                     institutional priorities are incorporated into the budget assumptions in both the tentative and 
                     adopted budgets and used by President’s Cabinet to prioritize resource requests for funding 
                     during the APPR process described in the following section. 
                 •   Grants Development Committee: The Grants Development Committee supports the alignment 
                     of grant funding with the College’s mission, Strategic Plan goals, and resource needs.  
                 •   Online Education Committee: The Online Education Committee establishes short and long-
                     term planning goals for online education initiatives in alignment with the Strategic Plan goals 
                     and provides input on the goals of the Information Technology Advisory Committee’s 
                     Technology Plan, as they pertain to online education technology.  
                 •   Student Success Committee: The Student Success Committee supports student success efforts 
                     in alignment with the Strategic Plan. The Adult Education, Student Equity, Equitable 
                     Placement and Success Subcommittee, and Strong Workforce Subcommittees report to the 
                                                                                                                        26 
              
              
                     Student Success Committee. As such, the Student Success Committee makes 
                     recommendations for the Adult Education Consortium Plan and Student Equity Plan, as well as 
                     provides input on equitable placement initiatives and Strong Workforce projects that support 
                     the Strategic Plan. The Committee also provides input and recommendations on college-wide 
                     student success initiatives that are implemented to support the Strategic Plan. 
                         o  Equitable Placement and Success Subcommittee: The Equitable Placement and Success 
                             Subcommittee provides leadership, coordination, and support for instructional areas 
                             regarding course placement in alignment with state and local policy and the College’s 
                             Strategic Plan to streamline the student experience, improve student learning, and 
                             accelerate student completion of their academic goals. 
                         o  Strong Workforce Subcommittee: The Strong Workforce Subcommittee provides 
                             recommendations on local Strong Workforce projects in alignment with the 
                             Chancellor’s Office Strong Workforce goals. The Subcommittee ensures that any 
                             recommendations for projects support progress toward accomplishment of the 
                             Strategic Plan goals, in addition to accomplishment of the Strong Workforce goals.  
             Annual Planning and Program Review Process 
             The College’s mission, vision, and values, as well as the Strategic Plan goals, strategies, and 
             measurable outcomes also provide a framework that guides the development of the goals, activities, 
             and resource requests in the Annual Planning and Program Review (APPR) process. The APPR process 
             is overseen by the College Planning Council in collaboration with the Academic Senate’s Department 
             Plan/Program Review Subcommittee and the Office of Institutional Effectiveness. This annual process 
             is directly tied to the College’s budget and resource allocation processes. The APPR process is cyclical 
             and consists of the following levels, which build upon one another: 
                 •   Instructional Program Planning and Review; Administrative and Student Services 
                     Department Planning and Review: The planning and program review process begins each fall 
                     with the development of instructional program plans/reviews and administrative and student 
                     services department plans/reviews. During this process, programs analyze SLO and student 
                     achievement data, while administrative and student services departments analyze Service 
                     Unit Outcome (SUO) data. Faculty and staff in each department reflect on progress toward 
                     goals from the previous year, and determine plans for the coming year. All program and 
                     department goals are aligned with the College’s Strategic Plan goals and mission. Faculty and 
                     staff in each department also have the opportunity to align their goals and activities directly 
                     to college-wide plan goals and strategies. Through this process, faculty and staff request 
                     financial resources needed by their departments to provide the necessary human, physical, 
                     and technological support necessary to complete activities and move their goals forward. 
                 •   School Level Planning: Following the submission of program and department plans/reviews, 
                     instructional and student services areas develop school-level plans, established by school 
                     planning groups using a similar template and data-informed process. School planning groups 
                     follow established charges and memberships approved by the CPC to ensure broad 
                     participation in school planning by managers, faculty, and staff in each school and to ensure 
                                                                                                                        27 
              
              
                     that a consistent process is followed by all school planning groups. School planning groups are 
                     expected to analyze progress on school goals from the previous year, review all program and 
                     department plans/reviews for their respective areas in relation to school level goals, and 
                     analyze student achievement and student learning data for each goal at the school level. 
                     Based on this analysis, school planning groups identify and prioritize activities in alignment 
                     with their school-level goals. Many of these activities arise from the program or department 
                     plans/reviews, but during the analysis of student achievement and student learning data, 
                     additional activities may arise that the school planning group agrees should be supported by 
                     the Dean and reflected in the school plan. Resource requests that are associated with making 
                     progress on the top five activities identified in each school plan to move forward the goals are 
                     prioritized to be moved forward to the next level of planning. 
                 •   Vice President Level Planning: School plans and non-instructional department plans are 
                     submitted to the appropriate Vice Presidents at the end of the fall semester so that they can 
                     begin developing Vice President level plans for the spring semester. The Vice Presidents each 
                     convene a Vice President level planning group in alignment with the Vice President level 
                     planning group charge and membership, which was developed and approved by the CPC. Each 
                     group is tri-chaired by the Vice President, an Academic Senate Executive Appointee, and a 
                     Classified Senate Executive Appointee, who are appointed at a fall CPC meeting each year. The 
                     Vice President level planning groups each have their own distinct membership, but all include 
                     a broad membership of faculty, classified staff, management, and students. Each Vice 
                     President level planning group is charged with reviewing data related to three-year metrics to 
                     measure three-year goals and the school-level or department-level plans to inform 
                     recommendations on the activities and resources that should be included in the Vice 
                     President level plan for the coming budget year.  
                 •   Institutional Priorities: When the Vice President plans are submitted, the College Planning 
                     Council holds a joint meeting with the Budget Advisory Committee. At this meeting, the Vice 
                     President level planning group tri-chairs present the Vice President level plans and the 
                     committees jointly set institutional priorities for the next fiscal year, which are included in the 
                     budget assumptions for the tentative and adopted budgets. The institutional priorities are 
                     guided by the College’s mission, aligned with the Strategic Plan goals, and informed by the 
                     Vice President level plan goals. Once the budget is finalized for the coming year, the 
                     President’s Cabinet meets to determine what will be funded from the prioritized Vice 
                     President level plan resource requests based on how closely they align with the institutional 
                     priorities. Final decisions are communicated back to the College Planning Council and Vice 
                     President areas in the fall via email through In the Loop and by the Vice Presidents to their 
                     areas.  
              
             The College Planning Council evaluates the efficacy of the Annual Planning and Program Review 
             process on a six-year cycle in alignment with the Strategic Plan cycle. The Department Plan/Program 
             Review Subcommittee of the Committee on Curriculum and Instruction utilizes the same evaluation 
             cycle to evaluate the efficacy of instructional program planning and review. See Appendix E and F for

        California Education Code Section 70901(e) 
        California Education Code, Section 70901(e) requires that governing boards of community college districts 
        establish minimum standards for governing procedures to ensure that faculty, staff, and students the right to 
        participate effectively in district and college governance. Governing boards must also establish minimum 
        standards for governing procedures to ensure that faculty, staff, and students have the opportunity to express 
        their opinions at the college-level and to ensure that these opinions are given every reasonable consideration. 
        This section of California Education Code also designates the right of academic senates to assume primary 
        responsibility for making recommendations in the areas of curriculum and academic standards. 
        Title 5 § 53203 of California Code of Regulations  
        Title 5 § 53203 states requirements for the “effective participation” of students and staff in the development 
        of recommendations to the governing board. This section also requires the governing board to “consult 
        collegially” with the academic senate (i.e., rely primarily upon the advice and judgement of the academic 
        senate or reach mutual agreement between the governing board/designee and representatives of the 
        academic senate) on academic and professional matters.  
         
        Title 5 § 53200 defines “academic and professional matters” as 11 matters related to policy development and 
        implementation. These have become known today as the 10+1:  
         
        1. Curriculum, including establishing prerequisites and placing courses within disciplines;  
        2. Degree and certificate requirements;  
        3. Grading policies;  
        4. Educational program development;  
        5. Standards or policies regarding student preparation and success;  
        6. District and college governance structures, as related to faculty roles;  
        7. Faculty roles and involvement in accreditation processes, including self-study and annual reports;  
        8. Policies for faculty professional development activities;  
        9. Processes for program review;  
        10. Processes for institutional planning and budget development;  
        11. Other academic and professional matters as are mutually agreed upon between the governing board and 
        the academic senate. This agreement means that faculty undertake these duties to consult collegially on the 
        10+1 as a part of their faculty obligation.  
         
        Assembly Bill 1725 
        Assembly Bill 1725 is comprehensive California community college reform legislation passed in 1988 that 
        covers community college mission, governance, finance, employment, accountability, staff diversity and staff 
                                                                                                                              33 
          
         
        development. This bill established the Academic Senate’s role as the college’s primary voice of the faculty in 
        providing recommendations to the governing board on academic and professional matters. Assembly Bill 1725 
        is operationalized in Title 5, as described in the section above.  
        Accreditation 
        Standard IV.A.2 requires that the college establish and implement policy and procedures that authorize 
        administrator, faculty, and staff participation in decision-making processes. This standard also explicitly states 
        that the policy must provide provisions for student participation and for the consideration of student views in 
        matters in which students have a direct and reasonable interest. This policy must specify how individuals can 
        bring forward ideas and work together on appropriate policy, planning, and participatory governance 
        committees. 
        Standard IV.A.3. requires that administrators and faculty, through policy and procedures, have a substantive 
        and clearly defined role in institutional governance and exercise a substantial voice in institutional planning, 
        policies, and budget that relate to their areas of responsibility and expertise. 
        Standard IV.A.4. requires that faculty and academic administrators, through policy and procedures, and 
        through well-defined structures, have the responsibility for recommendations on curriculum and student 
        learning programs and services. 
        Standard IV.A.5 requires that the institution (through the board and institutional governance) ensures that 
        relevant perspectives are considered, that decision-making is aligned with expertise and responsibility, and 
        that there is timely action on institutional plans, policies, curricular change, and other key considerations. 
        Standard IV.A.6 requires that processes for decision-making and the resulting decisions are documented and 
        widely communicated to the institution. 
        Standard IV.A.7 requires that the college’s leadership roles, institutional governance, and decision-making 
        policies and processes and regularly evaluated to assure their integrity and effectiveness. Results of these 
        evaluations should be widely communicated and used as the basis for improvement.  
                                                                     
                                                                     
                                                                     
                                                                     
                                                                     
                                                                     
                                                                                                                             34

                       Annual Planning and Program Review Evaluation Cycle 
        How often will the annual planning and program review evaluation occur? 
        In alignment with the College’s Strategic Plan cycle, the annual planning and program review evaluation will occur every 
        six years. Since evaluations previously occurred on an annual cycle, the initial multi-year cycle has been extended to 
        eight years in order to align with the College’s upcoming Strategic Planning cycle.  
        When will the evaluation cycle commence? 
        The evaluation cycle will begin with the 2020-2021 academic year. The first comprehensive evaluation in this cycle will 
        occur in 2027-2028.  
        What will be included in the annual planning and program review evaluation? 
        The evaluation will focus on the efficacy of all aspects of the annual planning and program review process including 
        timelines, annual planning structure (i.e., department, school, Vice President planning structure and planning group 
        purpose/functions), planning and program review templates, resource request prioritization processes, and Tableau 
        dashboards utilized in planning and program review. These aspects will be evaluated for planning at the department, 
        school, and Vice-President levels, as well as program review at the department level. Instructional program planning and 
        review will be evaluated through the Department Plan/Program Review Subcommittee (see Instructional Program 
        Planning and Review Cycle). 
        Why do we need a cycle of evaluation for our annual planning and program review processes? 
        Updating processes on an annual basis does not allow for sufficient time to determine whether or not the current 
        processes are effective. Furthermore, with constant changes on a yearly basis, there is potential for processes to 
        become confusing and inefficient, as individuals are asked to relearn new processes each year. Accreditation standards 
        also require regular review cycles for planning, program review, and resource allocation processes to ensure continuous 
        quality improvement of these processes. 
         How will annual planning and program review be evaluated? 
         Annual planning will be evaluated based on survey feedback from faculty, classified professionals, and managers who 
         participate in department, school, and Vice President-level planning and department-level program review. This survey 
        will be administered on an annual basis, with a comprehensive evaluation of the results during each evaluation period. 
        Focus groups may also be included in the evaluation if it is determined that further qualitative data is needed to inform 
        improvements.  
        Who will evaluate the annual planning and program review process? 
        The evaluation will be conducted by Institutional Effectiveness. Institutional Effectiveness will compile and analyze the 
        results of the evaluation, as well as identify recommendations for improvement based on results. These results and any 
        recommended improvements will be shared with the College Planning Council for further discussion and feedback prior 
        to any adjustments to the annual planning and program review process. 
        What updates can be made to the process or templates during the cycle? 
        While the process will undergo a comprehensive evaluation in alignment with the Strategic Plan cycle, aspects of the 
        process may be updated at any time during the cycle for the following reasons: 
                                                                                                                              35 
          
         
            •    Accreditation Standards, Title 5, and/or California Education Code were updated in ways that impact annual 
                 planning and program review 
             •   Errors in spelling, grammar, and/or minor functionality issues were identified in the templates and/or Tableau 
                 dashboards 
                                                                     
                                          
                                                                                                                              36

                           Instructional Program Plan and Review Evaluation Cycle 
        How often will the Instructional Program Plan and Review evaluation occur? 
        In alignment with the College’s Strategic Plan cycle, the Instructional Program Plan and Review evaluation will occur 
        every six years. Since evaluations previously occurred on an annual cycle, the initial multi-year cycle has been extended 
        to eight years in order to align with the College’s upcoming Strategic Planning cycle.  
        When will the evaluation cycle commence? 
        The evaluation cycle will begin with the 2020-2021 academic year. The first comprehensive evaluation will occur in 
        2027-2028. 
        What will be included in the Instructional Program Plan and Review evaluation? 
        The instructional program plan and review process (including timelines, training and workshops, resource documents, 
        etc.), the Program Plan and Review Template (including the resource request spreadsheet), the Supplemental Program 
        Review Template, and related Tableau Dashboards will be evaluated for their effectiveness in supporting faculty in 
        analyzing student achievement and learning data and utilizing this data to inform future plans to improve student 
        achievement and learning, as well as to inform resource requests. 
        Why do we need a cycle of evaluation for our planning and program review processes? 
        Updating processes on an annual basis does not allow for sufficient time to determine whether or not the current 
        processes are effective. Furthermore, with constant changes on a yearly basis, there is potential for processes to 
        become confusing and inefficient, as individuals are asked to relearn new processes each year. Accreditation standards 
        also require regular review cycles for planning, program review, and resource allocation processes to ensure continuous 
        quality improvement of these processes. 
        How will Instructional Program Planning and Review be evaluated? 
        Instructional program planning and review will be evaluated based on survey feedback from faculty who participate in 
        the annual planning and program review process. This survey will be administered on an annual basis, with a 
        comprehensive evaluation of the results every six years. Focus groups may also be included in the evaluation if it is 
        determined that further qualitative data is needed to inform improvements.  
        Who will evaluate the Instructional Program Plan and Review process? 
        The process will be evaluated by the Curriculum Chair, Department Plan/Program Review Subcommittee Chair, and SLO 
        Coordinator in collaboration with the Dean or Associate Dean of Academic Affairs and Institutional Effectiveness. Results 
        of the evaluation and any potential improvements will be shared with the Department Plan/Program Review 
        Subcommittee for further discussion and feedback prior to any modifications or adjustments to the program planning 
        and review process. 
        What updates can be made to the process or templates during the six-year cycle? 
        While the process, templates, and dashboards will undergo a comprehensive evaluation every six years, aspects of the 
        program planning and review processes, templates, or Tableau dashboards may be updated within the six-year time 
        frame for the following reasons: 
                                                                                                                              37 
          
         
            •    Accreditation Standards, Title 5, and/or California Education Code were updated in ways that impact 
                 instructional planning and program review 
            •    The Curriculum Committee has identified a needed modification to the templates based on updates to local 
                 curriculum processes and practices 
            •    Errors in spelling, grammar, and/or minor functionality issues were identified in the templates and/or Tableau 
                 dashboards

                                                           Appendix G 
                                     Participatory Governance Evaluation Cycle 
        How often will the participatory governance evaluation occur? 
        The participatory governance comprehensive evaluation will occur every six years, during the year in which the College’s 
        new Strategic Plan is developed. An additional evaluation will occur at the mid-point in the six-year cycle. 
        When will the evaluation cycle commence? 
        The first comprehensive evaluation will be conducted in fall 2021. The mid-point evaluation will occur in fall 2024.  
        What will be included in the participatory governance evaluation? 
        The evaluation will focus on all aspects of the President’s Leadership Council and College Planning Council committee 
        structure, communication, processes, and procedures to ensure their integrity and effectiveness. The evaluation will 
        include feedback from all chairs and members who participate on these councils, committees, subcommittees, and 
        taskforces, as well as include feedback from all college-wide constituents who do not participate directly in the 
        participatory governance structure.  
        Why do we need a cycle of evaluation for our participatory governance structure and processes? 
        A cycle of evaluation is needed for participatory governance to determine areas of improvement, as well as determine 
        whether or not changes made as a result of the evaluation ultimately improve the participatory governance structure, 
        communication, processes, and practices. An evaluation that occurs every six years, with a mid-point evaluation ensures 
        sufficient time to evaluate whether any changes made have resulted in improvements to participatory governance 
        effectiveness and integrity. In addition, the cycle ensures that results can be utilized to inform the development of the 
        College’s Strategic Plan and ensure the effectiveness of the implementation of the plan through the participatory 
        governance committee structure. 
        How will participatory governance be evaluated? 
        Participatory Governance will be evaluated based on survey feedback from full and part-time faculty, classified 
        professionals, students, and administrators who participate as chairs, members, and/or resources of participatory 
        governance councils, committees, subcommittees, and taskforces, as well as survey feedback from all constituent 
        groups at-large. Focus groups may also be included in the evaluation if it is determined that further qualitative data is 
        needed to inform improvements.  
        Who will evaluate the participatory governance process? 
        The evaluation will be developed and conducted through the College Planning Council with support from Institutional 
        Effectiveness. Institutional Effectiveness will compile the results of the evaluation. These results will be shared with the 
        College Planning Council for further discussion and feedback to determine actions to take to improve the participatory 
        governance structure, communication, processes, and practices.  
        What updates can be made to the process or structure during the cycle? 
        While the process will undergo a comprehensive evaluation every six years and at the mid-point during this cycle, the 
        College Planning Council may modify aspects of the participatory governance structure, communication, processes, or 
        practices at any time during the cycle for the following reasons: 
                                                                                                                              39 
          
         
            •    Accreditation Standards, Title 5, and/or California Education Code were updated in ways that impact the 
                 participatory governance 
             •   New college-wide initiatives have arisen at LBCC or the Chancellor’s Office that require new or modified 
                 councils, committees, subcommittees, or taskforces 
             •   Overlap in committee functions or a lack of need for a committee identified by the College Planning Council that 
                 requires committee consolidation or inactivation 
             •   A gap in communication, committee structure, processes and/or practices is identified that was not identified in 
                 the evaluation results and needs to be remedied for improvement 
             •   The Institutional Planning and Participatory Governance Handbook workgroup has brought forward
