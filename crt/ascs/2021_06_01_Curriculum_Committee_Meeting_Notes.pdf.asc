       6  Grade Reading – Making Meaning: Mrs. Sarah Raber (click for full presentation) 
                                                         th
       Mrs. Raber presented a Program Improvement proposal for 6  grade Analysis of Fiction and Non-fiction.  The Reading 
       program at the elementary level include Making Meaning as the curriculum resource. The proposal calls for an 
       extension of K-5 implementation to K-6. The curriculum materials will be funded through ESSER grant, and professional 
       development costs will be funded through Title II. 
       Dr. Bolton asked if there will be an on-going cost of this program and how it will be funded in future years. Mrs. Raber 
       responded that the on-going cost is the cost of students’ consumables and will be accounted for in the 
       Reading/Language Arts (RELA) budget. 
       Mrs. Banis-Clemens asked how long it will take for changes to be reflected in Pennridge educational ratings since major 
       RELA curriculum programs have been implemented at the elementary schools.  Dr. Bolton responded that elementary 
       students have already shown gains from elementary RELA curriculum renewal. The district goal is for students to be on 
       grade level for reading by the end of the third grade. 
       All Board members in attendance agreed to move the proposal to motion at the June 16, 2021 School Board meeting. 
       Curriculum Renewal and Mapping: Dr. Kathy Scheid and Curriculum Supervisors  
       Dr. Scheid stated that she was proud to present four units of study with curriculum supervisors and Pennridge teachers. 
       Curriculum mapping professional development was supported by Dr. Heidi Hayes-Jacobs and Dr. Bena Kallick. Secondary 
       teachers from different departments shared their curriculum writing experiences and positive changes in teaching and 
       learning (watch video). 
       Dr. Scheid presented Pennridge vision for curriculum development and guidelines for teaching and learning. 
                                                                                                    th
       Mrs. Raber and two High School teachers, Mrs. Jessica Saylor and Mrs. Julia Grimshaw presented a RELA unit – 10  grade 
       American Literature. 
       Mrs. Banis-Clemens asked if the curriculum units could be accessed in Atlas. Dr. Scheid responded that the pdf files were 
       shared with the Board members.  The community will be able to access parts of the curriculum units via Atlas later in the 
       summer or early Fall. 
                                                                         th
       Mrs. Boletta and Central Middle School teacher, Mrs. Stefani Scholz, presented 7  grade Science unit – Genetics. 
       Mr. Veverka and Central Middle School teacher, Mrs. Amy Welter, presented Social Studies unit – Shaping the American 
       Story. 
       Mr. Vogel presented two units – Math 8 and Personal Finance with two secondary teachers, Mrs. Sandy Miller, Central 
       Middle School and Mrs. Kate O’Boyle, Pennridge High School. 
       Mrs. Banis-Clemens commented that she would like to see Personal Finance as a graduation requirement since it teaches 
       students life skills and helps them make smart financial decisions in future.  Dr. Scheid responded that work is currently 
       underway in that regard. 
       Dr. Bolton thanked teachers and curriculum supervisors for their work on curriculum writing.  He made note that once 
       courses are approved and adopted, there will be public access to some information in Atlas. 
    Dr. Bolton asked Dr. Scheid if Critical Race Theory is part of the conversation during curriculum work.  Dr. Scheid responded 
    that it was not and will not be part of the curriculum at Pennridge. 
    DEI Update: Dr. Cheri Derr (click for full presentation) 
    Dr. Derr introduced our DEI consultant, Mrs. Laura Lomax, and High School teacher, Mrs. Megan Thomas, who joined her 
    for the DEI Update presentation and DEI Guidebook overview. 
    Mrs. Cullen stated that recourses need to reflect diverse opinions and different points of view. The discussion on DEI 
    guidelines, resources, and DEI Committee representation took place among School Board members. 
    Dr. Bolton stated that he was proud of the work that DEI team has done. He also commented that the DEI documents are 
    in  draft  form and that revisions are expected. He also explained that the curriculum resources teachers use in the 
    classrooms must be approved by the supervisors, and clarified the difference between district-wide professional learning 
    and PLT sessions.  
    Elementary Trimesters and Report Cards: Dr. Anthony Rybarczyk (click for full presentation) 
    Dr. Rybarczyk presented an overview of the work done by the Elementary Progress Reporting Committee over the last 
    three months. 
    Mr. Krause thanked Dr. Rybarczyk for the work done on progress reporting. He asked if the comments on the reports will 
    still be pre-determined. Dr. Rybarczyk answered that teachers want to provide parents with students’ academic and social 
    performance. The comment section of the report cards will be further discussed, and it might be a combination of pre-
    determined statements and other comments allowing teachers to express their feedback. 
    Mr. Wurz asked what will be done if parents want to conference with teachers after report cards are received. Dr. 
    Rybarczyk answered that the pilot will help to make further decisions.  
    Mrs. Walters shared that she had a positive experience with trimester report cards in a different school district.  She 
    believes it will be a great pilot from a teacher’s perspective. 
    Mrs. Banis-Clemens commented that parents will receive sufficient feedback from teachers from two conferences and 
    ongoing communications. Dr. Rybarczyk agreed with her and added that the new reports will provide broader information 
    on student performance.
