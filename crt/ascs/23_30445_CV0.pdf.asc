                    Before Clement, Elrod, and Willett, Circuit Judges. 
                    Per Curiam:  
                           A group of social-media users and two states allege that numerous 
                    federal officials coerced social-media platforms into censoring certain social-
                    media content, in violation of the First Amendment. We agree, but only as to 
                    some of those officials. So, we AFFIRM in part, REVERSE in part, 
                    VACATE the injunction in part, and MODIFY the injunction in part.

                                                     No. 23-30445 
                                                         I. 
                            For the last few years—at least since the 2020 presidential 
                     transition—a group of federal officials has been in regular contact with nearly 
                     every major American social-media company about the spread of 
                     “misinformation” on their platforms. In their concern, those officials—
                     hailing from the White House, the CDC, the FBI, and a few other agencies—
                     urged the platforms to remove disfavored content and accounts from their 
                     sites. And, the platforms seemingly complied. They gave the officials access 
                     to an expedited reporting system, downgraded or removed flagged posts, and 
                     deplatformed users. The platforms also changed their internal policies to 
                     capture more flagged content and sent steady reports on their moderation 
                     activities to the officials. That went on through the COVID-19 pandemic, the 
                     2022 congressional election, and continues to this day.  
                            Enter this lawsuit. The Plaintiffs—three doctors, a news website, a 
                                                         1
                     healthcare activist, and two states —had posts and stories removed or 
                     downgraded by the platforms. Their content touched on a host of divisive 
                     topics like the COVID-19 lab-leak theory, pandemic lockdowns, vaccine side-
                     effects, election fraud, and the Hunter Biden laptop story. The Plaintiffs 
                     maintain that although the platforms stifled their speech, the government 
                     officials were the ones pulling the strings—they “coerced, threatened, and 
                     pressured [the] social-media platforms to censor [them]” through private 
                            _____________________ 
                            1 Specifically, the Plaintiffs are (1) Jayanta Bhattacharya and Martin Kulldorff, two 
                     epidemiologists who co-wrote the Great Barrington Declaration, an article criticizing 
                     COVID-19 lockdowns; (2) Jill Hines, an activist who spearheaded “Reopen Louisiana”; 
                     (3) Aaron Kheriaty, a psychiatrist who opposed lockdowns and vaccine mandates; (4) Jim 
                     Hoft, the owner of the Gateway Pundit, a once-deplatformed news site; and (5) Missouri 
                     and Louisiana, who assert their sovereign and quasi-sovereign interests in protecting their 
                     citizens and the free flow of information. Bhattacharya, Kulldorff, Hines, Kheriaty, and 
                     Hoft, collectively, are referred to herein as the “Individual Plaintiffs.” Missouri and 
                     Louisiana, together, are referred to as the “State Plaintiffs.”

                 Case: 23-30445      Document: 00516889176     Page: 3     Date Filed: 09/08/2023
                                                     No. 23-30445 
                                                                                     2
                     communications and legal threats. So, they sued the officials  for First 
                     Amendment violations and asked the district court to enjoin the officials’ 
                     conduct. In response, the officials argued that they only “sought to mitigate 
                     the hazards of online misinformation” by “calling attention to content” that 
                     violated the “platforms’ policies,” a form of permissible government speech. 
                            The district court agreed with the Plaintiffs and granted preliminary 
                     injunctive relief. In reaching that decision, it reviewed the conduct of several 
                     federal offices, but only enjoined the White House, the Surgeon General, the 
                     CDC, the FBI, the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases 
                     (NIAID), the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA), and 
                     the Department of State. We briefly review—per the district court’s order 
                     and the record—those officials’ conduct. 
                                                         A.  
                            Considering their close cooperation and the ministerial ecosystem, we 
                     take the White House and the Surgeon General’s office together. Officials 
                     from both offices began communicating with social media companies—
                            _____________________ 
                            2 The defendant-officials include (1) the President; (2) his Press Secretary; (3) the 
                     Surgeon General; (4) the Department of Health and Human Services; (5) the HHS’s 
                     Director; (6) Anthony Fauci in his capacity as the Director of the National Institute of 
                     Allergy and Infectious Diseases; (7) the NIAID; (8) the Centers for Disease Control; (9) 
                     the CDC’s Digital Media Chief; (10) the Census Bureau; (11) the Senior Advisor for 
                     Communications at the Census Bureau; (12) the Department of Commerce; (13) the 
                     Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security; (14) the Senior Counselor to the 
                     Secretary of the DHS; (15) the DHS; (16) the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security 
                     Agency; (17) the Director of CISA; (18) the Department of Justice; (19) the Federal Bureau 
                     of Investigation; (20) a special agent of the FBI; (21) a section chief of the FBI; (22) the 
                     Food and Drug Administration; (23) the Director of Social Media at the FDA; (24) the 
                     Department of State; (25) the Department of Treasury; (26) the Department of 
                     Commerce; and (27) the Election Assistance Commission. The Plaintiffs also sued a host 
                     of various advisors, officials, and deputies in the White House, the FDA, the CDC, the 
                     Census Bureau, the HHS, and CISA. Note that some of these officials were not enjoined 
                     and, therefore, are not mentioned again in this opinion. 
                                                          3 
         Case: 23-30445      Document: 00516889176     Page: 4     Date Filed: 09/08/2023
                          No. 23-30445 
          including Facebook, Twitter (now known as “X”), YouTube, and Google—
          in early 2021. From the outset, that came with requests to take down flagged 
          content. In one email, a White House official told a platform to take a post 
          down “ASAP,” and instructed it to “keep an eye out for tweets that fall in 
          this same [] genre” so that they could be removed, too. In another, an official 
          told a platform to “remove [an] account immediately”—he could not “stress 
          the degree to which this needs to be resolved immediately.” Often, those 
          requests for removal were met. 
              But, the White House officials did not only flag content. Later that 
          year, they started monitoring the platforms’ moderation activities, too. In 
          that vein, the officials asked for—and received—frequent updates from the 
          platforms. Those updates revealed, however, that the platforms’ policies 
          were not clear-cut and did not always lead to content being demoted. So, the 
          White House pressed the platforms. For example, one White House official 
          demanded more details and data on Facebook’s internal policies at least 
          twelve times, including to ask what was being done to curtail “dubious” or 
          “sensational” content, what “interventions” were being taken, what 
          “measurable impact” the platforms’ moderation policies had, “how much 
          content [was] being demoted,” and what “misinformation” was not being 
          downgraded. In one instance, that official lamented that flagging did not 
          “historically mean[] that [a post] was removed.” In another, the same official 
          told a platform that they had “been asking [] pretty directly, over a series of 
          conversations” for “what actions [the platform has] been taking to mitigate” 
          vaccine hesitancy, to end the platform’s “shell game,” and that they were 
          “gravely concerned” the platform was “one of the top drivers of vaccine 
          hesitancy.” Another time, an official asked why a flagged post was “still up” 
          as it had “gotten pretty far.” The official queried “how does something like 
          that happen,” and maintained that “I don’t think our position is that you 
          should remove vaccine hesitant stuff,” but “slowing it down seems 
                            4 
         Case: 23-30445      Document: 00516889176     Page: 5     Date Filed: 09/08/2023
                          No. 23-30445 
          reasonable.” Always, the officials asked for more data and stronger 
          “intervention[s].” 
              From the beginning, the platforms cooperated with the White House. 
          One company made an employee “available on a regular basis,” and another 
          gave the officials access to special tools like a “Partner Support Portal” 
          which “ensure[d]” that their requests were “prioritized automatically.” 
          They all attended regular meetings. But, once White House officials began to 
          demand more from the platforms, they seemingly stepped-up their efforts to 
          appease the officials. When there was confusion, the platforms would call to 
          “clear up” any “misunderstanding[s]” and provide data detailing their 
          moderation activities. When there was doubt, they met with the officials, 
          tried to “partner” with them, and assured them that they were actively trying 
          to “remove the most harmful COVID-19 misleading information.” At times, 
          their responses bordered on capitulation. One platform employee, when 
          pressed about not “level[ing]” with the White House, told an official that he 
          would “continue to do it to the best of [his] ability, and [he will] expect [the 
          official] to hold [him] accountable.” Similarly, that platform told the Surgeon 
          General that “[w]e’re [] committed to addressing the [] misinformation that 
          you’ve called on us to address.” The platforms were apparently eager to stay 
          in the officials’ good graces. For example, in an effort to get ahead of a 
          negative news story, Facebook preemptively reached out to the White House 
          officials to tell them that the story “doesn’t accurately represent the problem 
          or the solutions we have put in place.” 
              The officials were often unsatisfied. They continued to press the 
          platforms on the topic of misinformation throughout 2021, especially when 
          they seemingly veered from the officials’ preferred course. When Facebook 
          did not take a prominent pundit’s “popular post[]” down, a White House 
          official asked “what good is” the reporting system, and signed off with “last 
          time we did this dance, it ended in an insurrection.” In another message, an 
                            5 
         Case: 23-30445      Document: 00516889176     Page: 6     Date Filed: 09/08/2023
                          No. 23-30445 
          official sent Facebook a Washington Post article detailing the platform’s 
          alleged failures to limit misinformation with the statement “[y]ou are hiding 
          the ball.” A day later, a second official replied that they felt Facebook was 
          not “trying to solve the problem” and the White House was 
          “[i]nternally . . . considering our options on what to do about it.” In another 
          instance, an official—demanding “assurances” that a platform was taking 
          action—likened the platform’s alleged inaction to the 2020 election, which 
          it “helped increase skepticism in, and an insurrection which was plotted, in 
          large part, on your platform.” 
              To ensure that problematic content was being taken down, the 
          officials—via meetings and emails—pressed the platforms to change their 
          moderation policies. For example, one official emailed Facebook a document 
          recommending changes to the platform’s internal policies, including to its 
          deplatforming and downgrading systems, with the note that “this is 
          circulating around the building and informing thinking.” In another instance, 
          the Surgeon General asked the platforms to take part in an “all-of-society” 
          approach to COVID by implementing stronger misinformation 
          “monitoring” programs, redesigning their algorithms to “avoid amplifying 
          misinformation,” targeting “repeat offenders,” “[a]mplify[ing] 
          communications from trusted . . . experts,” and “[e]valuat[ing] the 
          effectiveness of internal policies.” 
              The platforms apparently yielded. They not only continued to take 
          down content the officials flagged, and provided requested data to the White 
          House,  but they also changed their moderation policies expressly in 
          accordance with the officials’ wishes. For example, one platform said it knew 
          its “position on [misinformation] continues to be a particular concern” for 
          the White House, and said it was “making a number of changes” to capture 
          and downgrade a “broader set” of flagged content. The platform noted that, 
          in line with the officials’ requests, it would “make sure that these additional 
                            6 
         Case: 23-30445      Document: 00516889176     Page: 7     Date Filed: 09/08/2023
                          No. 23-30445 
          [changes] show results—the stronger demotions in particular should deliver 
          real impact.” Another time, a platform represented that it was going to 
          change its moderation policies and activities to fit with express guidance from 
          the CDC and other federal officials. Similarly, one platform noted that it was 
          taking down flagged content which seemingly was not barred under previous 
          iterations of its moderation policy. 
              Relatedly, the platforms enacted several changes that coincided with 
          the officials’ aims shortly after meeting with them. For example, one 
          platform sent out a post-meeting list of “commitments” including a policy 
          “change[]” “focused on reducing the virality” of anti-vaccine content even 
          when it “does not contain actionable misinformation.” On another occasion, 
          one platform listed “policy updates . . . regarding repeat misinformation” 
          after meeting with the Surgeon General’s office and signed off that “[w]e 
          think there’s considerably more we can do in partnership with you and your 
          teams to drive behavior.” 
              Even when the platforms did not expressly adopt changes, though, 
          they removed flagged content that did not run afoul of their policies. For 
          example, one email from Facebook stated that although a group of posts did 
          not “violate our community standards,” it “should have demoted them 
          before they went viral.” In another instance, Facebook recognized that a 
          popular video did not qualify for removal under its policies but promised that 
          it was being “labeled” and “demoted” anyway after the officials flagged it. 
              At the same time, the platforms often boosted the officials’ activities 
          at their request. For example, for a vaccine “roll out,” the officials shared 
          “what [t]he admin’s plans are” and “what we’re seeing as the biggest 
          headwinds” that the platforms could help with. The platforms “welcome[d] 
          the opportunity” to lend a hand. Similarly, when a COVID vaccine was 
          halted, the White House asked a platform to—through 
                            7 
         Case: 23-30445      Document: 00516889176     Page: 8     Date Filed: 09/08/2023
                          No. 23-30445 
          “hard . . . intervention[s]”  and  “algorithmic amplification”—“make sure 
          that a favorable review reaches as many people” as possible to stem the 
          spread of alleged misinformation. The officials also asked for labeling of posts 
          and a 24-hour “report-back” period to monitor the public’s response. Again, 
          the platforms obliged—they were “keen to amplify any messaging you want 
          us to project,” i.e., “the right messages.” Another time, a platform told the 
          White House it was “eager” to help with vaccine efforts, including by 
          “amplify[ing]” content. Similarly, a few months later, after the White House 
          shared some of the “administration’s plans” for vaccines in an industry 
          meeting, Facebook reiterated that it was “committed to the effort of 
          amplifying the rollout of [those] vaccines.” 
              Still, White House officials felt the platforms were not doing enough. 
          One told a platform that it “remain[ed] concerned” that the platform was 
          encouraging vaccine hesitancy, which was a “concern that is shared at the 
          highest (and I mean highest) levels of the [White House].” So, the official 
          asked for the platform’s “road map to improvement” and said it would be 
          “good to have from you all . . . a deeper dive on [misinformation] reduction.” 
          Another time, the official responded to a moderation report by flagging a 
          user’s account and saying it is “[h]ard to take any of this seriously when 
          you’re actively promoting anti-vaccine pages.” The platform subsequently 
          “removed” the account “entirely” from its site, detailed new changes to the 
          company’s moderation policies, and told the official that “[w]e clearly still 
          have work to do.” The official responded that “removing bad information” 
          is “one of the easy, low-bar things you guys [can] do to make people like me 
          think you’re taking action.” The official emphasized that other platforms had 
          “done pretty well” at demoting non-sanctioned information, and said “I 
          don’t know why you guys can’t figure this out.” 
              The officials’ frustrations reached a boiling point in July of 2021. That 
          month, in a joint press conference with the Surgeon General’s office, the 
                            8 
         Case: 23-30445      Document: 00516889176     Page: 9     Date Filed: 09/08/2023
                          No. 23-30445 
          White House Press Secretary said that the White House “expect[s] more” 
          from the platforms, including that they “consistently take action against 
          misinformation” and “operate with greater transparency and 
          accountability.” Specifically, the White House called on platforms to adopt 
          “proposed changes,” including limiting the reach of “misinformation,” 
          creating a “robust enforcement strategy,” taking “faster action” because 
          they were taking “too long,” and amplifying “quality information.” The 
          Press Secretary said that the White House “engag[es] with [the platforms] 
          regularly and they certainly understand what our asks are.” She also 
          expressly noted that several accounts, despite being flagged by the White 
          House, “remain active” on a few platforms. 
              The Surgeon General also spoke at the press conference. He said the 
          platforms were “one of the biggest obstacles” to controlling the COVID 
          pandemic because they had “enabled misinformation to poison” public 
          discourse and “have extraordinary reach.” He labeled social-media-based 
          misinformation an “urgent public health threat[]” that was “literally 
          costing . . . lives.” He asked social-media companies to “operate with greater 
          transparency and accountability,” “monitor misinformation more closely,” 
          and “consistently take action against misinformation super-spreaders on 
          their platforms.” The Surgeon General contemporaneously issued a public 
          advisory “calling out social media platforms” and saying they “have a role to 
          play to improve [] health outcomes.” The next day, President Biden said that 
          the platforms were “killing people” by not acting on misinformation. Then, 
          a few days later, a White House official said they were “reviewing” the legal 
          liability of platforms—noting “the president speak[s] very aggressively 
          about” that—because “they should be held accountable.” 
              The platforms responded with total compliance. Their answer was 
          four-fold. First, they capitulated to the officials’ allegations. The day after 
          the President spoke, Facebook asked what it could do to “get back to a good 
                            9 
        Case: 23-30445      Document: 00516889176     Page: 10     Date Filed: 09/08/2023
                          No. 23-30445 
          place” with the White House. It sought to “better understand . . . what the 
          White House expects from us on misinformation going forward.” Second, 
          the platforms changed their internal policies. Facebook reached out to see 
          “how we can be more transparent,” comply with the officials’ requests, and 
          “deescalate” any tension. Others fell in line, too—YouTube and Google told 
          an official that they were “working on [it]” and relayed the “steps they are 
          currently taking” to do better. A few days later, Facebook told the Surgeon 
          General that “[w]e hear your call for us to do more,” and wanted to “make 
          sure [he] saw the steps [it took]” to “adjust policies on what we are removing 
          with respect to misinformation,” including “expand[ing] the group of false 
          claims” that it removes. That included the officials’ “specific 
          recommendations for improvement,” and the platform “want[ed] to make 
          sure to keep [the Surgeon General] informed of [its] work on each.” 
              Third, the platforms began taking down content and deplatforming 
          users they had not previously targeted. For example, Facebook started 
          removing information posted by the “disinfo dozen”—a group of influencers 
          identified as problematic by the White House—despite earlier 
          representations that those users were not in violation of their policies. In 
          general, the platforms had pushed back against deplatforming users in the 
          past, but that changed. Facebook also made other pages that “had not yet 
          met their removal thresholds[] more difficult to find on our platform,” and 
          promised to send updates and take more action. A month later, members of 
          the disinfo dozen were deplatformed across several sites. Fourth, the 
          platforms continued to amplify or assist the officials’ activities, such as a 
          vaccine “booster” campaign. 
              Still, the White House kept the pressure up. Officials continuously 
          expressed that they would keep pushing the platforms to act. And, in the 
          following year, the White House Press Secretary stressed that, in regard to 
          problematic users on the platforms, the “President has long been concerned 
                            10 
        Case: 23-30445      Document: 00516889176     Page: 11     Date Filed: 09/08/2023
                          No. 23-30445 
          about the power of large” social media companies and that they “must be 
          held accountable for the harms they cause.” She continued that the President 
          “has been a strong supporter of fundamental reforms to achieve that goal, 
          including reforms to [S]ection 230, enacting antitrust reforms, requiring 
          more transparency, and more.” Per the officials, their back-and-forth with 
          the platforms continues to this day.  
                            B.  
              Next, we turn to the CDC. Much like the White House officials, the 
          CDC tried to “engage on a [] regular basis” with the platforms. They also 
          received reports on the platforms’ moderation activities and policy updates. 
          And, like the other officials, the CDC also flagged content for removal that 
          was subsequently taken down. In one email, an official mentioned sixteen 
          posts and stated, “[W]e are seeing a great deal of misinfo [] that we wanted 
          to flag for you all.” In another email, CDC officials noted that flagged content 
          had been removed. And, the CDC actively sought to promote its officials’ 
          views over others. For example, they asked “what [was] being done on the 
          amplification-side” of things. 
              Unlike the other officials, though, the CDC officials also provided 
          direct guidance to the platforms on the application of the platforms’ internal 
          policies and moderation activities. They did so in three ways. First, CDC 
          officials authoritatively told the platforms what was (and was not) 
          misinformation. For example, in meetings—styled as “Be On the Lookout” 
          alerts—officials educated the platforms on “misinformation[] hot topics.” 
          Second, CDC officials asked for, or at least encouraged, harmonious changes 
          to the platforms’ moderation policies. One platform noted that “[a]s soon as 
          the CDC updates [us],” it would change information on its website to comply 
          with the officials’ views.  In that same email, the platform said it was 
          expanding its “misinfo policies” and it was “able to make this change based 
                            11 
        Case: 23-30445      Document: 00516889176     Page: 12     Date Filed: 09/08/2023
                          No. 23-30445 
          on the conversation we had last week with the CDC.” In another email, a 
          platform noted “several updates to our COVID-19 Misinformation and 
          Harm policy based on your inputs.” Third, through its guidance, the CDC 
          outright directed the platforms to take certain actions. In one post-meeting 
          email, an official said that “as mentioned on the call, any contextual 
          information that can be added to posts” on some alleged “disinformation” 
          “could be very effective.”  
              Ultimately, the CDC’s guidance informed, if not directly affected, the 
          platforms’ moderation decisions. The platforms sought answers from the 
          officials as to whether certain controversial claims were “true or false” and 
          whether related posts should be taken down as misleading. The CDC officials 
          obliged, directing the platforms as to what was or was not misinformation. 
          Such designations directly controlled the platforms’ decision-making 
          process for the removal of content. One platform noted that “[t]here are 
          several claims that we will be able to remove as soon as the CDC debunks 
          them; until then, we are unable to remove them.”  
                            C. 
              Next, we consider the conduct of the FBI officials. The agency’s 
          officials regularly met with the platforms at least since the 2020 election. In 
          these meetings, the FBI shared “strategic information with [] social-media 
          companies” to alert them to misinformation trends in the lead-up to federal 
          elections. For example, right before the 2022 congressional election, the FBI 
          tipped the platforms off to “hack and dump” operations from “state-
          sponsored actors” that would spread misinformation through their sites. In 
          another instance, they alerted the platforms to the activities and locations of 
          “Russian troll farms.” The FBI apparently acquired this information from 
          ongoing investigations. 
                            12 
        Case: 23-30445      Document: 00516889176     Page: 13     Date Filed: 09/08/2023
                          No. 23-30445 
              Per their operations, the FBI monitored the platforms’ moderation 
          policies, and asked for detailed assessments during their regular meetings. 
          The platforms apparently changed their moderation policies in response to 
          the FBI’s debriefs. For example, some platforms changed their “terms of 
          service” to be able to tackle content that was tied to hacking operations. 
              But, the FBI’s activities were not limited to purely foreign threats. In 
          the build up to federal elections, the FBI set up “command” posts that would 
          flag concerning content and relay developments to the platforms. In those 
          operations, the officials also targeted domestically sourced “disinformation” 
          like posts that stated incorrect poll hours or mail-in voting procedures. 
          Apparently, the FBI’s flagging operations across-the-board led to posts being 
          taken down 50% of the time.  
                            D. 
              Finally, we briefly discuss the remaining offices, namely the NIAID, 
          CISA, and the State Department. Generally speaking, the NIAID did not 
          have regular contact with the platforms or flag content. Instead, NIAID 
          officials were—as evidenced by internal emails—concerned with “tak[ing] 
          down” (i.e., discrediting) opposing scientific or policy views. On that front, 
          Director Anthony Fauci publicly spoke in favor of certain ideas (e.g., COVID 
          lockdowns) and against others (e.g., the lab-leak theory). In doing so, NIAID 
          officials appeared on podcasts and livestreams on some of the platforms. 
          Apparently, the platforms subsequently demoted posts that echoed or 
          supported the discredited views. 
              CISA and the State Department, on the other hand, both 
          communicated directly with the platforms. The State Department hosted 
          meetings that were meant to “facilitate [] communication” with the 
          platforms. In those meetings, they educated the platforms on the “tools and 
          techniques” that “malign” or “foreign propaganda actors” (e.g., terrorist 
                            13 
        Case: 23-30445      Document: 00516889176     Page: 14     Date Filed: 09/08/2023
                          No. 23-30445 
          groups, China) were using to spread misinformation. Generally, the State 
          Department officials did not flag content, suggest policy changes, or 
          reciprocally receive data during those meetings. 
              CISA, however, did flag content. Beyond holding regular industry 
          meetings with the platforms, CISA officials engaged in “switchboarding” 
          operations, meaning they acted as an intermediary for a third-party group by 
          forwarding flagged content from them to the platforms. For example, during 
          a federal election, CISA officials would receive “something on social media 
          that [local election officials] deemed to be disinformation aimed at their 
          jurisdiction” and, in turn, CISA would “share [that] with the appropriate 
          social media compan[y].” In switchboarding, CISA officials worked 
          alongside the Center for Internet Security and the Election Integrity Project, 
          two private organizations. The officials’ actions apparently led to content 
          being removed or demoted by the recipient platforms. 
                           *   *   * 
              Relying on the above record, the district court concluded that the 
          officials, via both private and public channels, asked the platforms to remove 
          content, pressed them to change their moderation policies, and threatened 
          them—directly and indirectly—with legal consequences if they did not 
          comply. And, it worked—that “unrelenting pressure” forced the platforms 
          to act and take down users’ content. Notably, though, those actions were not 
          limited to private actors. Accounts run by state officials were often subject to 
          censorship, too. For example, one platform removed a post by the Louisiana 
          Department of Justice—which depicted citizens testifying against public 
          policies regarding COVID—for violating its “medical misinformation 
          policy” by “spread[ing] medical misinformation.” In another instance, a 
          platform took down a Louisiana state legislator’s post discussing COVID 
          vaccines.  Similarly, one platform removed several videos, namely 
                            14 
        Case: 23-30445      Document: 00516889176     Page: 15     Date Filed: 09/08/2023
                          No. 23-30445 
          testimonials regarding COVID, posted by St. Louis County. So, the district 
          court reasoned, the Plaintiffs were “likely to succeed” on their claim because 
          when the platforms moderated content, they were acting under the coercion 
          (or significant encouragement) of government officials, in violation of the 
          First Amendment, at the expense of both private and governmental actors. 
              In addition, the court found that considerations of equity weighed in 
          favor of an injunction because of the clear need to safeguard the Plaintiffs’ 
          First Amendment rights. Finally, the court ruled that the Plaintiffs had 
          standing to bring suit under several different theories, including direct First 
          Amendment censorship and, for the State Plaintiffs, quasi-sovereign 
          interests as well. Consequently, the district court entered an injunction 
          against the officials barring them from an assortment of activities, including 
          “meeting with,” “communicat[ing]” with, or “flagging content” for social-
          media companies “for the purpose of urging, encouraging, pressuring, or 
          inducing in any manner the removal, deletion, suppression, or reduction of 
          content containing protected free speech.” The officials appeal.  
                            II. 
              We review the district court’s standing determination de novo. 
          Freedom Path, Inc. v. Internal Revenue Serv., 913 F.3d 503, 507 (5th Cir. 2019). 
          “We review a preliminary injunction for abuse of discretion, reviewing 
          findings of fact for clear error and conclusions of law de novo. Whether an 
          injunction fulfills the mandates of Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(d) is a question of law 
          we review de novo.” Louisiana v. Biden, 45 F.4th 841, 845 (5th Cir. 2022) 
          (internal quotation marks and citation omitted).  
                            III. 
              We begin with standing. To establish Article III standing, the Plaintiffs 
          bear the burden to show “[1] an injury in fact [2] that is fairly traceable to the 
          challenged action of the defendant and [3] likely to be redressed by [their] 
                            15 
        Case: 23-30445      Document: 00516889176     Page: 16     Date Filed: 09/08/2023
                          No. 23-30445 
          requested relief.” Stringer v. Whitley, 942 F.3d 715, 720 (5th Cir. 2019) (citing 
          Lujan v. Defs. of Wildlife, 504 U.S. 555, 560–61 (1992)). Because the Plaintiffs 
          seek injunctive relief, the injury-in-fact and redressability requirements 
          “intersect[]” and therefore the Plaintiffs must “demonstrat[e] a continuing 
          injury or threatened future injury,” not a past one. Id. “At the preliminary 
          injunction stage, the movant must clearly show only that each element of 
          standing is likely to obtain in the case at hand.” Speech First, Inc. v. Fenves, 
          979 F.3d 319, 330 (5th Cir. 2020) (citations omitted). The presence of any 
          one plaintiff with standing to pursue injunctive relief as to the Plaintiffs’ First-
          Amendment claim satisfies Article III’s case-or-controversy requirement. 
          Rumsfeld v. F. for Acad. & Institutional Rts., Inc., 547 U.S. 47, 52 n.2 (2006). 
                            A. 
              An injury-in-fact is “‘an invasion of a legally protected interest’ that 
          is ‘concrete and particularized’ and ‘actual or imminent, not conjectural or 
          hypothetical.’” Spokeo, Inc. v. Robins, 578 U.S. 330, 339 (2016) (quoting 
          Lujan, 504 U.S. at 560). “For a threatened future injury to satisfy the 
          imminence requirement, there must be at least a ‘substantial risk’ that the 
          injury will occur.” Crawford v. Hinds Cnty. Bd. of Supervisors, 1 F.4th 371, 375 
          (5th Cir. 2021) (quoting Stringer, 942 F.3d at 721). Past harm can constitute 
          an injury-in-fact for purposes of pursuing injunctive relief if it causes 
          “continuing, present adverse effects.” City of Los Angeles v. Lyons, 461 U.S. 
          95, 102 (1983) (quoting O’Shea v. Littleton, 414 U.S. 488, 495–96 (1974)). 
          Otherwise, “‘[p]ast wrongs are evidence’ of the likelihood of a future injury 
          but ‘do not in themselves amount to that real and immediate threat of injury 
          necessary to make out a case or controversy.’” Crawford, 1 F.4th at 375 
          (quoting Lyons, 461 U.S. at 102–03) (alteration adopted). 
              Each of the Individual Plaintiffs has shown past  injury-in-fact. 
          Bhattacharya’s and Kulldorff’s sworn declarations allege that their article,

        Case: 23-30445      Document: 00516889176     Page: 17     Date Filed: 09/08/2023
                          No. 23-30445 
          the Great Barrington Declaration, which was critical of the government’s 
          COVID-related policies such as lockdowns, was “deboosted” in Google 
          search results and removed from Facebook and Reddit, and that their 
          roundtable discussion with Florida Governor Ron DeSantis concerning mask 
          requirements in schools was removed from YouTube. Kulldorff also claimed 
          censorship of his personal Twitter and LinkedIn accounts due to his opinions 
          concerning vaccine and mask mandates; both accounts were suspended 
          (although ultimately restored). Kheriaty, in his sworn declaration, attested to 
          the fact that his Twitter following was “artificially suppressed” and his posts 
          “shadow bann[ed]” so that they did not appear in his followers’ feeds due to 
          his views on vaccine mandates and lockdowns, and that a video of one of his 
          interviews concerning vaccine mandates was removed from YouTube (but 
          ultimately re-posted). Hoft—founder, owner, and operator of news website 
          The Gateway Pundit—submitted a sworn declaration averring that The 
          Gateway Pundit’s Twitter account was suspended and then banned for its 
          tweets about vaccine mandates and election fraud, its Facebook posts 
          concerning COVID-19 and election security were either banned or flagged as 
          false or misinformation, and a YouTube video concerning voter fraud was 
          removed. Hoft’s declaration included photographic proof of the Twitter and 
          Facebook censorship he had suffered. And Hines’s declaration swears that 
          her personal Facebook account was suspended and the Facebook posts of her 
          organization, Health Freedom Louisiana, were censored and removed for 
          their views on vaccine and mask mandates. 
              The officials do not contest that these past injuries occurred. Instead, 
          they argue that the Individual Plaintiffs have failed to demonstrate that the 
          harm from these past injuries is ongoing or that similar injury is likely to 
          reoccur in the future, as required for standing to pursue injunctive relief. We 
          disagree with both assertions.  
                            17 
        Case: 23-30445      Document: 00516889176     Page: 18     Date Filed: 09/08/2023
                          No. 23-30445 
              All five Individual Plaintiffs have stated in sworn declarations that 
          their prior censorship has caused them to self-censor and carefully word 
          social-media posts moving forward in hopes of avoiding suspensions, bans, 
          and censorship in the future. Kulldorff, for example, explained that he now 
          “restrict[s] what [he] say[s] on social-media platforms to avoid suspension 
          and other penalties.” Kheriaty described how he now must be “extremely 
          careful when posting any information on Twitter related to the vaccines, to 
          avoid getting banned” and that he intentionally “limit[s] what [he] say[s] 
          publicly,” even “on topics where [he] ha[s] specific scientific and ethical 
          expertise and professional experience.” And Hoft notes that, “[t]o avoid 
          suspension and other forms of censorship, [his website] frequently avoid[s] 
          posting content that [it] would otherwise post on social-media platforms, and 
          [] frequently alter[s] content to make it less likely to trigger censorship 
          policies.” These lingering effects of past censorship must be factored into the 
          standing calculus. See Lyons, 461 U.S. at 102. 
              As the Supreme Court has recognized, this chilling of the Individual 
          Plaintiffs’ exercise of their First Amendment rights is, itself, a 
          constitutionally sufficient injury. See Laird v. Tatum, 408 U.S. 1, 11 (1972). 
          True, “to confer standing, allegations of chilled speech or self-censorship 
          must arise from a fear of [future harm] that is not imaginary or wholly 
          speculative.” Zimmerman v. City of Austin, Tex., 881 F.3d 378, 390 (5th Cir. 
          2018) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted); see also Clapper v. 
          Amnesty Int’l USA, 568 U.S. 398, 416 (2013) (Plaintiffs “cannot manufacture 
          standing merely by inflicting harm on themselves based on their fears of 
          hypothetical future harm”). But the fears motivating the Individual 
          Plaintiffs’ self-censorship, here, are far from hypothetical. Rather, they are 
          grounded in the very real censorship injuries they have previously suffered to 
          their speech on social media, which are “evidence of the likelihood of a future 
          injury.”  Crawford, 1 F.4th at 375 (internal quotation marks and citation 
                            18 
                Case: 23-30445      Document: 00516889176     Page: 19     Date Filed: 09/08/2023
                                                   No. 23-30445 
                    omitted). Supported by this evidence, the Individual Plaintiffs’ self-
                    censorship is a cognizable, ongoing harm resulting from their past censorship 
                    injuries, and therefore constitutes injury-in-fact upon which those Plaintiffs 
                    may pursue injunctive relief. Lyons, 461 U.S. at 102. 
                           Separate from their ongoing harms, the Individual Plaintiffs have 
                    shown a substantial risk that the injuries they suffered in the past will reoccur. 
                    The officials suggest that there is no threat of future injury because “Twitter 
                    has stopped enforcing its COVID-related misinformation policy.” But this 
                    does nothing to mitigate the risk of future harm to the Individual Plaintiffs. 
                    Twitter continues to enforce a robust general misinformation policy, and the 
                    Individual Plaintiffs seek to express views—and have been censored for their 
                    views—on topics well beyond COVID-19, including allegations of election 
                                                                 3
                    fraud and the Hunter Biden laptop story.  Plaintiffs use social-media 
                    platforms other than Twitter—such as Facebook and YouTube—which still 
                                                                                 4
                    enforce COVID- or health-specific misinformation policies.  And most 
                    fundamentally, the Individual Plaintiffs are not seeking to enjoin Twitter’s 
                    content moderation policies (or those of any other social-media platform, for 
                    that matter). Rather, as Plaintiffs’ counsel made clear at oral argument, what 
                    the Individual Plaintiffs are challenging is the government’s interference with

                             Notably, Twitter maintains a separate “crisis misinformation policy” which

                     those social-media companies’ independent application of their policies. And 
                     there is no evidence to suggest that the government’s meddling has ceased. 
                     To the contrary, the officials’ attorney conceded at oral argument that they 
                     continue to be in regular contact with social-media platforms concerning 
                     content-moderation issues today.  
                            The officials also contend that future harm is unlikely because “all 
                     three plaintiffs who suggested that their social-media accounts had been 
                     permanently suspended in the past now appear to have active accounts.” But 
                     as the Ninth Circuit recently recognized, this fact weighs in Plaintiffs’ favor. 
                                                                                               5
                     In O’Handley v. Weber, considering this issue in the context of redressability,  
                     the Ninth Circuit explained: 
                            Until recently, it was doubtful whether [injunctive] relief 
                            would remedy [the plaintiff]’s alleged injuries because Twitter 
                            had permanently suspended his account, and the requested 
                            injunction [against government-imposed social-media 
                            censorship] would not change that fact. Those doubts 
                            disappeared in December 2022 when Twitter restored his 
                            account. 
                     62 F.4th 1145, 1162 (9th Cir. 2023). The same logic applies here. If the 
                     Individual Plaintiffs did not currently have active social-media accounts, then 
                     there would be no risk of future government-coerced censorship of their 
                     speech on those accounts. But since the Individual Plaintiffs continue to be 
                     active speakers on social media, they continue to face the very real and 
                     imminent threat of government-coerced social-media censorship.

                             When plaintiffs seek injunctive relief, the injury-in-fact and redressability 
                     requirements intersect. Stringer, 942 F.3d at 720. So, it makes no difference that the Ninth 
                     Circuit addressed the issue of reinstated social-media accounts in its redressability analysis 
                     while we address it as part of injury-in-fact. The ultimate question is whether there was a 
                     sufficient threat of future injury to warrant injunctive relief.

                          No. 23-30445 
              Because the Individual Plaintiffs have demonstrated ongoing harm 
          from their past censorship as well as a substantial risk of future harm, they 
          have established an injury-in-fact sufficient to support their request for 
          injunctive relief.  
                            B. 
              Turning to the second element of Article III standing, the Individual 
          Plaintiffs were also required to show that their injuries were “fairly 
          traceable” to the challenged conduct of the officials. Stringer, 942 F.3d at 
          720. When, as is alleged here, the “causal relation between [the claimed] 
          injury and [the] challenged action depends upon the decision of an 
          independent third party . . . standing is not precluded, but it is ordinarily 
          substantially more difficult to establish.” California v. Texas, 141 S. Ct. 2104, 
          2117 (2021) (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). “To satisfy that 
          burden, the plaintiff[s] must show at the least ‘that third parties will likely 
          react in predictable ways.’” Id. (quoting Dep’t of Com. v. New York, 139 S. Ct. 
          2551, 2566 (2019)). 
              The officials contend that traceability is lacking because the Individual 
          Plaintiffs’ censorship was a result of “independent decisions of social-media 
          companies.” This conclusion, they say, is a matter of timing: social-media 
          platforms implemented content-moderation policies in early 2020 and 
          therefore the Biden Administration—which took office in January 2021—
          “could not be responsible for [any resulting] content moderation.” But as we 
          just explained, the Individual Plaintiffs do not challenge the social-media 
          platforms’ content-moderation policies. So, the fact that the Individual 
          Plaintiffs’ censorship can be traced back, at least in part, to third-party 
          policies that pre-date the current presidential administration is irrelevant. 
          The dispositive question is whether the Individual Plaintiffs’ censorship can 
                            21 
        Case: 23-30445      Document: 00516889176     Page: 22     Date Filed: 09/08/2023
                          No. 23-30445 
          also be traced to government-coerced enforcement of those policies. We agree 
          with the district court that it can be. 
              On this issue, Department of Commerce is instructive. There, a group 
          of plaintiffs brought a constitutional challenge against the federal 
          government’s decision to reinstate a citizenship question on the 2020 census. 
          139 S. Ct. at 2561. Their theory of harm was that, as a result of this added 
          question, noncitizen households would respond to the census at lower rates 
          than citizen households due to fear of immigration-related consequences, 
          which would, in turn, lead to undercounting of population in certain states 
          and a concomitant diminishment in political representation and loss of 
          federal funds. Id. at 2565–66. In response, the government presented many 
          of the same causation arguments raised here, contending that any harm to the 
          plaintiffs was “not fairly traceable to the [government]’s decision” but rather 
          “depend[ed] on the independent action of third parties” (there, noncitizens 
          refusing to respond to the census; here, social-media companies censoring 
          posts) which “would be motivated by unfounded fears that the Federal 
          Government will itself break the law” (there, “using noncitizens’ answers 
          against them for law enforcement purposes”; here, retaliatory enforcement 
          actions or regulatory reform). Id. But a unanimous Supreme Court disagreed. 
          As the Court explained, the plaintiffs had “met their burden of showing that 
          third parties will likely react in predictable ways to the citizenship question” 
          because evidence “established that noncitizen households have historically 
          responded to the census at lower rates than other groups” and the district 
          court had “not clearly err[ed] in crediting the . . . theory that the discrepancy 
          [was] likely attributable at least in part to noncitizens’ reluctance to answer a 
          citizenship question.” Id. at 2566. 
              That logic is directly applicable here. The Individual Plaintiffs 
          adduced extensive evidence that social-media platforms have engaged in 
          censorship of certain viewpoints on key issues and that the government has 
                            22 
        Case: 23-30445      Document: 00516889176     Page: 23     Date Filed: 09/08/2023
                          No. 23-30445 
          engaged in a years-long pressure campaign designed to ensure that the 
          censorship aligned with the government’s preferred viewpoints. The district 
          court did not clearly err in crediting the Individual Plaintiffs’ theory that the 
          social-media platforms’ censorship decisions were likely attributable at least 
          in part to the platforms’ reluctance to risk the adverse legal or regulatory 
          consequences that could result from a refusal to adhere to the government’s 
          directives. The Individual Plaintiffs therefore met their burden of showing 
          that the social-media platforms will likely react in a predictable way—i.e., 
          censoring speech—in response to the government’s actions. 
              To be sure, there were instances where the social-media platforms 
          declined to remove content that the officials had identified for censorship. But 
          predictability does not require certainty, only likelihood. See Dep’t of Com., 
          139 S. Ct. at 2566 (requiring that third parties “will likely react in predictable 
          ways”). Here, the Individual Plaintiffs presented extensive evidence of 
          escalating threats—both public and private—by government officials aimed 
          at social-media companies concerning their content-moderation decisions. 
          The district court thus had a sound basis upon which to find a likelihood that, 
          faced with unrelenting pressure from the most powerful office in the world, 
          social-media platforms did, and would continue to, bend to the government’s 
          will. This determination was not, as the officials contend, based on 
          “unadorned speculation.” Rather, it was a logical conclusion based directly 
          on the evidence adduced during preliminary discovery.      
                            C. 
              The final element of Article III standing—redressability—required 
          the Individual Plaintiffs to demonstrate that it was “likely, as opposed to 
          merely speculative, that the [alleged] injury will be redressed by a favorable 
          decision.” Lujan, 504 U.S. at 561 (internal quotation marks and citation 
          omitted). The redressability analysis focuses on “the relationship between 
                            23 
                 Case: 23-30445      Document: 00516889176     Page: 24     Date Filed: 09/08/2023
                                                     No. 23-30445 
                     the judicial relief requested and the injury” alleged. California, 141 S. Ct. at 
                     2115 (internal quotation marks and citation omitted). 
                            Beginning first with the injury alleged, we have noted multiple times 
                     now an important distinction between censorship as a result of social-media 
                     platforms’ independent application of their content-moderation policies, on 
                     the one hand, and censorship as a result of social-media platforms’ 
                     government-coerced application of those policies, on the other. As Plaintiffs’ 
                     counsel made clear at oral argument, the Individual Plaintiffs seek to redress 
                     the latter injury, not the former.  
                            The Individual Plaintiffs have not sought to invalidate social-media 
                     companies’ censorship policies. Rather, they asked the district court to 
                     restrain the officials from unlawfully interfering with the social-media 
                     companies’ independent application of their content-moderation policies. As 
                     the Ninth Circuit has also recognized, there is a direct relationship between 
                     this requested relief and the injury alleged such that redressability is satisfied. 
                     See O’Handley, 62 F.4th at 1162. 
                                                         D. 
                            We also conclude that the State Plaintiffs are likely to establish direct 
                              6
                     standing.  First, state officials have suffered, and will likely continue to suffer, 
                     direct censorship on social media. For example, the Louisiana Department of 
                     Justice posted a video showing Louisiana citizens testifying at the State 
                     Capitol and questioning the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines and mask 
                     mandates. But one platform removed the video for spreading alleged 
                     “medical misinformation” and warned that any subsequent violations would 
                            _____________________ 
                            6 The State Plaintiffs also contend that they have parens patriae standing. We do 
                     not consider this alternative argument. 
                                                         24 
                 Case: 23-30445      Document: 00516889176     Page: 25     Date Filed: 09/08/2023
                                                     No. 23-30445 
                     result in suspension of the state’s account. The state thereafter modified its 
                     practices for posting on social media for fear of future censorship injury. 
                            Similarly, another platform took down a Louisiana state legislator’s 
                     post discussing COVID vaccines. And several videos posted by St. Louis 
                     County showing residents discussing COVID policies were removed, too. 
                     Acts of this nature continue to this day. In fact, at oral argument, counsel for 
                     the State of Louisiana explained that YouTube recently removed a video of 
                     counsel, speaking in his official capacity, criticizing the federal government’s 
                                                                    7
                     alleged unconstitutional censorship in this case.  
                            These acts of censorship confer standing for substantially the same 
                     reasons as those discussed for the Individual Plaintiffs. That is, they 
                     constitute an ongoing injury, and demonstrate a likelihood of future injury, 
                     traceable to the conduct of the federal officials and redressable by an 
                     injunction against them.  
                            The federal officials admit that these instances of censorship occurred 
                     but deny that the State Plaintiffs have standing based on the assertion that 
                     “the First Amendment does not confer rights on States.” But the Supreme 
                     Court has made clear that the government (state and otherwise) has a 
                     “right” to speak on its own behalf. Bd. of Regents of Univ. of Wis. Sys. v. 
                     Southworth, 529 U.S. 217, 229 (2000); see also Walker v. Tex. Div., Sons of 
                     Confederate Veterans, Inc., 576 U.S. 200, 207–08 (2015). Perhaps that right 
                     derives from a state’s sovereign nature, rather than from the First 
                     Amendment itself. But regardless of the source of the right, the State 
                            _____________________ 
                            7 These actions are not limited to the State Plaintiffs.  On the contrary, other states’ 
                     officials have offered evidence of numerous other instances where their posts were 
                     removed, restricted, or otherwise censored.

          Plaintiffs sustain a direct injury when the social-media accounts of state 
          officials are censored due to federal coercion. 
              Federally coerced censorship harms the State Plaintiffs’ ability to 
          listen to their citizens as well. This right to listen is “reciprocal” to the State 
          Plaintiffs’ right to speak and constitutes an independent basis for the State 
          Plaintiffs’ standing here. Va. State Bd. of Pharm. v. Va. Citizens Consumer 
          Council, 425 U.S. 748, 757 (1976). 
              Officials from the States of Missouri and Louisiana testified that they 
          regularly use social media to monitor their citizens’ concerns. As explained 
          by one Louisiana official: 
              [M]ask and vaccine mandates for students have been a very 
              important source of concern and public discussion by 
              Louisiana citizens over the last year. It is very important for me 
              to have access to free public discourse on social media on these 
              issues so I can understand what our constituents are actually 
              thinking, feeling, and expressing about such issues, and so I can 
              communicate properly with them.  
          And a Missouri official testified to several examples of critical speech on an 
          important topic that he was not able to review because it was censored: 
              [O]ne parent who posted on nextdoor.com (a neighborhood 
              networking site operated by Facebook) an online petition to 
              encourage his school to remain mask-optional found that his 
              posts were quietly removed without notifying him, and his 
              online friends never saw them.  Another parent in the same 
              school district who objected to mask mandates for 
              schoolchildren responded to Dr. Fauci on Twitter, and 
              promptly received a warning from Twitter that his account 
              would be banned if he did not delete the tweets criticizing Dr. 
              Fauci’s approach to mask mandates.  These examples are just 
              the sort of online speech by Missourians that it is important for 
              me and the Missouri Attorney General’s Office to be aware of.

                                                    No. 23-30445 
                            The Government does not dispute that the State Plaintiffs have a 
                     crucial interest in listening to their citizens. Indeed, the CDC’s own witness 
                     explained that if content were censored and removed from social-media 
                     platforms, government communicators would not “have the full picture” of 
                     what their citizens’ true concerns are. So, when the federal government 
                     coerces or substantially encourages third parties to censor certain viewpoints, 
                     it hampers the states’ right to hear their constituents and, in turn, reduces 
                     their ability to respond to the concerns of their constituents. This injury, too, 
                     means the states likely have standing. See Va. State Bd. of Pharm., 425 U.S. at 
                     757. 
                                                       *   *   * 
                            The Plaintiffs have standing because they have demonstrated ongoing 
                     harm from past social-media censorship and a likelihood of future censorship, 
                     both of which are injuries traceable to government-coerced enforcement of 
                     social-media platforms’ content-moderation policies and redressable by an 
                     injunction against the government officials. We therefore proceed to the 
                                                                  8

                            A party seeking a preliminary injunction must establish that (1) they 
                     are likely to succeed on the merits, (2) there is a “substantial threat” they 
                     will suffer an “irreparable injury” otherwise, (3) the potential injury 
                     “outweighs any harm that will result” to the other side, and (4) an injunction 
                     will not “disserve the public interest.” Atchafalaya Basinkeeper v. U.S. Army

                            8 The Individual Plaintiffs’ standing and the State Plaintiffs’ standing provide 
                     independent bases upon which the Plaintiffs’ injunctive-relief claim may proceed since 
                     there need be only one plaintiff with standing to satisfy the requirements of Article III.

                                                     No. 23-30445 
                     Corps of Eng’rs, 894 F.3d 692, 696 (5th Cir. 2018) (citing La Union Del Pueblo 
                     Entero v. FEMA, 608 F.3d 217, 219 (5th Cir. 2010)). Of course, a 
                     “preliminary injunction is an extraordinary remedy,” meaning it should not 
                     be entered lightly. Id.  
                            We start with likelihood of success. The Plaintiffs allege that federal 
                     officials ran afoul of the First Amendment by coercing and significantly 
                     encouraging “social-media platforms to censor disfavored [speech],” 
                     including by “threats of adverse government action” like antitrust 
                     enforcement and legal reforms. We agree. 
                                                         A. 
                            The government cannot abridge free speech. U.S. Const. 
                     amend. I. A private party, on the other hand, bears no such burden—it is 
                     “not ordinarily constrained by the First Amendment.” Manhattan Cmty. 
                     Access Corp. v. Halleck, 139 S. Ct. 1921, 1930 (2019). That changes, though, 
                     when a private party is coerced or significantly encouraged by the 
                     government to such a degree that its “choice”—which if made by the 
                     government would be unconstitutional, Norwood v. Harrison, 413 U.S. 455, 
                     465 (1973)—“must in law be deemed to be that of the State.” Blum v. 
                     Yaretsky, 457 U.S. 991, 1004 (1982); Barnes v. Lehman, 861 F.2d 1383, 1385–
                                       9                                     10
                     36 (5th Cir. 1988).  This is known as the close nexus test.  
                            _____________________ 
                            9 That makes sense: First Amendment rights “are protected not only against 
                     heavy-handed frontal attack, but also from being stifled by more subtle governmental 
                     interference.” Bates v. City of Little Rock, 361 U.S. 516, 523 (1960). 
                            10
                              Note that, at times, we have called this test by a few other names. See, e.g., Frazier 
                     v. Bd. of Trustees of Nw. Miss. Reg’l Med. Ctr., 765 F.2d 1278, 1284 (5th Cir. 1985) (“the fair 
                     attribution test”); Bass v. Parkwood Hosp., 180 F.3d 234, 242 (5th Cir. 1999) (“The state 
                     compulsion (or coercion) test”). We settle that dispute now—it is the close nexus test. Am. 
                     Mfrs., 526 U.S. at 52 (a “close nexus” is required). In addition, some of our past decisions 
                                                         28

                          No. 23-30445 
              Under that test, we “begin[] by identifying ‘the specific conduct of 
          which the plaintiff complains.’” Am. Mfrs. Mut. Ins. Co. v. Sullivan, 526 U.S. 
          40, 51 (1999) (quoting Blum, 457 U.S. at 1004 (“Faithful adherence to the 
          ‘state action’ requirement . . . requires careful attention to the gravamen of 
          the plaintiff’s complaint.”)). Then, we ask whether the government 
          sufficiently induced that act. Not just any coaxing will do, though. After all, 
          “the government can speak for itself,” which includes the right to “advocate 
          and defend its own policies.” Southworth, 529 U.S. at 229; see also Walker, 
          576 U.S. at 207. But, on one hand there is persuasion, and on the other there 
          is coercion and significant encouragement—two distinct means of satisfying 
          the close nexus test. See Louisiana Div. Sons of Confederate Veterans v. City of 
          Natchitoches, 821 F. App’x 317, 320 (5th Cir. 2020) (per curiam) 
          (“Responding agreeably to a request and being all but forced by the coercive 
          power of a governmental official are different categories of responses . . .”). 
          Where we draw that line, though, is the question before us today. 
                            1. 
              We start with encouragement. To constitute “significant 
          encouragement,” there must be such a “close nexus” between the parties 
          that the government is practically “responsible” for the challenged decision. 
          Blum, 457 U.S. at 1004 (emphasis in original). What, then, is a close nexus? 
          We know that “the mere fact that a business is subject to state regulation” is 
          not sufficient. Id. (alteration adopted) (citation omitted); Halleck, 139 S. Ct. 
          at 1932 (“Put simply, being regulated by the State does not make one a state 
          actor.”). And, it is well established that the government’s “[m]ere approval 
          of or acquiescence in” a private party’s actions is not enough either. Blum, 
              _____________________ 
          have confused this test with the joint action test, see Bass, 180 F.3d at 242, but the two are 
          separate tests with separate considerations.

          457 U.S. at 1004–05. Instead, for encouragement, we find that the 
          government must exercise some active, meaningful control over the private 
          party’s decision. 
              Take Blum v. Yaretsky. There, the Supreme Court found there was no 
          state action because a decision to discharge a patient—even if it followed 
          from the “requir[ed] completion of a form” under New York law—was made 
          by private physicians, not the government. Id. at 1006–08. The plaintiff 
          argued that, by regulating and overseeing the facility, the government had 
          “affirmatively command[ed]” the decision. Id. at 1005. The Court was not 
          convinced—it emphasized that “physicians, [] not the forms, make the 
          decision” and they do so under “professional standards that are not 
          established by the State.” Id. Similarly, in Rendell-Baker v. Kohn the Court 
          found that a private school—which the government funded and placed 
          students at—was not engaged in state action because the conduct at issue, 
          namely the decision to fire someone, “[was] not . . . influenced by any state 
          regulation.” 457 U.S. 830, 841 (1982). 
              Compare that, though, to Roberts v. Louisiana Downs, Inc., 742 F.2d 
          221 (5th Cir. 1984). There, we held that a horseracing club’s action was 
          attributable to the state because the Louisiana government—through legal 
          and informal supervision—was overly involved in the decision to deny a racer 
          a stall. Id. at 224. “Something more [was] present [] than simply extensive 
          regulation of an industry, or passive approval by a state regulatory entity of a 
          decision by a regulated business.” Id. at 228. Instead, the stalling decision 
          was made partly by the “racing secretary,” a legislatively created position 
          accompanied by expansive supervision from on-site state officials who had 
          the “power to override decisions” made by the club’s management. Id. So, 
          even though the secretary was plainly a “private employee” paid by the club, 
          the state’s extensive oversight—coupled with some level of authority on the 
          part of the state—meant that the club’s choice was not fully independent or 
                            30 
                 Case: 23-30445      Document: 00516889176     Page: 31     Date Filed: 09/08/2023
                                                     No. 23-30445 
                     made wholly subject to its own policies. Id. at 227–28. So, this case is on the 
                     opposite end of the state-involvement spectrum to Blum.  
                            Per  Blum  and  Roberts, then, significant encouragement requires 
                     “[s]omething more” than uninvolved oversight from the government. Id. at 
                     228. After all, there must be a “close nexus” that renders the government 
                     practically “responsible” for the decision. Blum, 457 U.S. at 1004. Taking that 
                     in context, we find that the clear throughline for encouragement in our 
                     caselaw is that there must be some exercise of active (not passive), meaningful 
                     (impactful enough to render them responsible) control on the part of the 
                     government over the private party’s challenged decision. Whether that is (1) 
                     entanglement in a party’s independent decision-making or (2) direct 
                     involvement in carrying out the decision itself, the government must 
                     encourage the decision to such a degree that we can fairly say it was the 
                     state’s choice, not the private actor’s. See id.; Roberts, 742 F.2d at 224; 
                     Rendell-Baker, 457 U.S. at 841 (close nexus test is met if action is “compelled 
                     or [] influenced” by the state (emphasis added)); Frazier, 765 F.2d at 1286 
                     (significant encouragement is met when “the state has had some affirmative 
                                                                                             11
                     role, albeit one of encouragement short of compulsion,” in the decision).

                            11 This differs from the “joint action” test that we have considered in other cases. 
                     Under that doctrine, a private party may be considered a state actor when it “operates as a 
                     ‘willful participant in joint activity with the State or its agents.’” Brentwood Acad. v. Tenn. 
                     Secondary Sch. Athletic Ass’n, 531 U.S. 288, 296 (2001) (quoting Lugar v. Edmonson Oil Co., 
                     457 U.S. 922, 941 (1982)). The difference between the two lies primarily in the degree of 
                     the state’s involvement.  
                            Under the joint action test, the level of integration is very high—there must be 
                     “pervasive entwinement” between the parties. Id. at 298. That is integration to such a 
                     degree that “will support a conclusion that an ostensibly private organization ought to be 
                     charged with a public character.” Id. at 302 (emphasis added) (finding state action by athletic 
                     association when public officials served on the association’s board, public institutions 
                     provided most of the association’s funding, and the association’s employees received 
                     public benefits); see also Rendell-Baker, 457 U.S. at 842 (requiring a “symbiotic

              Take Howard Gault Co. v. Texas Rural Legal Aid, Inc., 848 F.2d 544 
          (5th Cir. 1988). There, a group of onion growers—by way of state picketing 
          laws and local officials—shut down a workers’ strike. Id. at 548–49. We 
          concluded that the growers’ “activity”—axing the strike—“while not 
          compelled by the state, was so significantly encouraged, both overtly and 
          covertly, that the choice must in law be deemed to be that of the state.” Id. 
          at 555 (alterations adopted) (citation and quotation marks omitted)

          relationship”); Frazier, 765 F.2d at 1288 & n.22 (explaining that although the joint action 
          test involves the government playing a “meaningful role” in the private actor’s decision, 
          that role must be part of a “functionally symbiotic” relationship that is so extensive that 
          “any act of the private entity will be fairly attributable to the state even if it cannot be shown 
          that the government played a direct role in the particular action challenged.” (emphases 
          added)).  
              Under the close nexus test, however, the government is not deeply intertwined 
          with the private actor as a whole. Instead, the state is involved in only one facet of the 
          private actor’s operations—its decision-making process regarding the challenged conduct. 
          Roberts, 742 F.2d at 224; Howard Gault, 848 F.2d at 555. That is a much narrower level of 
          integration.  See Roberts, 742 F.2d at 228 (“We do not today hold that the state and 
          Louisiana Downs are in such a relationship that all acts of the track constitute state action, 
          nor that all acts of the racing secretary constitute state action,” but instead that “[i]n the 
          area of stalling, . . . state regulation and involvement is so specific and so pervasive that 
          [such] decisions may be considered to bear the imprimatur of the state.”). Consequently, 
          the showings required by a plaintiff differ. Under the joint action test, the plaintiff must 
          prove substantial integration between the two entities in toto. For the close nexus test, the 
          plaintiff instead must only show significant involvement from the state in the particular 
          challenged action. 
              Still, there is admittedly some overlap between the tests. See Brentwood, 531 U.S. at 
          303 (“‘Coercion’ and ‘encouragement’ are like ‘entwinement’ in referring to kinds of facts 
          that can justify characterizing an ostensibly private action as public instead. Facts that 
          address any of these criteria are significant, but no one criterion must necessarily be 
          applied. When, therefore, the relevant facts show pervasive entwinement to the point of 
          largely overlapping identity, the implication of state action is not affected by pointing out 
          that the facts might not loom large under a different test.”). But, that is to be expected—
          these tests are not “mechanical[ly]” applied. Roberts, 742 F.2d at 224.  
                            32 
                 Case: 23-30445      Document: 00516889176     Page: 33     Date Filed: 09/08/2023

                     (emphasis added).  Specifically, “[i]t was the heavy participation of state 
                     and state officials,” including local prosecutors and police officers, “that 
                     [brought] [the conduct] under color of state law.” Id. In other words, the 
                     officials were directly involved in carrying out the challenged decision. That 
                     satisfied the requirement that, to encourage a decision, the government must 
                     exert some meaningful, active control over the private party’s decision. 
                            Our reading of what encouragement means under the close nexus test 
                     tracks with other federal courts, too. For example, the Ninth Circuit reads 
                     the close nexus test to be satisfied when, through encouragement, the 
                     government “overwhelm[s] the private party[’s]” choice in the matter, 
                     forcing it to “act in a certain way.” O’Handley, 62 F.4th at 1158; Rawson v. 
                     Recovery Innovations, Inc., 975 F.3d 742, 751 (9th Cir. 2020) (“A finding that 
                     individual state actors or other state requirements literally ‘overrode’ a 
                     nominally private defendant’s independent judgment might very well 
                     provide relevant information.”). That analysis, much like meaningful 
                     control, asks whether a decision “was the result of [a party’s] own 
                     independent judgment.” O’Handley, 62 F.4th at 1159.  
                                                          2. 
                            Next, we take coercion—a separate and distinct means of satisfying 
                     the close nexus test. Generally speaking, if the government compels the

                              We note that although state-action caselaw seems to deal most often with § 1983 
                     (i.e., the under-color-of-law prong) and the Fourteenth Amendment, there is no clear 
                     directive from the Supreme Court that any variation in the law or government at issue 
                     changes the state-action analysis. See Blum, 457 U.S. at 1004. In fact, we have expressly 
                     rejected such ideas. See Miller v. Hartwood Apartments, Ltd., 689 F.2d 1239, 1243 (5th Cir. 
                     1982) (“Although the Blum decision turned on § 1983, we find the determination of federal 
                     action to rest on the same general principles as determinations of state action.”); Barnes, 
                     861 F.2d at 1385 (“The analysis of state action under the Fourteenth Amendment and the 
                     analysis of action under color of state law may coincide for purposes of § 1983.”).

          private party’s decision, the result will be considered a state action. Blum, 
          457 U.S. at 1004. So, what is coercion? We know that simply “being 
          regulated by the State does not make one a state actor.” Halleck, 139 S. Ct. at 
          1932. Coercion, too, must be something more. But, distinguishing coercion 
          from persuasion is a more nuanced task than doing the same for 
          encouragement. Encouragement is evidenced by an exercise of active, 
          meaningful control, whether by entanglement in the party’s decision-making 
          process or direct involvement in carrying out the decision itself. Therefore, 
          it may be more noticeable and, consequently, more distinguishable from 
          persuasion. Coercion, on the other hand, may be more subtle. After all, the 
          state may advocate—even forcefully—on behalf of its positions. Southworth, 
          529 U.S. at 229.  
              Consider a Second Circuit case, National Rifle Ass’n v. Vullo, 49 F.4th 
          700 (2d Cir. 2022). There, a New York state official “urged” insurers and 
          banks via strongly worded letters to drop the NRA as a client. Id. at 706. In 
          those letters, the official alluded to reputational harms that the companies 
          would suffer if they continued to support a group that has allegedly caused or 
          encouraged “devastation” and “tragedies” across the country. Id. at 709. 
          Also, the official personally told a few of the companies in a closed-door 
          meeting that she “was less interested in pursuing the [insurers’ regulatory] 
          infractions . . . so long as [they] ceased” working with the NRA. Id. at 718. 
          Ultimately, the Second Circuit found that both the letters and the statement 
          did not amount to coercion, but instead “permissible government speech.” 
          Id. at 717, 719. In reaching that decision, the court emphasized that 
          “[a]lthough she did have regulatory authority over the target audience,” the 
          official’s letters were written in a “nonthreatening tone” and used 
          persuasive, non-intimidating language. Id. at 717. Relatedly, while she 
          referenced “adverse consequences” if the companies did not comply, they 
          were only “reputational risks”—there was no intimation that “punishment 
                            34 
                 Case: 23-30445      Document: 00516889176     Page: 35     Date Filed: 09/08/2023

                     or adverse regulatory action would follow the failure to accede to the 
                     request.” Id. (alterations adopted). As for the “so long as” statement, the 
                     Second Circuit found that—when viewed in “context”—the official was 
                     merely “negotiating[] and resolving [legal] violations,” a legitimate power of 
                               13
                     her office.  Id. at 718–19. Because she was only “carrying out her regulatory 
                     responsibilities” and “engaging in legitimate enforcement action,” the 
                     official’s references to infractions were not coercive. Id. Thus, the Second 
                     Circuit found that seemingly threatening language was actually permissible 
                     government advocacy. 
                            That is not to say that coercion is always  difficult to identify. 
                     Sometimes, coercion is obvious. Take Bantam Books, Inc. v. Sullivan, 372 
                     U.S. 58 (1963). There, the Rhode Island Commission to Encourage 
                     Morality—a state-created entity—sought to stop the distribution of obscene 
                     books to kids. Id. at 59. So, it sent a letter to a book distributor with a list of 
                     verboten books and requested that they be taken off the shelves. Id. at 61–64. 
                     That request conveniently noted that compliance would “eliminate the 
                     necessity of our recommending prosecution to the Attorney General’s 
                     department.” Id. at 62 n.5. Per the Commission’s request, police officers 
                     followed up to make sure the books were removed. Id. at 68. The Court 
                     concluded that this “system of informal censorship,” which was “clearly 
                     [meant] to intimidate” the recipients through “threat of [] legal sanctions 
                     and other means of coercion” rendered the distributors’ decision to remove 
                     the books a state action. Id. at 64, 67, 71–72. Given Bantam Books, not-so

                              Apparently, the companies had previously issued “illegal insurance policies—
                     programs created and endorsed by the NRA”—that covered litigation defense costs 
                     resulting from any firearm-related injury or death, in violation of New York law. Vullo, 49 
                     F.4th at 718. The court reasoned that the official had the power to bring those issues to a 
                     close.  
                                                          35

                          No. 23-30445 
          subtle asks accompanied by a “system” of pressure (e.g., threats and follow-
          ups) are clearly coercive. 
              Still, it is rare that coercion is so black and white. More often, the facts 
          are complex and sprawling as was the case in Vullo. That means it can be quite 
          difficult to parse out coercion from persuasion. We, of course, are not the 
          first to recognize this. In that vein, the Second Circuit has crafted a four-
          factor test that distills the considerations of Bantam Books into a workable 
          standard. We, lacking such a device, adopt the Second Circuit’s approach as 
          a helpful, non-exclusive tool for completing the task before us, namely 
          identifying when the state’s messages cross into impermissible coercion. 
              The Second Circuit starts with the premise that a government 
          message is coercive—as opposed to persuasive—if it “can reasonably be 
          interpreted as intimating that some form of punishment or adverse regulatory 
          action will follow the failure to accede to the official’s request.” Vullo, 49 
          F.4th at 715 (quotation marks and citation omitted). To distinguish such 
          “attempts to coerce” from “attempts to convince,” courts look to four 
          factors, namely (1) the speaker’s “word choice and tone”; (2) “whether the 
          speech was perceived as a threat”; (3) “the existence of regulatory 
          authority”; and, “perhaps most importantly, (4) whether the speech refers 
          to adverse consequences.” Id. (citations omitted). Still, “[n]o one factor is 
          dispositive.” Id. (citing Bantam Books, 372 U.S. at 67). For example, the 
          Second Circuit found in Vullo that the state officials’ communications were 
          not coercive because, in part, they were not phrased in an intimidating 
          manner and only referenced reputational harms—an otherwise acceptable 
          consequence for a governmental actor to threaten. Id. at 717, 719.  
              The Ninth Circuit has also adopted the four-factor approach and, in 
          doing so, has cogently spelled out the nuances of each factor. Consider 
          Kennedy v. Warren, 66 F.4th 1199 (9th Cir. 2023). There, Senator Elizabeth 
                            36 
        Case: 23-30445      Document: 00516889176     Page: 37     Date Filed: 09/08/2023
                          No. 23-30445 
          Warren penned a letter to Amazon asking it to stop selling a “false or 
          misleading” book on COVID. Id. at 1204. The senator stressed that, by 
          selling the book, Amazon was “providing consumers with false and 
          misleading information” and, in doing so, was pursuing what she described 
          as “an unethical, unacceptable, and potentially unlawful course of action.” 
          Id. So, she asked it to do better, including by providing a “public report” on 
          the effects of its related sales algorithms and a “plan to modify these 
          algorithms so that they no longer” push products peddling “COVID-19 
          misinformation.” Id. at 1205. The authors sued, but the Ninth Circuit found 
          no state action.  
              The court, lamenting that it can “be difficult to distinguish” between 
          persuasion and coercion, turned to the Second Circuit’s “useful non-
          exclusive” four-factor test. Id. at 1207. First, the court reasoned that the 
          senator’s letter, although made up of “strong rhetoric,” was framed merely 
          as a “request rather than a command.” Id. at 1208. Considering both the text 
          and the “tenor” of the parties’ relationship, the court concluded that the 
          letter was not unrelenting, nor did it “suggest[] that compliance was the only 
          realistic option.” Id. at 1208–09.  
              Second, and relatedly, even if she had said as much, the senator lacked 
          regulatory authority—she “ha[d] no unilateral power to penalize Amazon.” 
          Id. at 1210. Still, the sum of the second prong is more than just power. Given 
          that the overarching purpose of the four-factor test is to ask if the speaker’s 
          message can “reasonably be construed” as a “threat of adverse 
          consequences,” the lack of power is “certainly relevant.” Id. at 1209–10. 
          After all, the “absence of authority influences how a reasonable person would 
          read” an official’s message. Id. at 1210; see also Hammerhead Enters., Inc. v. 
          Brezenoff, 707 F.2d 33, 39 (2d Cir. 1983) (finding no government coercion 
          where city official lacked “the power to impose sanctions on merchants who 
          did not respond to [his] requests”) (citing Bantam Books, 372 U.S. at 71). For 
                            37 
                Case: 23-30445      Document: 00516889176     Page: 38     Date Filed: 09/08/2023
                                                    No. 23-30445 
                     example, in Warren, it would have been “unreasonable” to believe, given 
                     Senator Warren’s position “as a single Senator” who was “removed from 
                     the relevant levers of power,” that she could exercise any authority over 
                     Amazon. 66 F.4th at 1210. 
                           Still, the “lack of direct authority” is not entirely dispositive. Id. 
                     Because—per the Second and Ninth Circuits—the key question is whether 
                     a message can “reasonably be construed as coercive,” id. at 1209,14 a 
                     speaker’s power over the recipient need not be clearly defined or readily 
                     apparent, so long as it can be reasonably said that there is some tangible power 
                     lurking in the background. See Okwedy v. Molinari, 333 F.3d 339, 344 (2d Cir. 
                     2003) (finding a private party “could reasonably have believed” it would face 
                     retaliation if it ignored a borough president’s request because “[e]ven though 
                     [he] lacked direct regulatory control,” there was an “implicit threat” that he 
                     would “use whatever authority he does  have . . . to  interfere”  with  the 
                     party’s cashflow). That, of course, was not present in Warren. So, the second 
                     prong was easily resolved against state action.   
                           Third, the senator’s letter “contain[ed] no explicit reference” to 
                                              15
                     “adverse consequences.”  66 F.4th at 1211. And, beyond that, no “threat 
                           _____________________ 
                           14
                              According to the Ninth Circuit, that tracks with its precedent. “[I]n Carlin 
                     Communications, Inc. v. Mountain States Telephone & Telegraph Co., 827 F.2d 1291 (9th Cir. 
                     1987), [they] held that a deputy county attorney violated the First Amendment by 
                     threatening to prosecute a telephone company if it continued to carry a salacious dial-a-
                     message service.” Warren, 66 F.4th at 1207. But, “in American Family Association, Inc. v. 
                     City & County of San Francisco, 277 F.3d 1114 (9th Cir. 2002), [they] held that San Francisco 
                     officials did not violate the First Amendment when they criticized religious groups’ anti-
                     gay advertisements and urged television stations not to broadcast the ads.” Id. The rub, per 
                     the court, was that “public officials may criticize practices that they would have no 
                     constitutional ability to regulate, so long as there is no actual or threatened imposition of 
                     government power or sanction.” Id. 
                           15
                             The Ninth Circuit emphasized that officials may advocate for positions, 
                     including by “[g]enerating public pressure to motivate others to change their behavior.” 
                                                         38 
        Case: 23-30445      Document: 00516889176     Page: 39     Date Filed: 09/08/2023
                          No. 23-30445 
          [was] clear from the context.” Id. To be sure, an “official does not need to 
          say ‘or else,’” but there must be some message—even if “unspoken”—that 
          can be reasonably construed as intimating a threat. Id. at 1211–12. There, 
          when read “holistically,” the senator only implied that Amazon was 
          “morally complicit” in bad behavior, nothing more. Id. at 1212. 
              Fourth, there was no indication that Amazon perceived the message 
          as a threat. There was “no evidence” it “changed its algorithms”—“let 
          alone that it felt compelled to do so”—as a result of the senator’s urgings. Id. 
          at 1211. Admittedly, it is not required that the recipient “bow[] to 
          government pressure,” but courts are more likely to find coercion if there is 
          “some indication” that the message was “understood” as a threat, such as 
          evidence of actual change. Id. at 1210–11. In Warren, it was apparent (and 
          there was no sense to the contrary) that the minor policy change the company 
          did make stemmed from reputational concerns, not “fears of liability in a 
          court of law.” Id. at 1211. Considering the above, the court found that the 
          senator’s message amounted to an attempt at persuasion, not coercion. 
                            3. 
              To sum up, under the close nexus test, a private party’s conduct may 
          be state action if the government coerced or significantly encouraged it. Blum, 
          457 U.S. at 1004. Although this test is not mechanical, see Roberts, 742 F.2d 
          at 224 (noting that state action is “essentially [a] factual determination” 
          made by “sifting facts and weighing circumstances case by case to determine 
          if there is a sufficient nexus between the state and the particular aspect of the 
              _____________________ 
          Warren, 66 F.4th at 1208. In that vein, it dismissed any references to “potential legal 
          liability” because those statements do not necessarily “morph an effort to persuade into an 
          attempt to coerce.” Id. at 1209 (citing VDARE Found. v. City of Colo. Springs, 11 F.4th 1151, 
          1165 (10th Cir. 2021)). Instead, there must be “clear allegation[s] of legal violations or 
          threat[s] of specific enforcement actions.” Id. 
                            39 
        Case: 23-30445      Document: 00516889176     Page: 40     Date Filed: 09/08/2023
                          No. 23-30445 
          private individual’s conduct which is complained of” (citation and quotation 
          marks omitted)), there are clear, although not exclusive, ways to satisfy either 
          prong.  
              For encouragement, we read the law to require that a governmental 
          actor exercise active, meaningful control over the private party’s decision in 
          order to constitute a state action. That reveals itself in (1) entanglement in a 
          party’s independent decision-making or (2) direct involvement in carrying 
          out the decision itself. Compare Roberts, 742 F.2d at 224 (state had such 
          “continuous and intimate involvement” and supervision over horseracing 
          decision that, when coupled with its authority over the actor, it was 
          considered a state action) and Howard Gault, 848 F.2d at 555 (state eagerly, 
          and effectively, assisted a private party in shutting down a protest), with 
          Blum, 457 U.S. at 1008 (state did not sufficiently influence the decision as it 
          was made subject to independent standards). In any of those scenarios, the 
          state has such a “close nexus” with the private party that the government 
          actor is practically “responsible” for the decision, Blum, 457 U.S. at 1004, 
          because it has necessarily encouraged the private party to act and, in turn, 
          commandeered its independent judgment, O’Handley, 62 F.4th at 1158–59. 
              For coercion, we ask if the government compelled the decision by, 
          through threats or otherwise, intimating that some form of punishment will 
          follow a failure to comply. Vullo, 49 F.4th at 715. Sometimes, that is obvious 
          from the facts. See, e.g., Bantam Books, 372 U.S. at 62–63 (a mafiosi-style 
          threat of referral to the Attorney General accompanied with persistent 
          pressure and follow-ups). But, more often, it is not. So, to help distinguish 
          permissible persuasion from impermissible coercion, we turn to the Second 
          (and Ninth) Circuit’s four-factor test. Again, honing in on whether the 
          government “intimat[ed] that some form of punishment” will follow a 
          “failure to accede,” we parse the speaker’s messages to assess the (1) word 
          choice and tone, including the overall “tenor” of the parties’ relationship; 
                            40 
        Case: 23-30445      Document: 00516889176     Page: 41     Date Filed: 09/08/2023
                          No. 23-30445 
          (2) the recipient’s perception; (3) the presence of authority, which includes 
          whether it is reasonable to fear retaliation; and (4) whether the speaker refers 
          to adverse consequences. Vullo, 49 F.4th at 715; see also Warren, 66 F.4th at 
          1207. 
              Each factor, though, has important considerations to keep in mind. 
          For word choice and tone, “[a]n interaction will tend to be more threatening 
          if the official refuses to take ‘no’ for an answer and pesters the recipient until 
          it succumbs.” Warren, 66 F.4th at 1209 (citing Bantam Books, 372 U.S. at 62–
          63). That is so because we consider the overall “tenor” of the parties’ 
          relationship. Id. For authority, there is coercion even if the speaker lacks 
          present ability to act so long as it can “reasonably be construed” as a threat 
          worth heeding. Compare id. at 1210 (single senator had no worthwhile power 
          over recipient, practical or otherwise), with Okwedy, 333 F.3d at 344 
          (although local official lacked direct power over the recipient, company 
          “could reasonably have believed” from the letter that there was “an implicit 
          threat” and that he “would use whatever authority he does have” against it).  
              As for perception, it is not necessary that the recipient “admit that it 
          bowed to government pressure,” nor is it even “necessary for the recipient 
          to have complied with the official’s request”—“a credible threat may violate 
          the First Amendment even if ‘the victim ignores it, and the threatener folds 
          his tent.’” Warren, 66 F.4th at 1210 (quoting Backpage.com, LLC v. Dart, 807 
          F.3d 229, 231 (7th Cir. 2015)). Still, a message is more likely to be coercive if 
          there is some indication that the party’s decision resulted from the threat. Id. 
          at 1210–11. Finally, as for adverse consequences, the government need not 
          speak its threat aloud if, given the circumstances, it is fair to say that the 
          message intimates some form of punishment. Id. at 1209. If these factors 
          weigh in favor of finding the government’s message coercive, the coercion 
          test is met, and the private party’s resulting decision is a state action. 
                            41 
        Case: 23-30445      Document: 00516889176     Page: 42     Date Filed: 09/08/2023
                          No. 23-30445 
                            B. 
              With that in mind, we turn to the case at hand. We start with “the 
          specific conduct of which the plaintiff complains.” Am. Mfrs., 526 U.S. at 51. 
          Here, that is “censor[ing] disfavored speakers and viewpoints” on social 
          media. The Plaintiffs allege that the “Defendants [] coerced, threatened, and 
          pressured social-media platforms”—via “threats of adverse government 
          action” like increased regulation, antitrust enforcement, and changes to 
          Section 230—to make those censorship decisions. That campaign, per the 
          Plaintiffs, was multi-faceted—the officials “publicly threaten[ed] [the] 
          companies” while  they  privately piled on “unrelenting pressure” via 
          “demands for greater censorship.”  And they succeeded—the platforms 
          censored disfavored content.  
              The officials do not deny that they worked alongside the platforms. 
          Instead, they argue that their conduct—asking or trying to persuade the 
          platforms to act—was permissible government speech. So, we are left with 
          the task of sifting out any coercion and significant encouragement from their 
          attempts at persuasion. Here, there were multiple speakers and messages. 
          Taking that in context, we apply the law to one set of officials at a time, 
          starting with the White House and Office of the Surgeon General. 
                            1. 
              We find that the White House, acting in concert with the Surgeon 
          General’s office, likely (1) coerced the platforms to make their moderation 
          decisions by way of intimidating messages and threats of adverse 
          consequences, and (2) significantly encouraged the platforms’ decisions by 
          commandeering their decision-making processes, both in violation of the 
          First Amendment.  
              Generally speaking, officials from the White House and the Surgeon 
          General’s office had extensive, organized communications with platforms. 
                            42 
        Case: 23-30445      Document: 00516889176     Page: 43     Date Filed: 09/08/2023
                          No. 23-30445 
          They met regularly, traded information and reports, and worked together on 
          a wide range of efforts. That working relationship was, at times, sweeping. 
          Still, those facts alone likely are not problematic from a First-Amendment 
          perspective. But, the relationship between the officials and the platforms 
          went beyond that. In their communications with the platforms, the officials 
          went beyond advocating for policies, Southworth, 529 U.S. at 229, or making 
          no-strings-attached requests to moderate content, Warren, 66 F.4th at 1209. 
          Their interaction was “something more.” Roberts, 742 F.2d at 228. 
              We start with coercion. On multiple occasions, the officials coerced 
          the platforms into direct action via urgent, uncompromising demands to 
          moderate content. Privately, the officials were not shy in their requests—
          they asked the platforms to remove posts “ASAP” and accounts 
          “immediately,” and to “slow[] down” or “demote[]” content. In doing so, 
          the officials were persistent and angry. Cf. Bantam Books, 372 U.S. at 62–63. 
          When the platforms did not comply, officials followed up by asking why posts 
          were “still up,” stating (1) “how does something like [this] happen,” (2) 
          “what good is” flagging if it did not result in content moderation, (3) “I don’t 
          know why you guys can’t figure this out,” and (4) “you are hiding the ball,” 
          while demanding “assurances” that posts were being taken down. And, more 
          importantly, the officials threatened—both expressly and implicitly—to 
          retaliate against inaction. Officials threw out the prospect of legal reforms and 
          enforcement actions while subtly insinuating it would be in the platforms’ 
          best interests to comply. As one official put it, “removing bad information” 
          is “one of the easy, low-bar things you guys [can] do to make people like 
          me”—that is, White House officials—“think you’re taking action.” 
              That alone may be enough for us to find coercion. Like in Bantam 
          Books, the officials here set about to force the platforms to remove 
          metaphorical books from their shelves. It is uncontested that, between the 
          White House and the Surgeon General’s office, government officials asked 
                            43 
        Case: 23-30445      Document: 00516889176     Page: 44     Date Filed: 09/08/2023
                          No. 23-30445 
          the platforms to remove undesirable posts and users from their platforms, 
          sent follow-up messages of condemnation when they did not, and publicly 
          called on the platforms to act. When the officials’ demands were not met, the 
          platforms received promises of legal regime changes, enforcement actions, 
          and other unspoken threats. That was likely coercive. See Warren, 66 F.4th 
          at 1211–12. 
               That being said, even though coercion may have been readily 
          apparent here, we find it fitting to consult the Second Circuit’s four-factor 
          test for distinguishing coercion from persuasion. In asking whether the 
          officials’ messages can “reasonably be construed” as threats of adverse 
          consequences, we look to (1) the officials’ word choice and tone; (2) the 
          recipient’s perception; (3) the presence of authority; and (4) whether the 
          speaker refers to adverse consequences. Vullo, 49 F.4th at 715; see also 
          Warren, 66 F.4th at 1207.  
              First, the officials’ demeanor. We find, like the district court, that the 
          officials’ communications—reading them in “context, not in isolation”—
          were on-the-whole intimidating. Warren, 66 F.4th at 1208. In private 
          messages, the officials demanded “assurances” from the platforms that they 
          were moderating content in compliance with the officials’ requests, and used 
          foreboding, inflammatory, and hyper-critical phraseology when they 
          seemingly did not, like “you are hiding the ball,” you are not “trying to solve 
          the problem,” and we are “gravely concerned” that you are “one of the top 
          drivers of vaccine hesitancy.” In public, they said that the platforms were 
          irresponsible, let “misinformation [] poison” America, were “literally 
          costing . . . lives,” and were “killing people.” While officials are entitled to 
          “express their views and rally support for their positions,” the “word choice 
          and tone” applied here reveals something more than mere requests. Id. at 
          1207–08.  
                            44 
        Case: 23-30445      Document: 00516889176     Page: 45     Date Filed: 09/08/2023
                          No. 23-30445 
              Like Bantam Books—and unlike the requests in Warren—many of the 
          officials’ asks were “phrased virtually as orders,” 372 U.S. at 68, like 
          requests to remove content “ASAP” or “immediately.” The threatening 
          “tone” of the officials’ commands, as well as of their “overall interaction” 
          with the platforms, is made all the more evident when we consider the 
          persistent nature of their messages. Generally speaking, “[a]n interaction 
          will tend to be more threatening if the official refuses to take ‘no’ for an 
          answer and pesters the recipient until it succumbs.” Warren, 66 F.4th at 1209 
          (citing Bantam Books, 372 U.S. at 62–63). Urgency can have the same effect. 
          See Backpage.com, 807 F.3d at 237 (finding the “urgency” of a sheriff’s letter, 
          including a follow-up, “imposed another layer of coercion due to its strong 
          suggestion that the companies could not simply ignore” the sheriff), cert. 
          denied, 137 S. Ct. 46 (2016). Here, the officials’ correspondences were both 
          persistent and urgent. They sent repeated follow-up emails, whether to ask 
          why a post or account was “still up” despite being flagged or to probe deeper 
          into the platforms’ internal policies. On the latter point, for example, one 
          official asked at least twelve times for detailed information on Facebook’s 
          moderation practices and activities. Admittedly, many of the officials’ 
          communications are not by themselves coercive. But, we do not take a 
          speaker’s communications “in isolation.” Warren, 66 F.4th at 1208. Instead, 
          we look to the “tenor” of the parties’ relationship and the conduct of the 
          government in context. Id. at 1209. Given their treatment of the platforms as 
          a whole, we find the officials’ tone and demeanor was coercive, not merely 
          persuasive.  
              Second, we ask how the platforms perceived the communications. 
          Notably, “a credible threat may violate the First Amendment even if ‘the 
          victim ignores it, and the threatener folds his tent.’” Id. at 1210 (quoting 
          Backpage.com, 807 F.3d at 231). Still, it is more likely to be coercive if there is 
          some evidence that the recipient’s subsequent conduct is linked  to the 
                            45 
        Case: 23-30445      Document: 00516889176     Page: 46     Date Filed: 09/08/2023
                          No. 23-30445 
          official’s message. For example, in Warren, the Ninth Circuit court 
          concluded that Amazon’s decision to stop advertising a specific book was 
          “more likely . . . a response to widespread concerns about the spread of 
          COVID-19,” as there was “no evidence that the company changed [course] 
          in response to Senator Warren’s letter.” Id. at 1211. Here, there is plenty of 
          evidence—both direct and circumstantial, considering the platforms’ 
          contemporaneous actions—that the platforms were influenced by the 
          officials’ demands. When officials asked for content to be removed, the 
          platforms took it down. And, when they asked for the platforms to be more 
          aggressive, “interven[e]” more often, take quicker actions, and modify their 
          “internal policies,” the platforms did—and they sent emails and assurances 
          confirming as much. For example, as was common after public critiques, one 
          platform assured the officials they were “committed to addressing the [] 
          misinformation that you’ve called on us to address” after the White House 
          issued a public statement. Another time, one company promised to make an 
          employee “available on a regular basis” so that the platform could 
          “automatically prioritize” the officials’ requests after criticism of the 
          platform’s response time. Yet another time, a platform said it was going to 
          “adjust [its] policies” to include “specific recommendations for 
          improvement” from the officials, and emailed as much because they 
          “want[ed] to make sure to keep you informed of our work on each” change. 
          Those are just a few of many examples of the platforms changing—and 
          acknowledging as much—their course as a direct result of the officials’ 
          messages. 
              Third, we turn to whether the speaker has “authority over the 
          recipient.” 66 F.4th at 1210. Here, that is clearly the case. As an initial 
          matter, the White House wields significant power in this Nation’s 
          constitutional landscape. It enforces the laws of our country, U.S. Const. 
          art. II, and—as the head of the executive branch—directs an army of federal 
                            46 
        Case: 23-30445      Document: 00516889176     Page: 47     Date Filed: 09/08/2023
                          No. 23-30445 
          agencies that create, modify, and enforce federal regulations. We can hardly 
          say that, like the senator in Warren, the White House is “removed from the 
          relevant levers of power.” 66 F.4th at 1210. At the very least, as agents of the 
          executive branch, the officials’ powers track somewhere closer to those of 
          the commission in Bantam Books—they were legislatively given the power to 
          “investigate violations[] and recommend prosecutions.” Id. (citing Bantam 
          Books, 372 U.S. at 66).  
              But, authority over the recipient does not have to be a clearly-defined 
          ability to act under the close nexus test. Instead, a generalized, non-descript 
          means to punish the recipient may suffice depending on the circumstances. 
          As the Ninth Circuit explained in Warren, a message may be “inherently 
          coercive” if, for example, it was conveyed by a “law enforcement officer” or 
          “penned by an executive official with unilateral power.” Id. (emphasis 
          added). In other words, a speaker’s power may stem from an inherent 
          authority over the recipient. See, e.g.,  Backpage.com, 807 F.3d 229. That 
          reasoning is likely applicable here, too, given the officials’ executive status.  
              It is not even necessary that an official have direct power over the 
          recipient. Even if the officials “lack[ed] direct authority” over the platforms, 
          the cloak of authority may still satisfy the authority prong. See Warren, 66 
          F.4th at 1210. After all, we ask whether a “reasonable person” would be 
          threatened by an official’s statements. Id. Take, for example, Okwedy. There, 
          a borough president penned a letter to a company—which, per the official, 
          owned a “number of billboards on Staten Island and derive[d] substantial 
          economic benefits from them”—and “call[ed] on [them] as a responsible 
          member of the business community to please contact” his “legal counsel.” 
          333 F.3d at 342. The Second Circuit found that, even though the official 
          “lacked direct regulatory authority” or control over the company, an 
          “implicit threat” flowed from his letter because he had some innate authority 
          to affect the company. Id. at 344. The Second Circuit noted that “[a]lthough 
                            47 
                 Case: 23-30445      Document: 00516889176     Page: 48     Date Filed: 09/08/2023
                                                     No. 23-30445 
                     the existence of regulatory or other direct decisionmaking authority is 
                     certainly relevant to the question of whether a government official’s 
                     comments were unconstitutionally threatening or coercive, a defendant 
                     without such direct regulatory or decisionmaking authority can also exert an 
                     impermissible type or degree of pressure.” Id. at 343.  
                            Consider another example, Backpage.com. There, a sheriff sent a 
                     cease-and-desist letter to credit card companies—which he admittedly “had 
                     no authority to take any official action” against—to stop doing business with 
                     a website. 807 F.3d at 230, 236. “[E]ven if the companies understood the 
                     jurisdictional constraints on [the sheriff]’s ability to proceed against them 
                     directly,” the sheriff’s letter was still coercive because, among other reasons, 
                     it “invok[ed] the legal obligations of [the recipients] to cooperate with law 
                     enforcement,” and the sheriff could easily “refer the credit card companies 
                                                                                  16
                     to the appropriate authority to investigate” their dealings,  much like a 
                     White House official could contact the Department of Justice. Id. at 236–37.  
                            True, the government can “appeal[]” to a private party’s “interest in 
                     avoiding liability” so long as that reference is not meant to intimidate or 
                     compel. Id. at 237; see also Vullo, 49 F.4th at 717–19 (statements were non-
                     coercive because they referenced legitimate use of powers in a 
                            _____________________ 
                            16
                              This was true even though the financial institutions were large, sophisticated, 
                     and presumably understood the federal authorities were unlikely to prosecute the 
                     companies. Backpage.com, 807 F.3d at 234. As the Seventh Circuit explained, it was still in 
                     the credit card companies’ financial interests to comply. Backpage’s measly $135 million 
                     in annual revenue was a drop in the bucket of the financial service companies’ combined 
                     net revenue of $22 billion. Id. at 236. Unlike credit card processors that at least made money 
                     servicing Backpage, social-media platforms typically depend on advertisers, not their users, 
                     for revenue. Cf. Wash. Post v. McManus, 944 F.3d 506, 516 (4th Cir. 2019) (holding 
                     campaign finance regulations on online ads unconstitutional where they “ma[de] it 
                     financially irrational, generally speaking, for platforms to carry political speech when other, 
                     more profitable options are available”). 
                                                          48 
                 Case: 23-30445      Document: 00516889176     Page: 49     Date Filed: 09/08/2023
                                                     No. 23-30445 
                     nonthreatening manner). But here, the officials’ demands that the platforms 
                     remove content and change their practices were backed by the officials’ 
                     unilateral power to act or, at the very least, their ability to inflict “some form 
                                                           17
                     of punishment” against the platforms.  Okwedy, 333 F.3d at 342 (citation 
                     omitted) (emphasis added). Therefore, the authority factor weighs in favor 
                     of finding the officials’ messages coercive. 
                            Finally, and “perhaps most important[ly],” we ask whether the 
                     speaker “refers to adverse consequences that will follow if the recipient does 
                     not accede to the request.” Warren, 66 F.4th at 1211 (citing Vullo, 49 F.4th 
                     at 715). Explicit and subtle threats both work— “an official does not need to 
                     say ‘or else’ if a threat is clear from the context.” Id. (citing Backpage.com, 
                     807 F.3d at 234). Again, this factor is met.  
                            Here, the officials made express threats and, at the very least, leaned 
                     into the inherent authority of the President’s office. The officials made 
                     inflammatory accusations, such as saying that the platforms were 
                     “poison[ing]” the public, and “killing people.” The platforms were told they 
                     needed to take greater responsibility and action. Then, they followed their 
                     statements with threats of “fundamental reforms” like regulatory changes 
                     and increased enforcement actions that would ensure the platforms were 
                     “held accountable.” But, beyond express threats, there was always  an 
                     “unspoken ‘or else.’” Warren, 66 F.4th at 1212. After all, as the executive of 
                     the Nation, the President wields awesome power. The officials were not shy 
                     to allude to that understanding native to every American—when the 
                     platforms faltered, the officials warned them that they were 
                            _____________________ 
                            17
                              Or, as the Ninth Circuit put it, “public officials may criticize practices that they 
                     would have no constitutional ability to regulate, so long as there is no actual or threatened 
                     imposition of government power or sanction.” Warren, 66 F.4th at 1207 (citation omitted) 
                     (emphasis added).

                     “[i]nternally . . . considering our options on what to do,” their “concern[s] 
                     [were] shared at the highest (and I mean highest) levels of the [White 
                     House],” and the “President has long been concerned about the power of 
                     large social media platforms.” Unlike the letter in Warren, the language 
                     deployed in the officials’ campaign reveals clear “plan[s] to punish” the 
                     platforms if they did not surrender. Warren, 66 F.4th at 1209. Compare id., 
                     with Backpage.com, 807 F.3d at 237. Consequently, the four-factor test weighs 
                     heavily in favor of finding the officials’ messages were coercive, not 
                     persuasive.  
                            Notably, the Ninth Circuit recently reviewed a case that is strikingly 
                     similar to ours. In O’Handley, officials from the California Secretary of 
                     State’s office allegedly “act[ed] in concert” with Twitter to censor speech 
                     on the platform. 62 F.4th at 1153. Specifically, the parties had a 
                     “collaborative relationship” where officials flagged tweets and Twitter 
                     “almost invariably” took them down. Id. Therefore, the plaintiff contended, 
                     when his election-fraud-based post was removed, California “abridged his 
                     freedom of speech” because it had “pressured Twitter to remove disfavored 
                     content.” Id. at 1163. But, the Ninth Circuit disagreed, finding the close 
                     nexus test was not satisfied. The court reasoned that there was no clear 
                     indication that Twitter “would suffer adverse consequences if it refused” to 
                     comply with California’s request. Id. at 1158. Instead, it was a “purely 
                     optional,” “no strings attached” request. Id. Consequently, “Twitter 
                     complied with the request under the terms of its own content-moderation

                              The Ninth Circuit insightfully noted the difficult task of applying the coercion 
                     test in the First Amendment context:  
                            [W]e have drawn a sharp distinction between attempts to convince and 
                            attempts to coerce. Particularly relevant here, we have held that 
                            government officials do not violate the First Amendment when they 
                                                         50 
        Case: 23-30445      Document: 00516889176     Page: 51     Date Filed: 09/08/2023
                          No. 23-30445 
          there was no indication—whether via tone, content, or otherwise—that the 
          state would retaliate against inaction given the insubstantial relationship. 
          Ultimately, the officials conduct was “far from the type of coercion” seen in 
          cases like Bantam Books. Id. In contrast, here, the officials made clear that the 
          platforms would suffer adverse consequences if they failed to comply, through 
          express or implied threats, and thus the requests were not optional. 
              Given all of the above, we are left only with the conclusion that the 
          officials’ statements were coercive. That conclusion tracks with the decisions 
          of other courts. After reviewing the four-factor test, it is apparent that the 
          officials’ messages could “reasonably be construed” as threats. Warren, 66 
          F.4th at 1208; Vullo, 49 F.4th at 716. Here, unlike in Warren, the officials’ 
          “call[s] to action”—given the context and officials’ tone, the presence of 
          some authority, the platforms’ yielding responses, and the officials’ express 
          and implied references to adverse consequences—“directly suggest[ed] that 
          compliance was the only realistic option to avoid government sanction.” 66 
          F.4th at 1208. And, unlike O’Handley, the officials were not simply flagging 
          posts with “no strings attached,” 62 F.4th at 1158—they did much, much 
          more.  
              _____________________ 
              request that a private intermediary not carry a third party’s speech so long 
              as the officials do not threaten adverse consequences if the intermediary 
              refuses to comply. This distinction tracks core First Amendment 
              principles. A private party can find the government’s stated reasons for 
              making a request persuasive, just as it can be moved by any other speaker’s 
              message. The First Amendment does not interfere with this 
              communication so long as the intermediary is free to disagree with the 
              government and to make its own independent judgment about whether to 
              comply with the government’s request. 
          O’Handley, 62 F.4th at 1158. After all, consistent with their constitutional and statutory 
          authority, state “[a]gencies are permitted to communicate in a non-threatening manner 
          with the entities they oversee without creating a constitutional violation.” Id. at 1163 (citing 
          Vullo, 49 F.4th at 714–19).

                          No. 23-30445 
              Now, we turn to encouragement. We find that the officials also 
          significantly encouraged the platforms to moderate content by exercising 
          active, meaningful control over those decisions. Specifically, the officials 
          entangled themselves in the platforms’ decision-making processes, namely 
          their moderation policies. See Blum, 457 U.S. at 1008. That active, 
          meaningful control is evidenced plainly by a view of the record. The officials 
          had consistent and consequential interaction with the platforms and 
          constantly monitored their moderation activities. In doing so, they repeatedly 
          communicated their concerns, thoughts, and desires to the platforms. The 
          platforms responded with cooperation—they invited the officials to 
          meetings, roundups, and policy discussions. And, more importantly, they 
          complied with the officials’ requests, including making changes to their 
          policies. 
              The officials began with simple enough asks of the platforms—“can 
          you share more about your framework here” or “do you have data on the 
          actual number” of removed posts? But, the tenor later changed. When the 
          platforms’ policies were not performing to the officials’ liking, they pressed 
          for more, persistently asking what “interventions” were being taken, “how 
          much content [was] being demoted,” and why certain posts were not being 
          removed. Eventually, the officials pressed for outright change to the 
          platforms’ moderation policies. They did so privately and publicly. One 
          official emailed a list of proposed changes and said, “this is circulating around 
          the building and informing thinking.” The White House Press Secretary 
          called on the platforms to adopt “proposed changes” that would create a 
          more “robust enforcement strategy.” And the Surgeon General published an 
          advisory calling on the platforms to “[e]valuate the effectiveness of [their] 
          internal policies” and implement changes. Beyond that, they relentlessly 
          asked the platforms to remove content, even giving reasons as to why such 
                            52 
        Case: 23-30445      Document: 00516889176     Page: 53     Date Filed: 09/08/2023
                          No. 23-30445 
          content should be taken down. They also followed up to ensure compliance 
          and, when met with a response, asked how the internal decision was made. 
              And, the officials’ campaign succeeded. The platforms, in 
          capitulation to state-sponsored pressure, changed their moderation policies. 
          The platforms explicitly recognized that. For example, one platform told the 
          White House it was “making a number of changes”—which aligned with the 
          officials’ demands—as it knew its “position on [misinformation] continues 
          to be a particular concern” for the White House. The platform noted that, in 
          line with the officials’ requests, it would “make sure that these additional 
          [changes] show results—the stronger demotions in particular should deliver 
          real impact.” Similarly, one platform emailed a list of “commitments” after 
          a meeting with the White House which included policy “changes” “focused 
          on reducing the virality” of anti-vaccine content even when it “does not 
          contain actionable misinformation.”  Relatedly, one platform told the 
          Surgeon General that it was “committed to addressing the [] misinformation 
          that you’ve called on us to address,” including by implementing a set of 
          jointly proposed policy changes from the White House and the Surgeon 
          General. 
              Consequently, it is apparent that the officials exercised meaningful 
          control—via changes to the platforms’ independent processes—over the 
          platforms’ moderation decisions. By pushing changes to the platforms’ 
          policies through their expansive relationship with and informal oversight 
          over the platforms, the officials imparted a lasting influence on the platforms’ 
          moderation decisions without the need for any further input. In doing so, the 
          officials ensured that any moderation decisions were not made in accordance 
          with independent judgments guided by independent standards. See id.; see 
          also Am. Mfrs., 526 U.S. at 52 (“The decision to withhold payment, like the 
          decision to transfer Medicaid patients to a lower level of care in Blum, is made 
          by concededly private parties, and ‘turns on . . . judgments made by private 
                            53 
        Case: 23-30445      Document: 00516889176     Page: 54     Date Filed: 09/08/2023
                          No. 23-30445 
          parties’ without ‘standards . . . established by the State.’”). Instead, they 
          were encouraged by the officials’ imposed standards. 
              In sum, we find that the White House officials, in conjunction with the 
          Surgeon General’s office, coerced and significantly encouraged the platforms 
          to moderate content. As a result, the platforms’ actions “must in law be 
          deemed to be that of the State.” Blum, 457 U.S. at 1004. 
                            2. 
              Next, we consider the FBI. We find that the FBI, too, likely (1) 
          coerced the platforms into moderating content, and (2) encouraged them to 
          do so by effecting changes to their moderation policies, both in violation of 
          the First Amendment. 
              We start with coercion. Similar to the White House, Surgeon General, 
          and CDC officials, the FBI regularly met with the platforms, shared 
          “strategic information,” frequently alerted the social media companies to 
          misinformation spreading on their platforms, and monitored their content 
          moderation policies. But, the FBI went beyond that—they urged the 
          platforms to take down content. Turning to the Second Circuit’s four-factor 
          test, we find that those requests were coercive. Vullo, 49 F.4th at 715. 
              First, given the record before us, we cannot say that the FBI’s 
          messages were plainly threatening in tone or manner. Id. But, second, we do 
          find the FBI’s requests came with the backing of clear authority over the 
          platforms. After all, content moderation requests “might be inherently 
          coercive if sent by . . . [a] law enforcement officer.” Warren, 66 F.4th at 1210 
          (citations omitted); see also Zieper v. Metzinger, 392 F. Supp. 2d 516, 531 
          (S.D.N.Y. 2005) (holding that a reasonable jury could find an FBI agent’s 
          request coercive when he asked an internet service provider to take down a 
          controversial video that could be “inciting a riot” because he was “an FBI 
          agent charged with investigating the video”); Backpage, 807 F.3d at 234 
                            54 
        Case: 23-30445      Document: 00516889176     Page: 55     Date Filed: 09/08/2023
                          No. 23-30445 
          (“[C]redit card companies don’t like being threatened by a law-enforcement 
          official that he will sic the feds on them, even if the threat may be empty.”). 
          This is especially true of the lead law enforcement, investigatory, and 
          domestic security agency for the executive branch. Consequently, because 
          the FBI wielded some authority over the platforms, see Okwedy, 333 F.3d at 
          344, the FBI’s takedown requests can “reasonably be construed” as coercive 
          in nature, Warren, 66 F.4th at 1210.  
              Third, although the FBI’s communications did not plainly reference 
          adverse consequences, an actor need not express a threat aloud so long as, 
          given the circumstances, the message intimates that some form of 
          punishment will follow noncompliance. Id. at 1209. Here, beyond its inherent 
          authority, the FBI—unlike most federal actors—also has tools at its disposal 
          to force a platform to take down content. For instance, in Zieper, an FBI agent 
          asked a web-hosting platform to take down a video portraying an imaginary 
          documentary showing preparations for a military takeover of Times Square 
          on the eve of the new millennium. 392 F. Supp. 2d at 520–21. In appealing to 
          the platform, the FBI agent said that he was concerned that the video could 
          be “inciting a riot” and testified that he was trying to appeal to the platform’s 
          “‘good citizenship’ by pointing out a public safety concern.” Id. at 531. And 
          these appeals to the platform’s “good citizenship” worked—the platform 
          took down the video. Id.  at 519. The Southern District of New York 
          concluded that a reasonable jury could find that statement coercive, 
          “particularly when said by an FBI agent charged with investigating the 
          video.” Id. at 531. Indeed, the question is whether a message intimates that 
          some form of punishment that may be used against the recipient, an analysis 
          that includes means of retaliation that are not readily apparent. See Warren, 
          66 F.4th at 1210.  
              Fourth, the platforms clearly perceived the FBI’s messages as threats. 
          For example, right before the 2022 congressional election, the FBI warned 
                            55 
                 Case: 23-30445      Document: 00516889176     Page: 56     Date Filed: 09/08/2023
                                                     No. 23-30445 
                     the platforms of “hack and dump” operations from “state-sponsored 
                     actors” that would spread misinformation through their sites. In doing so, 
                     the FBI officials leaned into their inherent authority. So, the platforms 
                     reacted as expected—by taking down content, including posts and accounts 
                     that originated from the United States, in direct compliance with the request. 
                     Considering the above, we conclude that the FBI coerced the platforms into 
                     moderating content. But, the FBI’s endeavors did not stop there. 
                            We also find that the FBI likely significantly encouraged the platforms 
                     to moderate content by entangling themselves in the platforms’ decision-
                     making processes. Blum, 457 U.S. at 1008. Beyond taking down posts, the 
                     platforms also changed their terms of service in concert with 
                     recommendations from the FBI. For example, several platforms “adjusted” 
                     their moderation policies to capture “hack-and-leak” content after the FBI 
                     asked them to do so (and followed up on that request). Consequently, when 
                     the platforms subsequently moderated content that violated their newly 
                     modified terms of service (e.g., the results of hack-and-leaks), they did not do 
                     so via independent standards. See Blum, 457 U.S. at 1008. Instead, those 
                     decisions were made subject to commandeered moderation policies. 
                            In short, when the platforms acted, they did so in response to the 
                     FBI’s inherent authority and based on internal policies influenced by FBI 
                     officials. Taking those facts together, we find the platforms’ decisions were 
                                                                      19
                     significantly encouraged and coerced by the FBI.

                              Plaintiffs and several amici assert that the FBI and other federal actors coerced 
                     or significantly encouraged the social-media companies into disseminating information that 
                     was favorable to the administration—information the federal officials knew was false or 
                     misleading.  We express no opinion on those assertions because they are not necessary to 
                     our holding here. 
                                                          56 
        Case: 23-30445      Document: 00516889176     Page: 57     Date Filed: 09/08/2023
                          No. 23-30445 
                            3. 
              Next, we turn to the CDC. We find that, although not plainly coercive, 
          the CDC officials likely significantly encouraged the platforms’ moderation 
          decisions, meaning they violated the First Amendment.  
              We start with coercion. Here, like the other officials, the CDC 
          regularly met with the platforms and frequently flagged content for removal. 
          But, unlike the others, the CDC’s requests for removal were not coercive—
          they did not ask the platforms in an intimidating or threatening manner, do 
          not possess any clear authority over the platforms, and did not allude to any 
          adverse consequences. Consequently, we cannot say the platforms’ 
          moderation decisions were coerced by CDC officials. 
              The same, however, cannot be said for significant encouragement. 
          Ultimately, the CDC was entangled in the platforms’ decision-making 
          processes, Blum, 457 U.S. at 1008.  
              The CDC’s relationship with the platforms began by defining—in 
          “Be On the Lookout” meetings—what was (and was not) “misinformation” 
          for the platforms. Specifically, CDC officials issued “advisories” to the 
          platforms warning them about misinformation “hot topics” to be wary of. 
          From there, CDC officials instructed the platforms to label disfavored posts 
          with “contextual information,” and asked for “amplification” of approved 
          content. That led to CDC officials becoming intimately involved in the 
          various platforms’ day-to-day moderation decisions. For example, they 
          communicated about how a platform’s “moderation team” reached a certain 
          decision, how it was “approach[ing] adding labels” to particular content, and 
          how it was deploying manpower. Consequently, the CDC garnered an 
          extensive relationship with the platforms. 
              From that relationship, the CDC, through authoritative guidance, 
          directed changes to the platforms’ moderation policies. At first, the 
                            57 
        Case: 23-30445      Document: 00516889176     Page: 58     Date Filed: 09/08/2023
                          No. 23-30445 
          platforms asked CDC officials to decide whether certain claims were 
          misinformation. In response, CDC officials told the platforms whether such 
          claims were true or false, and whether information was “misleading” or 
          needed to be addressed via CDC-backed labels. That back-and-forth then led 
          to “[s]omething more.” Roberts, 742 F.2d at 228.  
              Specifically, CDC officials directly impacted the platforms’ 
          moderation policies. For example, in meetings with the CDC, the platforms 
          actively sought to “get into [] policy stuff” and run their moderation policies 
          by the CDC to determine whether the platforms’ standards were “in the 
          right place.” Ultimately, the platforms came to heavily rely on the CDC. They 
          adopted rule changes meant to implement the CDC’s guidance. As one 
          platform said, they “were able to make [changes to the ‘misinfo policies’] 
          based on the conversation [they] had last week with the CDC,” and they 
          “immediately updated [their] policies globally” following another meeting. 
          And, those adoptions led the platforms to make moderation decisions based 
          entirely on the CDC’s say-so—“[t]here are several claims that we will be 
          able to remove as soon as the CDC debunks them; until then, we are unable 
          to remove them.” That dependence, at times, was total. For example, one 
          platform asked the CDC how it should approach certain content and even 
          asked the CDC to double check and proofread its proposed labels. 
              Viewing these facts, we are left with no choice but to conclude that the 
          CDC significantly encouraged the platforms’ moderation decisions. Unlike 
          in Blum, the platforms’ decisions were not made by independent standards, 
          457 U.S. at 1008, but instead were marred by modification from CDC 
          officials. Thus, the resulting content moderation, “while not compelled by 
          the state, was so significantly encouraged, both overtly and covertly” by 
          CDC officials that those decisions “must in law be deemed to be that of the 
          state.”  Howard Gault, 848 F.2d at 555 (alterations adopted) (internal 
          quotation marks and citation omitted).

                            4. 
              Finally, we address the remaining officials—the NIAID, the State 
          Department, and CISA. Having reviewed the record, we find the district 
          court erred in enjoining these other officials. Put simply, there was not, at this 
          stage, sufficient evidence to find that it was likely these groups coerced or 
          significantly encouragement the platforms.  
              For the NIAID officials, it is not apparent that they ever 
          communicated with the social-media platforms. Instead, the record shows, at 
          most, that public statements by Director Anthony Fauci and other NIAID 
          officials promoted the government’s scientific and policy views and 
          attempted to discredit opposing ones—quintessential examples of 
          government speech that do not run afoul of the First Amendment. See 
          Pleasant Grove City v. Summum, 555 U.S. 460, 467–68 (2009) (“[The 
          government] is entitled to say what it wishes, and to select the views that it 
          wants to express.” (quotation marks and citations omitted)); Nat’l 
          Endowment for Arts v. Finley, 524 U.S. 569, 598 (1998) (Scalia, J., concurring) 
          (“It is the very business of government to favor and disfavor points of 
          view . . . .”). Consequently, with only insignificant (if any) communication 
          (direct or indirect) with the platforms, we cannot say that the NIAID officials 
          likely coerced or encouraged the platforms to act. 
              As for the State Department, while it did communicate directly with 
          the platforms, so far there is no evidence these communications went beyond 
          educating the platforms on “tools and techniques” used by foreign actors. 
          There is no indication that  State Department officials flagged specific 
          content for censorship, suggested policy changes to the platforms, or engaged 
          in any similar actions that would reasonably bring their conduct within the 
          scope of the First Amendment’s prohibitions. After all, their messages do not 
          appear coercive in tone, did not refer to adverse consequences, and were not 
                            59 
        Case: 23-30445      Document: 00516889176     Page: 60     Date Filed: 09/08/2023
                          No. 23-30445 
          backed by any apparent authority. And, per this record, those officials were 
          not involved to any meaningful extent with the platforms’ moderation 
          decisions or standards.   
              Finally, although CISA flagged content for social-media platforms as 
          part of its switchboarding operations, based on this record, its conduct falls 
          on the “attempts to convince,” not “attempts to coerce,” side of the line. 
          See Okwedy, 333 F.3d at 344; O’Handley, 62 F.4th at 1158. There is not 
          sufficient evidence that CISA made threats of adverse consequences—
          explicit or implicit—to the platforms for refusing to act on the content it 
          flagged.  See Warren,  66 F.4th at 1208–11 (finding that senator’s 
          communication was a “request rather than a command” where it did not 
          “suggest[] that compliance was the only realistic option” or reference 
          potential “adverse consequences”). Nor is there any indication CISA had 
          power over the platforms in any capacity, or that their requests were 
          threatening in tone or manner. Similarly, on this record, their requests—
          although certainly amounting to a non-trivial level of involvement—do not 
          equate to meaningful control. There is no plain evidence that content was 
          actually moderated per CISA’s requests or that any such moderation was 
          done subject to non-independent standards. 
                           *   *   * 
              Ultimately, we find the district court did not err in determining that 
          several officials—namely the White House, the Surgeon General, the CDC, 
          and the FBI—likely coerced or significantly encouraged social-media 
                            60 
                Case: 23-30445      Document: 00516889176     Page: 61     Date Filed: 09/08/2023

                     platforms to moderate content, rendering those decisions state actions.  In 
                                                                              21
                     doing so, the officials likely violated the First Amendment.  
                            But, we emphasize the limited reach of our decision today. We do not 
                     uphold the injunction against all the officials named in the complaint. Indeed, 
                     many of those officials were permissibly exercising government speech, 
                     “carrying out [their] responsibilities,” or merely “engaging in [a] legitimate 
                     [] action.” Vullo, 49 F.4th at 718–19. That distinction is important because 
                     the state-action doctrine is vitally important to our Nation’s operation—by 
                     distinguishing between the state and the People, it promotes “a robust sphere 
                     of individual liberty.” Halleck, 139 S. Ct. at 1928. That is why the Supreme 
                     Court has been reluctant to expand the scope of the doctrine. See Matal v. 
                     Tan, 582 U.S. 218, 235 (2017) (“[W]e must exercise great caution before 
                     extending our government-speech precedents.”). If just any relationship 
                     with the government “sufficed to transform a private entity into a state actor, 
                     a large swath of private entities in America would suddenly be turned into 
                     state actors and be subject to a variety of constitutional constraints on their 
                     activities.” Halleck, 139 S. Ct. at 1932. So, we do not take our decision today 
                     lightly. But, the Supreme Court has rarely been faced with a coordinated 
                     campaign of this magnitude orchestrated by federal officials that jeopardized 
                     a fundamental aspect of American life. Therefore, the district court was 
                     correct in its assessment—“unrelenting pressure” from certain government

                              Here, in holding that some of the officials likely coerced or sufficiently 
                     encouraged the platforms to censor content, we pass no judgment on any joint actor or 
                     conspiracy-based state action theory.  
                            21 “With very limited exceptions, none applicable to this case, censorship—‘an

                     of the categories of punishable speech, such as defamation or threats) after it has 
                     occurred—is prohibited by the First Amendment as it has been understood by the courts.”

                     discretion in that finding.  
                                                         V. 
                            Next, we address the equities.  Plaintiffs seeking a preliminary 
                     injunction must show that irreparable injury is “likely” absent an injunction, 
                     the balance of the equities weighs in their favor, and an injunction is in the 
                     public interest. Winter v. Nat. Res. Def. Council, Inc., 555 U.S. 7, 22 (2008) 
                     (collecting cases).  
                            While “[t]he loss of First Amendment freedoms, for even minimal 
                     periods of time, unquestionably constitutes irreparable injury,” Roman Cath. 
                     Diocese of Brooklyn v. Cuomo, 141 S. Ct. 63, 67 (2020) (per curiam) (quoting 
                     Elrod v. Burns, 427 U.S. 347, 373 (1976) (plurality opinion)), “invocation of 
                     the First Amendment cannot substitute for the presence of an imminent, 
                     non-speculative irreparable injury,” Google, Inc. v. Hood, 822 F.3d 212, 228 
                     (5th Cir. 2016). 
                            Here, the district court found that the Plaintiffs submitted enough 
                     evidence to show that irreparable injury is likely to occur during the pendency 
                     of the litigation. In so doing, the district court rejected the officials’ 
                     arguments that the challenged conduct had ceased and that future harm was 
                     speculative, drawing on mootness and standing doctrines. Applying the 
                     standard for mootness, the district court concluded that a defendant must

                              Our holding today, as is appropriate under the state-action doctrine, is limited. 
                     Like in Roberts, we narrowly construe today’s finding of state action to apply only to the 
                     challenged decisions. See 742 F.2d at 228 (“We do not doubt that many of the actions of 
                     the racetrack and its employees are no more than private business decisions,” but “[i]n the 
                     area of stalling, [] state regulation and involvement is so specific and so pervasive that 
                     [such] decisions may be considered to bear the imprimatur of the state.”).

        Case: 23-30445      Document: 00516889176     Page: 63     Date Filed: 09/08/2023
                          No. 23-30445 
          show that “it is absolutely clear the alleged wrongful behavior could not 
          reasonably be expected to recur” and that the officials had failed to make 
          such showing here. In assessing whether Plaintiffs’ claims of future harm 
          were speculative and dependent on the actions of social-media companies, 
          the district court applied a quasi-standing analysis and found that the 
          Plaintiffs had alleged a “substantial risk” of future harm that is not 
          “imaginary or wholly speculative,” pointing to the officials’ ongoing 
          coordination with social-media companies and willingness to suppress free 
          speech on a myriad of hot-button issues.  
              We agree that the Plaintiffs have shown that they are likely to suffer 
          an irreparable injury. Deprivation of First Amendment rights, even for a 
          short period, is sufficient to establish irreparable injury. Elrod, 427 U.S. at 
          373; Cuomo, 141 S. Ct. at 67; Opulent Life Church v. City of Holly Springs, 697 
          F.3d 279, 295 (5th Cir. 2012).  
              The district court was right to be skeptical of the officials’ claims that 
          they had stopped all challenged conduct. Cf. Speech First, Inc. v. Fenves, 979 
          F.3d 319, 328 (5th Cir. 2020) (“[A] defendant’s voluntary cessation of a 
          challenged practice does not deprive a federal court of its power to determine 
          the legality of the practice, even in cases in which injunctive relief is 
          sought.”). But, the district court’s use of a “not imaginary or speculative” 
          standard in the irreparable harm context is inconsistent with binding case law. 
          See Winter, 555 U.S. at 22 (“Issuing a preliminary injunction based only on a 
          possibility of irreparable harm is inconsistent with our characterization of 
          injunctive relief as an extraordinary remedy that may only be awarded upon 
          a clear showing that the plaintiff is entitled to such relief.” (citation omitted) 
          (emphasis added)). The correct standard is whether a future injury is 
          “likely.” Id. But, because the Plaintiffs sufficiently demonstrated that their 
          First Amendment interests are either threatened or impaired, they have met 
          this standard. See Opulent Life Church, 697 F.3d at 295 (citing 11A Charles 
                            63 
        Case: 23-30445      Document: 00516889176     Page: 64     Date Filed: 09/08/2023
                          No. 23-30445 
          Alan Wright et al., Federal Practice and Procedure § 2948.1 (2d ed. 1995) 
          (“When an alleged deprivation of a constitutional right is involved, most 
          courts hold that no further showing of irreparable injury is necessary.”)). 
          Indeed, the record shows, and counsel confirmed at oral argument, that the 
          officials’ challenged conduct has not stopped. 
              Next, we turn to whether the balance of the equities warrants an 
          injunction and whether such relief is in the public interest. Where the 
          government is the opposing party, harm to the opposing party and the public 
          interest “merge.” Nken v. Holder, 556 U.S. 418, 435 (2009).  
              The district court concluded that the equities weighed in favor of 
          granting the injunction because the injunction maintains the “constitutional 
          structure” and Plaintiffs’ free speech rights. The officials argue that the 
          district court gave short shrift to their assertions that the injunction could 
          limit the Executive Branch’s ability to “persuade” the American public, 
          which raises separation-of-powers issues. 
              Although both Plaintiffs and the officials assert that their ability to 
          speak is affected by the injunction, the government is not permitted to use 
          the government-speech doctrine to “silence or muffle the expression of 
          disfavored viewpoints.” Matal, 582 U.S. at 235. 
              It is true that the officials have an interest in engaging with social-
          media companies, including on issues such as misinformation and election 
          interference. But the government is not permitted to advance these interests 
          to the extent that it engages in viewpoint suppression. Because “[i]njunctions 
          protecting First Amendment freedoms are always in the public interest,” the 
          equities weigh in Plaintiffs’ favor. Opulent Life Church, 697 F.3d at 298 
          (quotation marks and citations omitted). 
                            64

                          No. 23-30445 
              While the officials raise legitimate concerns that the injunction could 
          sweep in lawful speech, we have addressed those concerns by modifying the 
          scope of the injunction.  
                            VI. 
              Finally, we turn to the language of the injunction itself. An injunction 
          “is overbroad if it is not ‘narrowly tailored to remedy the specific action 
          which gives rise to the order’ as determined by the substantive law at issue.” 
          Scott v. Schedler, 826 F.3d 207, 211 (5th Cir. 2016) (alterations adopted) 
          (quoting John Doe #1 v. Veneman, 380 F.3d 807, 818 (5th Cir. 2004)). This 
          requirement that a “plaintiff’s remedy must be tailored to redress the 
          plaintiff’s particular injury” is in recognition of a federal court’s 
          “constitutionally prescribed role . . . to vindicate the individual rights of the 
          people appearing before it,” not “generalized partisan preferences.” Gill v. 
          Whitford, 138 S. Ct. 1916, 1933–34 (2018). 
              In addition, injunctions cannot be vague. “Every order granting an 
          injunction . . . must: (A) state the reasons why it issued; (B) state its terms 
          specifically; and (C) describe in reasonable detail—and not by referring to 
          the complaint or other document—the act or acts restrained or required.” 
          Fed. R. Civ. P. 65(d)(1). The Supreme Court has explained: 
              [T]he specificity provisions of Rule 65(d) are no mere technical 
              requirements. The Rule was designed to prevent uncertainty 
              and confusion on the part of those faced with injunctive orders, 
              and to avoid the possible founding of a contempt citation on a 
              decree too vague to be understood. Since an injunctive order 
              prohibits conduct under threat of judicial punishment, basic 
              fairness requires that those enjoined receive explicit notice of 
              precisely what conduct is outlawed.

          Schmidt v. Lessard, 414 U.S. 473, 476 (1974) (citations omitted).  
              To be sure, “[t]he specificity requirement is not unwieldy,” Meyer v. 
          Brown & Root Construction Co., 661 F.2d 369, 373 (5th Cir. 1981), and 
          “elaborate detail is unnecessary,” Islander E. Rental Program v. Barfield, No. 
          96-41275, 1998 WL 307564, at *4 (5th Cir. Mar. 24, 1998). But still, “an 
          ordinary person reading the court’s order should be able to ascertain from 
          the document itself exactly what conduct is proscribed.” Louisiana v. Biden, 
          45 F.4th at 846 (citation omitted). 
              The preliminary injunction here is both vague and broader than 
          necessary to remedy the Plaintiffs’ injuries, as shown at this preliminary 
          juncture. As an initial matter, it is axiomatic that an injunction is overbroad 
          if it enjoins a defendant from engaging in legal conduct. Nine of the 
          preliminary injunction’s ten prohibitions risk doing just that. Moreover, 
          many of the provisions are duplicative of each other and thus unnecessary.  
              Prohibitions one, two, three, four, five, and seven prohibit the officials 
          from engaging in, essentially, any action “for the purpose of urging, 
          encouraging, pressuring, or inducing” content moderation. But “urging, 
          encouraging, pressuring” or even “inducing” action does not violate the 
          Constitution unless and until such conduct crosses the line into coercion or 
          significant encouragement. Compare Walker, 576 U.S. at 208 (“[A]s a general 
          matter, when the government speaks it is entitled to promote a program, to 
          espouse a policy, or to take a position.”), Finley, 524 U.S. at 598 (Scalia, J., 
          concurring in judgment) (“It is the very business of government to favor and 
          disfavor points of view . . . .”), and Vullo, 49 F.4th at 717 (holding statements 
          “encouraging” companies to evaluate risk of doing business with the plaintiff 
          did not violate the Constitution where the statements did not “intimate that 
          some form of punishment or adverse regulatory action would follow the 
          failure to accede to the request”), with Blum, 457 U.S. at 1004, and 
                            66 
                Case: 23-30445      Document: 00516889176     Page: 67     Date Filed: 09/08/2023
                                                    No. 23-30445 
                     O’Handley, 62 F.4th at 1158 (“In deciding whether the government may urge 
                     a private party to remove (or refrain from engaging in) protected speech, we 
                     have drawn a sharp distinction between attempts to convince and attempts 
                     to coerce.”). These provisions also tend to overlap with each other, barring 
                     various actions that may cross the line into coercion. There is no need to try 
                     to spell out every activity that the government could possibly engage in that 
                     may run afoul of the Plaintiffs’ First Amendment rights as long the unlawful 
                     conduct is prohibited. 
                            The eighth, ninth, and tenth provisions likewise may be unnecessary 
                     to ensure Plaintiffs’ relief. A government actor generally does not violate the 
                     First Amendment by simply “following up with social-media companies” 
                     about content-moderation, “requesting content reports from social-media 
                     companies” concerning their content-moderation, or asking social media 
                                                                           23
                     companies to “Be on The Lookout” for certain posts.  Plaintiffs have not 
                     carried their burden to show that these activities must be enjoined to afford 
                     Plaintiffs full relief.   
                            These provisions are vague as well. There would be no way for a 
                     federal official to know exactly when his or her actions cross the line from 
                     permissibly communicating with a social-media company to impermissibly 
                     “urging, encouraging, pressuring, or inducing” them “in any way.” See Scott, 
                     826 F.3d at 209, 213 (“[a]n injunction should not contain broad 
                     generalities”);  Islander East, 1998 WL 307564, at *4 (finding injunction 
                     against “interfering in any way” too vague). Nor does the injunction define 
                            _____________________ 
                            23
                              While these activities, standing alone, are not violative of the First Amendment 
                     and therefore must be removed from the preliminary injunction, we note that these 
                     activities  may  violate the First Amendment when they are part of a larger scheme of 
                     government coercion or significant encouragement, and neither our opinion nor the 
                     modified injunction should be read to hold otherwise. 
                                                         67 
        Case: 23-30445      Document: 00516889176     Page: 68     Date Filed: 09/08/2023
                          No. 23-30445 
          “Be on The Lookout” or “BOLO.” That, too, renders it vague. See 
          Louisiana v. Biden, 45 F.4th at 846 (holding injunction prohibiting the federal 
          government from “implementing the Pause of new oil and natural gas leases 
          on public lands or in offshore waters as set forth in [the challenged Executive 
          Order]” was vague because the injunction did not define the term “Pause” 
          and the parties had each proffered different yet reasonable interpretations of 
          the Pause’s breadth). 
              While helpful to some extent, the injunction’s carveouts do not solve 
          its clarity and scope problems. Although they seem to greenlight legal speech, 
          the carveouts, too, include vague terms and appear to authorize activities that 
          the injunction otherwise prohibits on its face. For instance, it is not clear 
          whether the Surgeon General could publicly urge social media companies to 
          ensure that cigarette ads do not target children. While such a statement could 
          meet the injunction’s exception for “exercising permissible public 
          government speech promoting government policy or views on matters of 
          public concern,” it also “urg[es] . . . in any manner[] social-media companies 
          to change their guidelines for removing, deleting, suppressing, or reducing 
          content containing protected speech.” This example illustrates both the 
          injunction’s overbreadth, as such public statements constitute lawful speech, 
          see Walker, 576 U.S. at 208, and vagueness, because the government-speech 
          exception is ill-defined, see Scott, 826 F.3d at 209, 213 (vacating injunction 
          requiring the Louisiana Secretary of State to maintain in force his “policies, 
          procedures, and directives” related to the enforcement of the National Voter 
          Registration Act, where “policies, procedures, and directives” were not 
          defined). At the same time, given the legal framework at play, these carveouts 
          are likely duplicative and, as a result, unnecessary. 
              Finally, the fifth prohibition—which bars the officials from 
          “collaborating, coordinating, partnering, switchboarding, and/or jointly 
          working with the Election Integrity Partnership, the Virality Project, the 
                            68 
        Case: 23-30445      Document: 00516889176     Page: 69     Date Filed: 09/08/2023
                          No. 23-30445 
          Stanford Internet Observatory, or any like project or group” to engage in the 
          same activities the officials are proscribed from doing on their own— may 
          implicate private, third-party actors that are not parties in this case and that 
          may be entitled to their own First Amendment protections. Because the 
          provision fails to identify the specific parties that are subject to the 
          prohibitions, see Scott, 826 F.3d at 209, 213, and “exceeds the scope of the 
          parties’ presentation,” OCA-Greater Houston v. Texas, 867 F.3d 604, 616 
          (5th Cir. 2017), Plaintiffs have not shown that the inclusion of these third 
          parties is necessary to remedy their injury. So, this provision cannot stand at 
          this juncture. See also Alexander v. United States, 509 U.S. 544, 550 (1993) 
          (“[C]ourt orders that actually [] forbid speech activities are classic examples 
          of prior restraints.”). For the same reasons, the injunction’s application to 
          “all acting in concert with [the officials]” is overbroad.  
              We therefore VACATE prohibitions one, two, three, four, five, 
          seven, eight, nine, and ten of the injunction.  
              That leaves provision six, which bars the officials from “threatening, 
          pressuring, or coercing social-media companies in any manner to remove, 
          delete, suppress, or reduce posted content of postings containing protected 
          free speech.” But, those terms could also capture otherwise legal speech. So, 
          the injunction’s language must be further tailored to exclusively target illegal 
          conduct and provide the officials with additional guidance or instruction on 
          what behavior is prohibited. To be sure, our standard practice is to remand 
          to the district court to tailor such a provision in the first instance. See Scott, 
          826 F.3d at 214. But this is far from a standard case. In light of the expedited 
          nature of this appeal, we modify the injunction’s remaining provision 
          ourselves. 
              In doing so, we look to the Seventh Circuit’s approach in 
          Backpage.com, 807 F.3d at 239. There, the Seventh Circuit held that a county 
                            69 
        Case: 23-30445      Document: 00516889176     Page: 70     Date Filed: 09/08/2023
                          No. 23-30445 
          sheriff violated Backpage’s First Amendment rights by demanding that 
          financial service companies cut ties with Backpage in an effort to “crush” the 
          platform (an online forum for “adult” classified ads). Id. at 230. To remedy 
          the constitutional violation, the court issued the following injunction: 
              Sheriff Dart, his office, and all employees, agents, or others 
              who are acting or have acted for or on behalf of him, shall take 
              no actions, formal or informal, to coerce or threaten credit card 
              companies, processors, financial institutions, or other third 
              parties with sanctions intended to ban credit card or other 
              financial services from being provided to Backpage.com. 
          Id. at 239.  
              Like the Seventh Circuit’s preliminary injunction in Backpage.com, we 
          endeavor to modify the preliminary injunction here to target the coercive 
          government behavior with sufficient clarity to provide the officials notice of 
          what activities are proscribed. Specifically, prohibition six of the injunction 
          is MODIFIED to state: 
              Defendants, and their employees and agents, shall take no 
              actions, formal or informal, directly or indirectly, to coerce or 
              significantly encourage social-media companies to remove, 
              delete, suppress, or reduce, including through altering their 
              algorithms, posted social-media content containing protected 
              free speech. That includes, but is not limited to, compelling the 
              platforms to act, such as by intimating that some form of 
              punishment will follow a failure to comply with any request, or 
              supervising, directing, or otherwise meaningfully controlling 
              the social-media companies’ decision-making processes.  
                            70 
        Case: 23-30445      Document: 00516889176     Page: 71     Date Filed: 09/08/2023
                          No. 23-30445 
              Under the modified injunction, the enjoined Defendants cannot 
          coerce or significantly encourage a platform’s content-moderation decisions. 
          Such conduct includes threats of adverse consequences—even if those 
          threats are not verbalized and never materialize—so long as a reasonable 
          person would construe a government’s message as alluding to some form of 
          punishment. That, of course, is informed by context (e.g., persistent 
          pressure, perceived or actual ability to make good on a threat). The 
          government cannot subject the platforms to legal, regulatory, or economic 
          consequences (beyond reputational harms) if they do not comply with a given 
          request. See Bantam Books, 372 U.S. at 68; Okwedy, 333 F.3d at 344. The 
          enjoined Defendants also cannot supervise a platform’s content moderation 
          decisions or directly involve themselves in the decision itself. Social-media 
          platforms’ content-moderation decisions must be theirs and theirs alone. See 
          Blum, 457 U.S. at 1008. This approach captures illicit conduct, regardless of 
          its form. 
              Because the modified injunction does not proscribe Defendants from 
          activities that could include legal conduct, no carveouts are needed. There 
          are two guiding inquiries for Defendants. First, is whether their action could 
          be reasonably interpreted as a threat to take, or cause to be taken, an official 
          action against the social-media companies if the companies decline 
          Defendants’ request to remove, delete, suppress, or reduce protected free 
          speech on their platforms. Second, is whether Defendants have exercised 
          active, meaningful control over the platforms’ content-moderation decisions 
          to such a degree that it inhibits the platforms’ independent decision-making. 
              To be sure, this modified injunction still “restricts government 
          communications not specifically targeted to particular content posted by 
          plaintiffs themselves,” as the officials protest. But that does not mean it is still 
          overbroad. To the contrary, an injunction “is not necessarily made overbroad 
          by extending benefit or protection to persons other than prevailing parties in 
                            71 
        Case: 23-30445      Document: 00516889176     Page: 72     Date Filed: 09/08/2023
                          No. 23-30445 
          the lawsuit—even if it is not a class action—if such breadth is necessary to 
          give prevailing parties the relief to which they are entitled.” Pro. Ass’n of Coll. 
          Educators, TSTA/NEA v. El Paso Cnty. Cmty. Coll. Dist., 730 F.2d 258, 274 
          (5th Cir. 1984) (citations omitted); see also Bresgal v. Brock, 843 F.2d 1163, 
          1170–71 (9th Cir. 1987). Such breadth is plainly necessary, if not inevitable, 
          here. The officials have engaged in a broad pressure campaign designed to 
          coerce social-media companies into suppressing speakers, viewpoints, and 
          content disfavored by the government. The harms that radiate from such 
          conduct extend far beyond just the Plaintiffs; it impacts every social-media 
          user. Naturally, then, an injunction against such conduct will afford 
          protections that extend beyond just Plaintiffs, too. Cf. Feds for Med. Freedom 
          v. Biden, 63 F.4th 366, 387 (5th Cir. 2023) (“[A]n injunction [can] benefit 
          non-parties as long as that benefit [is] merely incidental.” (internal quotation 
          marks and citation omitted)).  
              As explained in Part IV above, the district court erred in finding that 
          the NIAID Officials, CISA Officials, and State Department Officials likely 
          violated Plaintiffs’ First Amendment rights. So, we exclude those parties 
          from the injunction. Accordingly, the term “Defendants” as used in this 
          modified provision is defined to mean only the following entities and officials 
          included in the original injunction:  
              The following members of the Executive Office of the 
              President of the United States: White House Press Secretary, 
              Karine Jean-Pierre; Counsel to the President, Stuart F. Delery;

              The district court’s judgment is AFFIRMED with respect to the
