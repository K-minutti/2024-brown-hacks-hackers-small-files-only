                                    University Affairs Committee – October 5, 2021 
                     Critical Race Theory – Proposed Resolution and Statement of Information 
               RESOLUTION: 
               The Board of Regents affirms its commitment to academic freedom in the Laws of the Regents 
               as encompassing the <the freedom to inquire, discover, access, publish, disseminate, and teach 
               truth as the individual understands it, subject to no control or authority save the control and 
                                                                                                 1
               authority of the rational methods by which knowledge is established in the field.=  
               The Board of Regents affirms its commitment to the principle that <faculty members shall not 
               be subjected to direct or indirect pressures in an attempt to influence their work in a manner 
               that would conflict with professional standards in the field. The Board of Regents and 
               administration shall not impose such pressures or influence and shall resist such pressures or 
               interference when exerted from outside the university.=2 
               The Board of Regents recognizes that critical race theory is a recognized and legitimate field of 
               academic inquiry and discourse. 
               The Board of Regents denounces any efforts to preclude or limit the teaching of critical race 
               theory at the University of Colorado or at other institutions of higher education. Any such 
               efforts are contrary to the principle that <all faculty members, within the scope of their faculty 
               responsibilities, must have freedom to study, learn, and conduct scholarship and create work 
               within their discipline, and to communicate the result of these pursuits to others, bound only 
               by the control and authority of the rational methods by which knowledge is established in the 
                     3
               field.=  
               The Board of Regents recognizes that members of the university community and the public may 
               disagree with the tenets of critical race theory, and the Board of Regents, fully respects their 
               right to disagree and challenge those tenets. The Board of Regents is committed to the principle 
               that the <best method for advancing the state of knowledge is engaging with the broadest 
               range of theories, methodologies, data, and conflicting opinions,= rather than attempting in any 
               way to preclude or limit the teaching of any academic theory.4 
               The Board of Regents supports training to advance diversity, equity and inclusion on University 
               of Colorado campuses

               The Board of Regents determines that it would be inappropriate it to attempt to limit or define 
               the content of any such training, other than to observe that the training should be consistent 
               with Regent Policy 1.B., which states that the university will <ensure policies, programs, 
               procedures, and practices promote a continuing commitment to building a community of 
               faculty, students, and staff in which diversity is a fundamental value. Such policies, programs 
               and procedures will also serve to ensure the rich interchange of ideas in the pursuit of truth and 
               learning, including diversity of political, geographic, cultural, intellectual, and philosophical 
                              5
               perspectives.=  
               STATEMENT OF INFORMATION: 
               Critical race theory is an academic theory that has its origins in the 1970s and 1980s with legal 
               scholars including Derrick Bell, Alan Freemen, and Richard Delgado. These scholars and others 
               posited that racism is an enduring part of American society and that existing legal structures 
               often exist to promote the majority9s self-interest.6  
               In the field of education, there are five major tenets of CRT that scholars advocate should 
               inform theory, research, pedagogy, curriculum and policy: (1) the intercentricity of race and 
               racism; (2) the challenge to dominant ideology; (3) the commitment to social justice; (4) the 
               centrality of experiential knowledge; and (5) the utilization of interdisciplinary approaches. 
                      The intercentricity of race and racism with other forms of subordination. CRT starts 
                       from the premise that race and racism are central, endemic, permanent and a 
                       fundamental part of defining and explaining how US society functions . . .  
                 
                      The challenge to dominant ideology. CRT challenges White privilege and refutes 
                       the claims that educational institutions make toward objectivity, meritocracy, 
                       color‐blindness, race neutrality and equal opportunity. CRT challenges notions of 
                       8neutral9 research or 8objective9 researchers and exposes deficit‐informed research 
                       that silences, ignores and distorts epistemologies of People of Color . . . 
                        
                        
                      The commitment to social justice. CRT is committed to social justice and offers a 
                       liberatory or transformative response to racial, gender and class oppression . . .

                         The centrality of experiential knowledge. CRT recognizes that the experiential 
                          knowledge of People of Color is legitimate, appropriate, and critical to 
                          understanding, analyzing and teaching about racial subordination CRT draws 
                          explicitly on the lived experiences of People of Color by including such methods as 
                          storytelling, family histories, biographies, scenarios, parables, cuentos, 
                          testimonios, chronicles and narratives . . .  
                           
                           
                         The transdisciplinary perspective. CRT goes beyond disciplinary boundaries to 
                          analyze race and racism within both historical and contemporary contexts, 
                          drawing on scholarship from ethnic studies, women9s studies, sociology, history, 
                                                                             7
                          law, psychology, film, theatre and other fields.   
                 These five themes are not new in and of themselves, but collectively they represent a challenge 
                 to the existing modes of scholarship.8 
                 Critical race theory often critiques traditional liberal ideology, which has attempted to divest 
                 race categories of social significance and treat all persons equally. Critical race theorists have 
                 argued that traditional liberal ideology perpetuates privilege and fails to recognize inherent 
                 racism in systems.9 More recently, scholars have advocated that systems must be reformed to 
                 be consciously <antiracist= because in the absence of making antiracist choices, those systems 
                 unconsciously uphold aspects of white supremacy, white-dominant culture, and unequal 
                              10
                 institutions.   
                 Critical race theory is not universally accepted. To the contrary, there are those who sincerely 
                 disagree with the tenets of critical race theory and its core teaching that systemic racism 
                 pervades American society.11 In the past year, legislation was introduced or passed in at least 
                 sixteen states that attempts to limit the teaching of concepts that proponents of the legislation

               associated with critical race theory. For example, in the State of Texas, newly effective 
               legislation states that a K-12 school district may not <make a part of a course the concept that . 
               . .meritocracy or traits such as a hard work ethic are racist . . . [or] that <slavery and racism are 
               anything other than deviations from, betrayals of, or failures to live up to, the authentic 
               founding principles of the United States, which include liberty and equality.=12 In Idaho, 
               legislation applicable to public institutions of higher education found that teaching critical race 
               concepts <exacerbate and inflame divisions on the basis of sex, race, ethnicity, religion, color, 
               national origin, or other criteria in ways contrary to the nation. . .=13 
               No such legislation has been introduced or passed in Colorado, but institutions of higher 
               education and scholars within them have been criticized for teaching concepts associated with 
               critical race theory, including at the University of Colorado.14, 15 Before it was rescinded,16 the 
               former president issued an executive order prohibiting workplace training on <divisive 
                          17
               concepts,=  including concepts mistakenly associated with critical race theory, leading some 
               universities to postpone training intended to promote diversity, equity and inclusion.18 In 
               response to this order, several institutions of higher education filed amicus briefs asserting that 
               the order unconstitutionally infringed upon the concept of academic freedom and freedom of 
               expression as recognized in the United States Supreme Court9s precedent.19 
               Research has established that organizations that respect and promote diversity are more 
                                                                                        20
               successful and produce better outcomes than non-diverse organizations.  Recognizing the 
               value of increased diversity in higher education, the Office of Planning, Evaluation and Policy 
               Development in the United States Department of Education has recommended that institutions 
               of higher education <develop and facilitate programming to increase the cultural competency 
               of leadership, faculty, staff, and students= and has noted that <diversity training and workshops
