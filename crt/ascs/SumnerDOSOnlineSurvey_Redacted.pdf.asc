                       keep politics out of our classrooms. Educating our students should be priority. We have a
                       couple new Board members who are highly misinformed. They have an agenda and seem to
                       want to make decisions based on their political beliefs and not based on laws. Let’s please
                       listen to educators and staff members who have experience in the classroom. I would like to
                       try and keep politics out of educating children.

                       to think outside the box and use that creativity to engage in their community. Our educators
                       need to be fully vetted and made aware of their sole responsibility, and that is to educate our
                       children and support them in their studies… that is it! For those educators to be effective in
                       their resources to shape and mold our children, they need to be paid their worth, and frankly, it
                       is laughable to see what we think of our teachers

          211            As far as I have witnessed, the best thing I see in Sumner County is the small neighborhood            12/15/2022 9:36 AM
                         school. Oakmont, North Sumner and Bethpage, etc. The larger the school, the worse the
                         situation.
          212            High test scores, long tenured of teachers, active PTO in most schools, successful sports              12/15/2022 9:01 AM
                         programs, high graduation rate, active parent involvement
          213            Extracurricular activities like robotics and 4H and other sports                                       12/15/2022 8:58 AM
          214            Sumner county schools at this moment are NOT very impressive                                           12/15/2022 8:30 AM
          215            Dr. Phillips will be greatly missed. He has invested in not only the students of Sumner County,        12/15/2022 8:30 AM
                         but also ALL employees. This needs to be continued. We are facing such a challenge with
                         hiring quality teachers and support staff, we must continue to value our people.
          216            Excellent teachers. Great academic offerings including strong AP and CTE programs.                     12/15/2022 7:51 AM

          219            The success of a school system that sees value in everything that it oversees. Ex: classroom           12/15/2022 6:15 AM
                         instruction, extra curricular activities,,school facilities. The value of teachers. The importance
                         of being successful in the classroom and the willingness to do what’s right over what is
                         popular.
          220            I like the fact that the school board has decided to not ban books because of racist or                12/15/2022 6:06 AM
                         homophobic parents.
          221            SCS has always had a good reputation but I’m hearing the test scores are declining.                    12/15/2022 3:28 AM

          226            Most teachers appear to be high quality educators that care about the students succeeding.             12/14/2022 7:47 PM

                        see a good change in Sumner County Schools.

                       not just with instruction, but also to help students with outside struggles the student may be
                       facing. Continued support of programs such as STARS and other mental health services is an
                       excellent way to continue to support our classroom teachers. The teachers cannot teach and
                       counsel, but we can identify when a student may need additional services. Having somewhere
                       to suggest that they go for additional support is a blessing and brings peace of mind in the
                       current climate we teach in (i.e. mass school shootings). It is scary to see a child struggling
                       with their mental health, and hope that that they don't have access to a firearm. Ensuring that
                       there is a team at every school that teachers can alert when there is a concern for a student is
                       an important resource that I hope is at every school (and if it is not, should be implemented).

                        students and the lack of programs they provide for the students. They only focus on the
                        students passing the ACT, their EOC’s, and sending them to the military. There is no focus on
                        teaching trades, encouraging growth, building relationships or confidence. This district is dying

                        together with policy and practices. I feel like the school can do better at the discipline actions

         839           there are some great teachers and teaching methods. Also really like the abundance of clubs      12/9/2022 4:14 PM
                       and groups for kids to join.
         840           Good transparency and communication with the parents regarding all things relative to our        12/9/2022 4:14 PM
                       children and their education.
         841           I think we have some great teachers and schools but as far as what this director has done, he    12/9/2022 4:12 PM
                       does not listen, does not relate to teachers, does not even live in our area and he has never
                       had kids in our school system. He opens up a new school and spend tons of money on it when
                       there were other school that needed work and we needed a new school out Dobyns Pike, not
                       where he put it.

                       yearly. Putting students and their education first.
         844           Sense of community. Protection of kids from political agendas and trends. There is enough        12/9/2022 4:06 PM
                       cultural influence around them already. School leaders should educate, protect, and encourage
                       our children without imparting biased ideologies on them.
         845           We have a great curriculum and leaders at the elementary level. We are in a good place with      12/9/2022 4:04 PM
                       ELA and Math programs. The behavior programs with Ron Clark's houses builds positive
                       community in the schools. Our Guidance program is strong! The teacher leaders are effective
                       and a great place to build understanding and ask questions. SROs give a great deal of support
                       and peace within the buildings.
         846           Salaries are improving. Need to catch up and even surpass surrounding counties.                  12/9/2022 4:03 PM

         850           I think the schools I have experience with, the principals have kept us parents well informed.   12/9/2022 3:58 PM

                        for feedback. Communicating how this feedback is used is so important. We need to see that

                        designed.

                        classroom have a set of computers for student use. It is impossible to use technology
                        efficiently when teachers are fighting for lab time and computer time, especially during EOC

                        County Schools are largely in good shape. Dr. Phillips and current leadership have, for the
                        most part, allowed common sense and practical thought guide the school system for the past
                        11 years. Sumner County Schools are recognized by the Tennessee Department of Education
                        as being innovative and proactive in meeting the needs of its various stakeholders.
                        Furthermore, a significant part of the driving force of unprecedented growth in the county is the
                        attractiveness of the school system to those seeking to move to a new area.
         1129           The schools have a strong relationship with the communities in general. The communities and          12/9/2022 11:25 AM
                        businesses within seem to really rally behind the schools. So that relationship is something
                        that HAS to be upheld and continue to grow.

                        director pride has played a part in many decisions and in turn our students were the ones that
                        suffered. Such as the double rezoning that happened several years ago. Saving money was
                        more important than planning ahead to prevent them from being shuffled around.

         1175           So far, Sumner has avoided becoming the ridiculous national spectacle that Williamson and            12/9/2022 11:08 AM
                        other counties have been during board meetings and in handling current controversies. I am
                        so, so glad for that, but I also know that many groups like Moms for Liberty are working very
                        hard to bring their loud, divisive approach to Sumner as well. I think it's extremely important we
                        remain focused on our students' and teachers' needs, not the wedge issues of an angry fringe.

         1192           Our Title 1 and CDC programs are amazing. The ESL accommodations are also great. The              12/9/2022 11:05 AM

                        following: programs that are offered that support students wanting to enter a trade school after

                         schooling of their children. I want to see a strong force to stand up against book bans,

          1310           Sumner County is great! The SPED department needs to continue. I love the idea of teacher                12/9/2022 10:36 AM
                         leaders and the supports that are available.
          1311           We have great kids and teachers!! We need to focus on valuing the awesome people we                      12/9/2022 10:36 AM
                         have....not with special appreciation days but by trusting them to be the professionals that
                         they are!
          1312           Growing technical education programs. Excellence in academics. Caring and knowledgeable                  12/9/2022 10:36 AM
                         teachers and staff who have genuine love and care for the students. Increased school capacity
                         to meet demands of growing population.
          1313           The additions of Wit and Wisdom so that students can have a similar curriculum between                   12/9/2022 10:36 AM
                         schools. More of a presence of Central office staff in the schools- it helps so that there isn't as
                         much of a divide where they are there to help.
          1314           Sumner County has strong teachers and leaders. The academics, atheletic programs, fine arts              12/9/2022 10:36 AM
                         programs, CTE programs, EL, SPED, and most of the special schools are needed to meet the
                         needs of all students. The building program (which may have gone a bit extravegant) is also
                         needed to ensure that the school system can keep up with the growth in the county.

          1319           I listened to this week's school board meeting and I was embarrassed of the current board that           12/9/2022 10:35 AM
                         represents Sumner County Schools.

         1327          Sumner County has a long history of providing a considerable number of programs for students    12/9/2022 10:33 AM

         1328          I am just starting with them so we will see.                                                    12/9/2022 10:33 AM

         1331          I think our schools have gone down since Del Phillips entered our county. He shouldn’t even be  12/9/2022 10:32 AM
                       receiving a pay check. Once you retire or resign then you are done and need to leave.
         1332          Too many to list. I love my child's middle school and loved her elementary school. Both are     12/9/2022 10:32 AM
                       excellent.
         1333          The learning, leadership and curriculum along with the fact that dollars are being spent on     12/9/2022 10:32 AM

         1335          The STEM program is amazing. It does need a bit more help for our school in my opinion. I       12/9/2022 10:32 AM
                       love hearing my child talk about the fun events, what she learned with her classmates, and
                       family nights thats STEM related at the schools are a great way to keep the community and
                       children active in learning and have quality time.

         1340          I'm satisfied with the current process.                                                         12/9/2022 10:30 AM
         1341          I feel like communication amongst everyone (teachers, parents, leaders, etc) is very strong.    12/9/2022 10:30 AM
                       This is so important so that everyone is on the same page. I would like to see this continued.

         1351          We have a strong core of employees who are invested in the success of our students and          12/9/2022 10:29 AM
                       school system. Sumner County, depsite its size, feels like a very close and tight knit family. I
                       feel comfortable reaching out to anyone from my principal to Dr. Phillips. It is not like that in all
                       school systems. We've seen vital pay raises for teachers and staff the last couple of years,
                       which has helped.

          1354          I honestly can't name a single thing that stands out right now                                        12/9/2022 10:28 AM
          1355          Increasing opportunities for students to gain early post secondary certification and credits.         12/9/2022 10:27 AM
          1356          more emphasis on schools less central staff, shortage of class room teachers and we have              12/9/2022 10:27 AM
                        1000 central office employees
          1357          Continue to increase teacher pay, especially those with master's or higher to encourage               12/9/2022 10:27 AM
                        education. I would like to see less emphasis on testing. Colleges are even going away from
                        higher stakes testing, so maybe decrease the impact ONE test will have on a student's grade.
                        Increase supports for those in special education services.
          1358          I cannot say what I are that works well, but teachers need to be supported, students and              12/9/2022 10:27 AM
                        teachers need to feel safe, and they need to be actually listened to and respected.
          1359          I enjoy the leadership program they are doing with the children in 5th grade as far as anything       12/9/2022 10:27 AM
                        else I wouldn’t know as our kids don’t bring things home like years ago.

          1364          I've noticed a big improvement with standard curriculum across the schools from the reading           12/9/2022 10:26 AM
                        curriculum to the handwriting curriculum. It helps to have a good network of teachers to
                        discuss, problem solve, and collaborate when there are consistent standard curriculum that all
                        schools are implementing.
          1365          in the last few years there as been more communication via social media that helps to keep us         12/9/2022 10:26 AM

          1372          I think the raises the classified staff are given is a good moral booster. Classified staff often     12/9/2022 10:24 AM
                        feel overlooked. These need to continue.
          1373          I think we are adapting well to the increased number of students we are facing. We have good          12/9/2022 10:24 AM
                        facilities, some much better than others. For the most part, I feel that the Central Office is
                        competent and doing a good job. I feel very supported by my principals and staff I work with. I
                        feel that the Director of Schools supports us very well, and I definitely want that to continue.
                        Dr. Phillips has a common sense approach that needs to continue.

          1387          I feel we have a very strong school district. I have concerns we are growing so fast we will          12/9/2022 10:22 AM
                        lose our strength. My oldest daughter is performing in exceptionally well in college thanks to
                        the strong educational background she got from sumner county schools and my youngest is
                        now a junior and I look forward to great things from her as well.
          1388          Excellent scores in schools like TW Hunter.                                                           12/9/2022 10:22 AM
          1389          We are in the best financial shape we have been in since I joined Sumner County Schools in            12/9/2022 10:22 AM
                        2001 (Over 20 years ago). We don't need to slip and go backwards here. The addition of Lead
                        Educators and Teacher Leaders in our buildings has been essential to the overall success of
                        the schools. Our benefits package and salary are very competitive, but it still needs to be
                        better.
          1390          Not sure about anything good going on County wide. We’ve been lucky to start at LCHS this             12/9/2022 10:22 AM
                        year so having a new facility has been great. Not all families were lucky enough to attend
                        these schools.
          1391          I love that I feel supported in CTE. CTE is important and I would like to continue to feel valued.    12/9/2022 10:22 AM
                        I also feel that we are paid well considering I drive an hour from a neighboring county just to
                        work in Sumner County. I love it here!
          1392          I believe Sumner County has strong instructional leadership within the majority of its schools        12/9/2022 10:22 AM
                        and I would love to see the excellent academic record continue.
          1393          School administrators are provided support from the Director of Schools to manage and lead            12/9/2022 10:22 AM
                        our buildings with appropriate support, accountability, and autonomy when there is a proven
                        track record of success. The current leadership does not frequently change school building
                        leaders, but believes in ensuring consistency for communities.

                        we appear to be well ahead of california academically. Please keep this going.

                        markets. Office staff makes less than bus drivers at this time. These people are the ones who
                        face parents, execute attendance contracts, and fill many unlisted roles each day.

                        recently that teachers are in need of a salary comparable to other surrounding counties, i.e

         1465           As I'm a teacher at GHS, that is what I'm going to speak on. We are probably one of the most       12/9/2022 10:15 AM
                        diverse schools in the county. Despite the fact that we have an old school that needs a lot of

                        high school experience)
         1474           I would like to see Sumner County continue progressing each year, academically and                 12/9/2022 10:14 AM
                        technically, as we have been under the direction of Dr. Phillips.

         1476           I loved that teacher pay has been a subject for the board. Teachers are still underpaid so this    12/9/2022 10:13 AM

         1479           Increased access to technology, implementing STEM based activities, opportunities for a            12/9/2022 10:13 AM

         1481           Building level principal autonomy is a strength in this county. Previously, I worked in a system   12/9/2022 10:13 AM
                        that expected each school to function one prescribed way, which did not address the diverse
                        needs of each student population.
         1482           I appreciate the many resources provided for students when it comes to receiving additional        12/9/2022 10:13 AM
                        help, but I wish teachers could receive the same effort in support.
         1483           Long term thinking with building the new schools and expanding others to get rid of the            12/9/2022 10:13 AM
                        portables. It’s great to see so many reward schools and students winning awards and
                        recognitions. I believe sumner county schools are going in the right direction and I’d like that to
                        continue.
         1484           pay increases                                                                                      12/9/2022 10:12 AM
         1485           I think the continued growth in CTE Programs is impeccable. A Director of Schools who              12/9/2022 10:12 AM
                        understands that there are more opportunities after high school than a four-year college
                        program is important to me.

                         technology for the kids. Sumner county has also failed by not providing more magnet schools
                         or gifted programs.
          1496           I feel supported as a professional. The new director should continue to support teachers and          12/9/2022 10:11 AM
                         principals, and support policies that is best for the education of all children.

                        that may no longer be effective in the classroom but majority ARE strong leaders, mentors,
                        educators, etc etc etc. Teachers need someone to stand up for them. Would be great if they
                        had a lot of background in curriculum and classroom experiences. Someone that knows what
                        teachers are REALLY dealing with not what parents are making up.

                        they can. Further, there are ongoing challenges about books and curriculum. The director will
                        have to have thick skin and do what’s best for the school system. They will have to tune out
                        and not bend to political pressure. Staffing will likely continue to be a challenge. Teachers
                        should be free to express their opinions without fear of repercussions.

                        schools and our district need a clear policy regarding book challenges, with an emphasis on
                        the challenger having children in our district, and an emphasis on the challenger reading the
                        entire text that is being challenged and not just the portions with which they disagree. Our
                        director needs to ensure that students are given an accurate accounting of history, the only
                        way we can avoid the mistakes of the past is to learn about them and learn from them. Finally,
                        our new Director needs to ensure that students are taught how to interpret information: whether
                        or not it comes from a valid source, and whether or not the information is accurate. Our
                        students need to leave us being able to think critically.

                         like slavery, racism, sexism, and homophobia. Some parents and political groups want to take
                         the power of decision-making away from principals, teachers, and librarians, when those are
                         precisely the people for the job.
          161            A large portion of the community does not trust SCBOE's priorities and feel that it is in               12/15/2022 2:35 PM
                         contrast with the values Sumner County families hold. There is numerous positions open
                         across the county a real solution needs to be put in place to meet students' needs in a
                         meaningful way. The Special Education Department needs to provide additional supports to the
                         special education teachers to understand the law, ongoing PLC work, retention of teachers,
                         consistency in decisions being made for students no matter their home school, etc.
          162            Apathy has become a major problem in our schools which I believe is directly related to the             12/15/2022 2:35 PM
                         pandemic. I think one way to improve this is to improve our discipline system. Accountability
                         is also a major problems and the parents do not help this. I think there needs to be firm
                         policies across the county for student accountability. I also think teacher retention is going to
                         become a problem. Many of us feel underpaid, unsupported, and unappreciated by the county,
                         parents, state, and community.

                         viewpoints. They will need to be effective at communicating to unite staff, teachers,

                         is good or bad. The director will also have to face relationships between the school system and

                        working with the students! There is also a rise in behavior problems! Conscious discipline is
                        not the answer for every student. Teachers are not supported with this at all! Classmates are
                        at a learning loss because the severe behaviors are not addressed.

          181           We as a county are behind in a lot of areas. There is also a huge discrepancy of where the           12/15/2022 2:03 PM
                        funds go to support certain schools, while other schools are clearly and purposely not included
                        in funding that is desperately needed. The new director needs to find a better balance. Also we
                        are still very behind in equal pay compared to the counties surrounding us and we will continue
                        to lose good educators for this reason.

                        raises are brought to the the Board, the raises are always smaller than the Certified
                        employees. It devalues the employees and in this time they can earn more else where. Some
                        full time employees make as low as $14,000 a year. That is very shameful for Sumner Co.

                        also concerned the admin offices are very separate from the schools and boots on the ground.
                        The dress codes need to be evaluated to allow holes in jeans as long as they are below where
                        shorts/skirts are required for girls. I see lots of wasted education time on a small knee tear.
         216            Many parents perceive a subtle resentment from administrators if they "get outside of their       12/15/2022 12:04 PM
                        box." A lack of transparency and the genereal dismissal of calls for information breeds distrust
                        and a questioning of the motives of leadership. Currently, some administrators (or their
                        friends/spouses) frequently publish facebook posts that deride parents for questioning policies
                        and declare that parents should leave decision making "to the experts." An educator with
                        integrity values parents concerns and input even if it different from their own, and if makes
                        their job more difficult. Many teachers feel enormous pressure for test scores at the expense
                        of quality teaching and long term learning.

                        families in Sumner County. The school board does not seem to listen to parents and has no
                        interest in outside opinions. Del Phiillips has created an environment that lacks trust of the
                        administration and how parents view the current administration. The new Director will have to
                        revive trust with the families and with how parents view the organization that makes
                        educational decisions for our children. Parent involvement should be of regular inclusion and
                        not dismissed. Additionally, during COVID, many decisions were made that have negatively
                        affected students academically, that could have been prevented. This will be another hurdle to
                        overcome for the new Director of Schools. Proper communication with parents is so necessary
                        and this will be something that needs to be revisited within Sumner County Schools.

         257            The new Director of Schools will need to work as hard as they can to build trust. Sumner            12/14/2022 3:14 PM
                        County is a divisive political arena. Thankfully, there seems to be better parental awareness in
                        regard to parental/educator input and involvement with curriculum, instruction, and leadership.
                        The new director will need to be principled in their decision-making and be a listener of the
                        parents, teachers, administrators, and students. I believe the new Director must have a
                        student-focused mindset. I would like someone who will stand in the gap against agendas
                        outside of what is needed for education. I am typing this on my phone, so my thoughts may be
                        a little scattered. Obscene material—ad determining what that means from household to
                        household, pandemics and mandates and determining what is overreaching and what is not
                        enough, tenured teachers who are tired or unwilling to try new things, overwhelmed new
                        teachers, administrators who are over understaffed buildings, schools that get too much favor
                        and schools that are forgotten, the argumentative political landscape of our county—all sides
                        are guilty of this, there are so many challenges.

                          Westmorland, for example. Holding each school to high standards while understanding the
                          different paths each may need to take to get there is essential.

         383            A new group of school board members along with a new county commission could provide               12/13/2022 7:09 AM

                        interpersonal skills. I’m worried if he isn’t removed he will scare off excellent candidates willing

                       what their children are learning outside of the traditional studies. We have to remain involved

                        news has given parents and others in community the absurd idea that educators are trying to
                        pollute students' minds! And our state legislators are letting them get away with it. ON a local
                        level, I think that the school cafeterias should have more personnel and be able to serve better
                        food. The director and other top personnel should eat at a school cafeteria at least once a
                        week.

                        all others behind. Facilities at all schools had to be financed by groups in each community and
                        LC was given the best of the best.

          480           I don’t feel that SCS are prepared for another pandemic. We have many areas that do not have         12/12/2022 12:52 PM
                        access to cellular & internet services. I don’t think Covid was a one time issue. It will happen
                        again & if these services aren’t made available, students will have another educational gap to
                        makeup. Also, some members of the current board are beholden to political interest groups
                        that do not have the best intentions of ALL SCS students & staff. They will fight anyone that is
                        not white, Christian & republican. Good Luck.

          485           Culturally, Sumner county is still largely conservative. We need to be very mindful that the loud    12/12/2022 12:16 PM
                        minority (not related to ethnicity but numbers) cannot and should not be able to dictate policy
                        to a largely conservative majority. CRT and common core should not have a place in
                        Tennessee.
          486           Some of the newly elected board members appear very hard to work with. They are extremists           12/12/2022 12:09 PM
                        and are putting their personal political beliefs on the forefront. As a citizen of Sumner County, I
                        believe they are taking us back ten years. I feel sorry for any reasonable, intelligent person
                        who has to work with them. I hope the general public will wise up and vote them out, so we can
                        continue making the progress we were making.

                       like they did in the 90s, etc. All staff need to be trained in cultural bias training and more

                         schools. This is only going to increase as we see more people move into our county. I also
                         feel that many children never caught up from the virtual year (2020), teachers over-worked
          525            Over crowding and the deteriorating buildings at Gallatin High and Howard Elementary Schools          12/12/2022 10:35 AM
          526            Gender ideology being forced on students by teachers and fellow classmates.                           12/12/2022 10:35 AM
          527            Dealing with a staffing shortage. Dealing with staff needing salary increases to help inflationary    12/12/2022 10:34 AM
                         issues. Dealing with aging schools needing improvements and repair. Especially to catch up to
                         Liberty Creek schools and facilities.
          528            Hiring Teachers who actually care about the kids and want to teach them properly. I feel the          12/12/2022 10:23 AM
                         kids are failing because of the teachers not taking the right amount of time to work with the
                         kids. The kids are rushed to learn and not all kids can learn or understand as quickly.
          529            Being able to get along with the commission and school board, fiscal responsibility with              12/12/2022 10:19 AM
                         taxpayer dollars and out of control growth in the county.

                         being over budget and behind schedule.
          532            Budget, teacher pay, limited resources, limited number of available academic courses                  12/12/2022 10:10 AM
          533            Staff being stuck in their ways and far to strict toward students                                     12/12/2022 10:07 AM

          536            Teacher moral is a struggle on all levels and it is a direct result of student behavior. You can be   12/12/2022 10:06 AM
                         the greatest teacher but if there are not adequate consequences to deter poor behavior and
                         blatant disrespect then there's only so much you can do. If this is not fixed, teachers (great
                         ones at that) will continue to leave the profession. It MUST be addressed on all levels. I think
                         there is also a mistrust in the position in general. We have money to spend on brand new top
                         notch facilities for some schools/areas while others are denied simple repairs and much
                         needed upgrades because "we don't have the money."

          552            I believe we need a better division of finances for each school.                                       12/12/2022 9:39 AM

                         to real education!
          554            The current board and Governor.                                                                        12/12/2022 9:22 AM
          555            You will have an upcoming, multi-year cycle of staff shortage due to the current stress you            12/12/2022 9:20 AM
                         chose to put your staff under: high student ratio and low pay. Technology (Ex.- faculty desktop
                         computers) will need to be upgraded to allow for work to be completed efficiently.
          556            I feel like the new Director of Schools will face many challenges that involve things that are or      12/12/2022 9:15 AM
                         are not appropriate for school such as books, dress codes, curriculum. I feel that our country
                         is and was based on a Biblical foundation, "In God We Trust." I feel it would be of the best
                         interest for the whole county to have a Christian person as the Director of Schools. I think that
                         should be the number one criteria. Another challenge will be dealing with parents. The new
                         Director should be able to work and deal with parents without giving into parents who stir up a
                         stink.
          557            Too much money spent on silly things like keeping Dr. Phillips on as a consultant                      12/12/2022 9:12 AM
          558            Pressure to conform with progressive ideologies.                                                       12/12/2022 9:11 AM

                         leaders. The Director should not lead by lead by directives only, but also by the concerns of
                         many individuals who are involved in the education process of our youth.
          561            Lack of progressive SEL programs and supports. There is very little in place to support                12/12/2022 9:05 AM
                         students after the pandemic. Still trying to figure out what ESSR funds were used to support??
          562            A new county commission, poorly informed citizens                                                      12/12/2022 9:03 AM
          563            Trying to please everyone will definitely be a challenge, but I hope the new director will be a        12/12/2022 9:01 AM
                         sincere person who wants to benefit the children and families of this community.

                         families that are important to them. A new director needs to talk with the teachers and let them
                         know they are valued. In person meetings go along way to understand others struggles.
                         director needs to realize this needs to be addressed to retain teachers.

                         without much research or education done to view issues from a different perspective. The ones
                         that are most narrow minded view tend to be the loudest and spread their interpretation of why
                         things are happening without filling understanding the issue or the reasoning behind decisions.
                         A new director will face intense vocal scrutiny when making a decision that is not <how it’s
                         always been done=. The director needs to be able to be proactive and anticipate what both
                         sides of arguments for a policy or change will be and needs to be prepared to provide factual
                         history on what the policy is, why it’s important, why it isn’t as simple as people think it should
                         be. Providing basic education to the community on what summer county can do vs can’t will
                         be very important.

         605            A crazy county commission and a few new, crazy school board members who are trying to               12/11/2022 7:37 PM
                        destroy SCS.
         606            I think with a few new county commissioners could could make it hard for the director. All of       12/11/2022 7:23 PM

         614            A lot of educators are disappointed with our school system and it’s lack of respect for             12/11/2022 5:47 PM
                        teachers. They are seeking people to fill our positions as we leave this profession. Why aren’t

                        underrepresented or ignored or unimportant. The new Director should make sure all students
                        and schools have the same resources and options.

                        portables than build modern, new campuses, like Liberty Creek. Another school site is almost
                        imperative in Castalian springs/Bethpage. The current commission will not be a supporter of
                        anything that benefits the school system. I think the mew school board is also full of Alt-Right,
                        ultra conservative, zero spending members. The new director is almost set up for failure due to
                        the low voter turn out in the recent election.

                         lacking.

          782            These crazy people who don’t have kids in the schools and want to destroy the schools out of          12/10/2022 1:26 AM
                         hate and greed. And these people will pave the way for charter schools, which will increase out
                         mr taxes while hindering the ability to provide quality education. One thing I’d like new director
                         to consider is school starting times. With JPII having a middle school now, I think people are
                         more likely to leave after elementary school. The middle school start times just seem so early.
                         It may also contribute to the lower test scores in middle school.

         833            Challenges that will face the new Director will be how to maintain the level of success of these     12/9/2022 7:34 PM
                        programs within the current operating budget. Another challenge is with lack of technology
                        within our classrooms. There is a great need at every grade level to have more and better
                        access to various technology to aid in their classroom environments. I have students at a local
                        high school who are asked on a daily basis to use their cell phones to participate in classroom
                        learning. This is a challenge to those families who might not be able to afford for their kids to
                        have a cell phone with data options. Having the appropriate technology for all schools, for all
                        grades, and for access for all students would help to make sure that all students are given the
                        same access to success. Also, a challenge that would be faced is within our school libraries.
                        Our libraries do not get the funding that is needed to keep up with the ever-changing
                        technologies that would add to the students out of the classroom education. Libraries need
                        more resources for the students to have access to for example: more computers/devices,
                        more books, more interactive programs to engage students to spend more time within the
                        library to gain and expand their knowledge and love of learning .

                        problem for anyone who is in this position. Administrators that have been placed in schools
                        and the infinite number of created roles at Central Office has created a negative feeling among
                        teachers and families within our county. Teachers are unhappy and leaving in droves
                        throughout the school year. This has a negative impact on students’ learning, especially if a
                        teacher leaves mid year.

                        teachers. Our kids are our future! Dont take this lightly! I have also been greatly disappointed

          916            The school board and the county commissioners, they do not always want what is best for our           12/9/2022 4:20 PM

          920            Stopping the force-fed curriculum and one way ideology of diversity and stop the promotion of         12/9/2022 4:14 PM
                         normalizing perversion in our children's schools. Recognizing and stopping anything in line with
                         critical race theory or wit and wisdom, things like this are counter productive to a child’s
                         education and ability to learn and develop a learning style that promotes the ability to think for
                         themselves and problem solve.

                         board. We really need someone who takes in to consideration the needs of the teachers and
                         students.
          922            Values of Tennesseans, Sumner County parents, want to keep our core values and morals.                     12/9/2022 4:10 PM

                         in need of repairs, additions, and updates.
          925            If the director feels like making decisions to bring political affairs into the classroom, likely a        12/9/2022 4:06 PM
                         mass exodus from the public school system by the surrounding communities.
          926            Something needs to be done about the elementary school level behavior classes. They are                    12/9/2022 4:04 PM
                         being run by substitutes and unqualified persons. It is disruptive and unsafe to have these
                         within the buildings. Some schools have had it for over 25 years while other schools have
                         never had it in their building.
          927            Political parts of the job. I want a Director who can handle that but is also accessible to the            12/9/2022 4:03 PM
                         teachers. One who is in the schools. And when he/she is, there is not a group of people
                         following him/her.
          928            Continue to move Sumner County Schools forward with the success and support of the                         12/9/2022 4:03 PM
                         director. This includes supporting rigorous instruction to prepare our students for the current
                         world we live in and support them adequately through pay, trainings, and materials
          929            Parents who want to white wash history, eliminate thought-provoking, intellectually challenging,           12/9/2022 4:02 PM
                         and diverse curriculum.
          930            The ever changing community and the acceptance of having to make big changes. The lack of                  12/9/2022 4:02 PM
                         other county leaders realizing that changes need to be made and that gallatin is no longer what
                         it used to be 20 years ago. They will have to face judicial and legislative hurdles that the
                         system has created when it comes to holding kids and parents accountable. They will have to
                         face the challenge of political agendas.
          931            There will be many challenges for the new director. The one that comes to my mind is making                12/9/2022 3:58 PM
                         sure all students receive an equal education no matter their race, income, disability, etc.
          932            Population explosion in our community along with cultural differences from new residents from              12/9/2022 3:57 PM
                         other places.

                         board rather than spoon feeding the board.
          934            Chronic absenteeism, low teacher morale, incompetent administrators at several levels,                     12/9/2022 3:50 PM

                         shouldn't close for election days. Another challenge will be communication with parents. Right
                         now, parents are not included much at all.

                        are leaving the field. The introduction of new school zones has created a division in the county

                        new director must do a better job at presenting multiple options with community input and not 1
                        option that was not discussed with others. An open and 2 way of communication is essential
                        for the new director which is something the current director does not do.

                        push to change the way we teach the children now. There is no need to indoctrinate them.
         1060           Enforcing sanitary habits for reward systems for kids, one specific unsanitary reward system         12/9/2022 1:36 PM
                        is the "Happy Chappy." Teachers have a single chapstick that's shared among the whole
                        school. They let the kids rub some chapstick on their hands if they're good. It's very unsanitary
                        and my kids pediatric office has said they've told schools it's unsanitary to do things like that
                        and they don't listen. I called as a parent to my school and to ask for my kid not get them
                        anymore and was told they've been doing it for years and they love it at their school. I
                        explained she's on her second round of antibiotics and has been sick for 3 months and I just
                        want to get my child feeling better and it might help if she wasn't sharing a communal
                        chapstick. I was then asked if she was in daycare as a baby, I answered no and then was told
                        that's why she's sick I should have put her in daycare because it really does make a
                        difference. So instead of listening to doctors, or hearing out a parent, they chose make the
                        parent feel like it's their fault for being a stay at home mom for their kids as a means of
                        justifying their "Happy Chappy" tradition of a shared bacteria farm stick reward system. You'd
                        think if getting absentee numbers down was really a priority they wouldn't continue such
                        unsanitary practices. A scented sanitizer would have the same effect and not keep the same
                        nasty germs spreading around the school.

          1096          Current Director and Asst. Director have taken SCS too much towards the MNPS model of                12/9/2022 12:59 PM

          1099          There is a political divide that has very vocal opinions on all things education. Being able to      12/9/2022 12:55 PM
                        balance parent support with best practices for students will be key.
          1100          Teacher retention. A director of schools will need to acknowledge that a major component in          12/9/2022 12:55 PM
                        teacher retention (or lack of) is student behavior and teachers feeling as if there is 0
                        accountability to students (and parents) for poor student behavior. In my opinion, holding
                        students accountable to not only behavior standards, but academic standards is important as
                        well. Retaining students that do not meet the standards to advance should be brought back as
                        an option. In regards to program growth, it is a good thing that SCS is continuing to expand the
                        types of programs offered to students, but those programs are going to need to be adequately
                        supported. Finally, I think a new director of schools will need to address the situation of
                        building maintenance and develop a plan to adequately provide for the upkeep of our older
                        buildings.

                        individuals; students and parent. If the new director cares about the students, he will face an
                        uphill battle. The board will not compromise or listen. That will make communication extremely

                        teaching CRT, because that’s the only place it’s taught, so they will need to combat that
                        theory.

                        backwards in credentials. I hope we can find someone with experience as a teacher and
                        principal who has a doctoral degree and ideally is familiar with Sumner County and its current
                        political climate. Our director must be able to recognize the diversity of our student population
                        and make decisions based on what’s fair for all students regardless of personal political
                        opinions so students of all faiths, genders, sexual orientations, and economic statuses feel
                        safe, valued, and are able to learn and thrive. The new director must be familiar with the
                        movements working to take away the reading rights of our students, our schools’ rights to
                        support the emotional needs of it’s students, and our curriculum experts' abilities to implement
                        the best curricula for Sumner County Students. We have a vocal minority of citizens who do
                        not like critical thinking and wants to enforce their values onto everyone under the guise of
                        indoctrination accusations. Some of the loudest voices are often those who don’t even have
                        children in our school system. We need a director who can show support and respect for our

                        who want to lambast public schools in general as they crusade against curricula, books, and

          1142          The new director will need to be able to unify the parents of our county. Many have lost faith in     12/9/2022 12:18 PM
                        the board and director because they do not feel heard. Outreach and communication with
                        parents is critical. Decisions may not always be what they want, but at least they feel heard.
                        Standing up for those that have no voice is also essential. Too many kids are bullied and left
                        out because of their race, sexual orientation, gender, etc. These kids should be able to feel
                        safe in their schools not only from outside threats, but also from their peers, teachers, and
                        other parents. The director should stand for teaching the whole truth in our schools even if it is
                        an uncomfortable subject. The director should stand against standardized testing as a
                        measure of success.

                        priority in every decision. This will not be easy, considering that everyone he/she works with
                        will have an agenda of some kind.

                        board changes as compensation strategies will likely be a part of the recruitment needs. If
                        implementing their new vision for the district's success will require staff restructuring and a
                        mind shift for future success. Retention of current staff with the fear of potential change and

                        aren't getting watched at recess in elementary schools in sumner county but other than that

         1174           1)Teacher retention will be a challenge: One factor of retention is burnout and stress. Teachers     12/9/2022 11:58 AM
                        face many physical and emotional health needs due to the nature of the job. There is a
                        physical and mental health crisis among educators in general, but instead of building them up
                        in those ways (it’s not just about having good health insurance for WHEN teachers have health
                        issues because they inevitably do due to stress and lack of time for self-care), they just get
                        more responsibility that adds to their physical/mental load without support/compensation. 2)
                        Bringing the existing schools up to par with the extravagance of Liberty Creek - not necessarily
                        in terms of facilities, but in terms of equipment/furniture/supplies, etc. New computers are
                        great and necessary but staff members at many schools are using desks and chairs from the
                        1970's and 80's and are told that there is no budget for it when LC has electric standing desks
                        for staff that is not even there yet. 3) County growth: Balancing enrollment in those growth
                        zones is a looming challenge - will we need other schools? And keeping the balance in the
                        meantime when some schools are overstaffed, and some are understaffed during the growth is
                        another challenge the new director will face. 4) Many new directors in other parts of the
                        state/country seem to be hired as an arm of diversity. Although this should be a factor, it
                        should not override the culture and community of Sumner County. This district is not in critical
                        need of a balance in this area currently. 6) I feel that the new director will need to be prepared
                        to work with a county commission that is not as is as school friendly as it been at times in the
                        past.

         1176           I think staffing is a challenge that most school boards face regardless of whether the Director      12/9/2022 11:57 AM
                        is new or not. I don't think that a new director will be challenged by the County Commission,
                        but a new person coming in would have "big shoes" to fill. Dr. Phillips and the Central Office
                        Staff have done a lot of work to build relationships and see that the teachers and students are
                        successful in all aspects of school life.

         1180           He or she will be entering into a divided pro schools group and a group that doesn't seem to         12/9/2022 11:55 AM
                        want to help push education into the future. He or she will have to navigate both factions.

                        need to be able to gain the parents trust that he represents their interests and beliefs not the
                        national teachers unions.
         1184           Trying to be fair to each school. Not every school has the same educational opportunities, but       12/9/2022 11:53 AM
                        they should.
         1185           Political pressure from outside groups pushing their agendas                                         12/9/2022 11:52 AM

         1187           As a conservative county, the new Director will face push back for any change or progressive         12/9/2022 11:52 AM
                        thinking. I certainly hope the Board and other decision makers will not let this deter them in
                        hiring someone who is more progressive, culturally responsive, and interested in DEI
                                                                          108 / 155

                       wasted county-wide PLs. I have been in the district almost a decade, and I continue to leave
                       wanting for more on county-wide PL days.

                       Also, while Wit & Wisdom is an okay curriculum it has issues. One of those is that it is written
                       for average students - so struggling students get left behind and gifted/higher students are not
                       challenged. Anything that is standardized, whether curriculum or tests, is not good for
                       students.

                        gets the majority of the focus. There are existing schools in desperate need updates and
                        investment. My kids attend Gallatin High School which is nearly 50 years old and is the largest
                        school in the district. When the new LC schools came online, they didn't reduce the numbers
                        at the already overcrowded school. As the largest and most diverse school, economically and
                        racially, it should get a larger investment to upgrade and bring facilities up to the LC standards.
                        Just look at the track as an example of neglect at the school. There are many challenges in
                        the county and equitably educating all students across the entire county, not just the most
                        affluent, should be important focus for any new director.

                        vast majority of the stakeholders will be supportive of a continuation of the common sense and
                        practical approach that has been exhibited these past eleven years. In addition, the new
                        director can expect more challenges from the current county commission as to funding and
                        support of school programs and initiatives.

         1237           As always the budget is a major problem. The classified workers in the county are the back           12/9/2022 11:25 AM
                        bone of the system and the most underpaid. Each school building depends heavly on all
                        classidfied workers to keep things running smoothly. The classified people barely make
                        minimum wage when you take out the cost of insurance anad then taxes, the dollar amount for
                        all of the hours they put in do not even eaqual 7.25 an hour. The most disturbing paret of this is
                        when the director HAS TO convince the County Commission to approve a raise examnple of
                        6% the cost of insurance goes up 4% so that in reality the worker see no raise.After working in
                        the school system for 22 years a monthly check including 20 extra hours of bus duty per
                        month the take home pay is $1,150.00 per month.That is not a livign wage. 85% of classified
                        workers work 2 and someitmes 3 different part time jobs to try to make ends meet. With out
                        the support staff of classified in all areas the schools would fall behind in keeping individual
                        scools running in an orderly manner because of the ditues that are taken on to help the
                        teachers and Administrators focus on the business of education.
         1238           Keeping the focus on the standards and not on political hot topics that have nothing to do with      12/9/2022 11:24 AM

                         is imperative they find a way to retain high quality teachers. There are districts that are not
                         facing the shortage we are.

                         students. They are only worried about power and being in control. The new director will have to
                         confront this head-on, or we will be back in the same boat (not enough funding) we were in prior
                         to Dr. Phillips' tenure. We need a director with first-hand experience of what is going on in

                         would be nice if employees were asked to also give feedback about their supervisors. Our

                         what teachers and schools actually do. Also, I think an ever present challenge is the need to
                         set a vision, keep it simple, and maintain and support that vision over the long term without
                         constantly getting sucked into every new education fad that pops up. Long term vision, steady

          1292           The biggest challenge will be dealing with the community and the stances that people take             12/9/2022 11:05 AM
                         regarding books, SEL, behavior supports, etc. In addition, there is a significant teacher
                         shortage that will continue to impact schools - especially in schools that serve our most at
                         need students. We need someone who can think outside of the box and who is willing to try
                         new things.
          1293           Fighting the loud minority of people who want to mesh politics with education. The new leader         12/9/2022 11:05 AM
                         must be able to successfully navigate this current difficult climate and choose what is best for

                         approach these issues with student learning opportunities in mind. Also, equitable learning
                         opportunities may be an issue. For example, our schools have varied distinct programs/clubs
                         that may limit student participation simply because it not offered at their zoned school.
          1296           Fiscal, curriculum problems, diversity and inclusion                                                  12/9/2022 11:04 AM
          1297           Zoning wars, keeping up with technology (our schools are somehow not 1:1. My students do              12/9/2022 11:04 AM
                         not often learn using technology)
          1298           A new director of schools will face the following: a lack of special education teachers and           12/9/2022 11:04 AM
                         support staff; teachers leaving the field all together because of the lack of pay being

                        commiserate with the cost of living for the area; teachers burnt out on curriculum that does not
                        meet the needs of ALL levels of students without completely being modified and
                        supplemented; too much testing and not enough teaching.
         1299           There are some highly opinionated people in this county. While there are people on both sides     12/9/2022 11:04 AM
                        of the aisle, the highly conservative people tend to yell louder even if they are on the wrong
                        side of the law/history. The new Director needs to have a back bone to stand up to those
                        people who are very vocal and let things roll off their backs because this person will be called
                        names and berated in person, in email, and on sites such as FB.
         1300           Supporting teachers and not playing into politics.                                                12/9/2022 11:03 AM
         1301           Politics with families with money.                                                                12/9/2022 11:03 AM

         1303           A growing desire to control individual school decisions from a central location and a move        12/9/2022 11:03 AM
                        away from school autonomy.
         1304           growth and making sure that ALL schools receive equal funding from academics to athletics         12/9/2022 11:02 AM
         1305           I think it would be gaining the trust to ensure they have the best interest of every student bo   12/9/2022 11:02 AM
                        matter their background.
         1306           Treating schools with fairness or at least equality. Stop the constant practice of having         12/9/2022 11:02 AM
                        favorites with treatment and exceptions for some but not for those without connections.
                        Address inequality of facilities in the county. Overcrowding in schools but not changing the
                        zones to help relieve the problem. Students shouldn’t have to do without simply because they
                        go to certain schools ( no track or unusable but told we have a < county < track at hhs. How are
                        students from the northern part of the county supposed to use the < county= track? How do you
                        justify state of the art facilities at some schools while ignoring the desperate needs of others?
                        Putting an unnecessary million dollar turf field in a school while other schools in the county
                        have condemned faculties. It’s embarrassing how openly discriminatory the practices are in
                        this county. The areas with a higher percentage of poor students don’t have anywhere near the
                        facilities of those in the higher income areas. We are better than this and ignoring it is only
                        making it worse.
         1307           A challenge a new Director of Schools will face is parents disagreeing on spending and            12/9/2022 11:02 AM
                        curriculum choices.
         1308           we need more counseling services available for the kids. Everyone seems to be incredibly          12/9/2022 11:01 AM
                        overwhelmed.
         1309           Separating religion and race from education. Needs to be simple. Either you pass or fail. And     12/9/2022 11:01 AM
                        still be able to study history and culture. Not opinions.
         1310           The boards unwillingness to increase salary. For example we do not have good subs because         12/9/2022 11:01 AM
                        they do not get paid enough
         1311           Our current Instruction department has no spine whatsoever - Scott Langford lies to parents       12/9/2022 11:01 AM
                        about Wit and Wisdom, while we quietly take out books from the curriculum that parents
                        complain about. He was the ONLY ONE who wanted it. There are some terrible middle school
                        principals that need to be removed - Danny Robinson is unethical, Jackson Howell has
                        boundary issues, Shaun Glasgow is killing Rucker. Jackson Howell is SLEEPING with a
                        teacher in the building, who also happens to be a Central Office employee. The current director

                         real racism and intolerance. I feel that woke culture has taken away from real intolerance.
                         Under no circumstances should any school system keep information about a child from their
                         parents. The school should not be in the position to raise a child, it should be the parents
                         responsibility alone to raise them as they see fit. The new School Director will have to keep
                         teachers unions from dictating woke curriculum. This will be a very difficult challenge. But one
                         that is critical in preventing from happening. This is one of the last areas that have kept this
                         from happening within the school system. Even though it is already started here as well.

                         Several schools in the area need updating esthetically as well as updating for the growth
                         already occurred and future. Far too much money has been placed at liberty schools only
                         because the area is considered affluent. All kids should have the opportunity to be prideful of
                         their school. Liberty creek is a prime example of funds not appropriated correctly.

          1338           A new director is going to face several challenges. The demographic of our district is changing          12/9/2022 10:54 AM
                         at a rapid pace. The established community and stakeholders in the district are not necessarily
                         accepting or acknowledging of these changes and what that requires as a school system. The
                         political climate and expectations of some community members are not necessarily conducive
                         to propelling our district forward and making necessary changes. This is quite possibly the
                         most difficult challenge the director will face.

         1344          Please don’t feel this person has to fill our other directors shoes. He wanted to leave a legacy  12/9/2022 10:52 AM
                       that had nothing to do with our schools but it had all to do with his name. Funding for Liberty
                       School campus did not allow for the other needy schools to be funded. I want someone who
                       cares about the overcrowding and will work with our communities to slow this down.

          1373           I feel like there will be support by the staff around them to help out,If they are willing.               12/9/2022 10:46 AM
          1374           Challenges would be finding their own way without prejudice with people that have been in the             12/9/2022 10:46 AM
                         county for years. When situations arise, they should be handled accordingly and fairly across
                         the board, regardless if spouses or family work for the county or not.
          1375           Budgeting money for pay increases that are needed to hire for the positions that are most                 12/9/2022 10:46 AM
                         needed (Classified) and to keep the people in those positions (custodian, cafeteria, TA's, etc).
          1376           Cultural encapsulation, politics, the need for more diversity, equity and inclusive practices             12/9/2022 10:46 AM
                         (especially in hiring), personal agents of board members (not those of the constituents they
                         serve), buy-in from teachers and paraprofessional staff, community buy-in
          1377           Being new                                                                                                 12/9/2022 10:45 AM
          1378           The new County Commission and the new School Board do not seem to be as much for public                   12/9/2022 10:45 AM
                         education for all, but for their own.
          1379           I would like to see a director that sees the needs of all the schools not just one area. We have          12/9/2022 10:45 AM
                         a lot of schools being ignored. The you have other schools that get everything. Example
                         Liberty creek. Money should be spent across all schools .
          1380           The influx of people moving into our community that is causes serious problems within our                 12/9/2022 10:45 AM
                         school community. These problems include over-crowding of our schools with students that do
                         not speak English and many have never attended school. This is happening without enough
                         qualified teachers to fill all the teaching positions and we do not have enough support staff
                         throughout the county. We have hundreds of students that do not speak English and very few
                         teachers that speak Spanish. I believe this problem is only going to get worse as more people
                         move into Sumner County.
          1381           Teacher shortages, particularly amongst special education classrooms.                                     12/9/2022 10:44 AM
          1382           Uneducated voting population, overworked and underpaid teachers                                           12/9/2022 10:44 AM
          1383           Building morale                                                                                           12/9/2022 10:44 AM
          1384           Budgeting for school repairs, stopping our kids from bringing vapes & drugs into the schools.             12/9/2022 10:44 AM

          1387           politics and angry parents and staff                                                                      12/9/2022 10:44 AM
          1388           Focus on educating, not testing. State wide test results are a poor measurable of learning. I             12/9/2022 10:43 AM
                         can teach someone how to pass a test and they don't learn the actual information.
          1389           Area growth, plain and simple. Families are moving to Sumner County, in part, because of the              12/9/2022 10:43 AM
                         schools (I know we did). Classrooms are getting stretched beyond numbers I feel confident in.
                         I fear that strains on our teachers and system overall will cause the quality of education to fall.
                         Keeping—dare I say increasing—momentum is of paramount importance for the next Director.

                         of allowing a new school to have unnecessary updates and extravagances when the current
                         Magnet school (which is contributing to the district’s high test scores) and so many others are
                         literally falling apart.

         1397           A county commission who hates everyone and everything at the board of education, a teacher           12/9/2022 10:41 AM
                        and staff shortage (without offering more compensation), and just continuing the excellent job
                        that Dr. Phillips has done. Giant shoes to fill!

         1400           The demographics in Sumner County are changing. The Director will need to pay close                  12/9/2022 10:40 AM
                        attention to the schools most affected by this change and be prepared to provide support
                        services (i.e. Dean of Student Behavior, Truancy Clerk at largely populated schools, etc.)
         1401           Public Opinion, Divided Board                                                                        12/9/2022 10:40 AM
         1402           Unfortunately, there will be a huge political component for the new Director. There are several      12/9/2022 10:40 AM
                        groups that are persistent in demands that create a challenge for everyone in the schools. I
                        hope the new director will continue to be a force to these parents and now, school board
                        members, that consistently devalue our work.

         1410           Being able to stand strong against some of the ridiculous and made-up issues such as CRT in          12/9/2022 10:38 AM
                        classrooms, resisting the efforts from Bill Lee to push conservative ideals and initiatives (i.e.
                        Hillsdale College) and most important for Sumner County, ensure there is strategic educational
                        planning to deal with the over-development by county officials. The next person also need to
                        be free of the conflict of interests that Del Phillips obviously had. Don't use our school
                        resources to enrich yourself or your cronies!
         1411           BUDGET! Getting teachers the appropriate pay for the most important job!                             12/9/2022 10:37 AM
         1412           Curriculum                                                                                           12/9/2022 10:36 AM

                        community pushback on curriculum--we DO NOT teach CRT and teachers are not
                        endroctorinating children
         1415           Pto should not pay for all that they do. Playground equipment,copies teachers ect. Also more         12/9/2022 10:36 AM
                        janitors hired. These schools are so dirty.
         1416           putting up with parents and trying to please everyone -it won't happen. Also, having to deal with    12/9/2022 10:36 AM
                        the aftermath of covid. We also need to work on giving teachers power back in school.
         1417           Not jumping on every bandwagon that comes along in education but designing a solid program           12/9/2022 10:36 AM
                        that will EDUCATE our students and set them up to be life-long learners. They will also need to
                        focus on ALL of the schools and not just the Hendersonville schools. And, I think, they will
                        need to keep raising salaries in order to retain and attract workers to ALL positions including
                                                                          118 / 155

                       teachers, aides, bus drivers, cafeteria workers, custodians, etc. And they will need to choose
                       curriculum that will lend itself to having a BALANCED SCHEDULE.
         1418          How to direct funds. Specifically, schools need to be thoroughly equipped with BASIC              12/9/2022 10:36 AM
                       computer needs before we are required to spend millions on innovative technology. The estate
                       left to Sumner Schools for technology should be used to fill basic technology needs, because
                       schools DO NOT have equal technology. Some are one-to-one through Title funding or by
                       being given the best technology to begin with. Some schools that people assume are "rich"
                       and have everything are the ones who don't have enough computers, are not one-to-one, and
                       have to fund-raise to try to get there. We ALL need to be one-to-one in this day and age
                       without having to raise the money ourselves. The County should make sure of that because all
                       students need this and it opens up many more opportunities for them and for the teachers to
                       teach them. Another issue is the political climate in Sumner County. It is VERY "good ole boy"
                       and cliquish. A Director needs to do what is best for the students, not what is going to make
                       him/her look good or what is being pushed by a political group/party. Another challenge is the
                       huge and rapid growth in Sumner County. He/She will have to try to get cooperation from a
                       largely fiscally-conservative population, and masterfully divvy up funds, to provide the school
                       infrastructure needed. We also need someone who believes in teachers, supports teachers,
                       and remembers the difficulties and demands of being a teacher. This person needs to take the
                       legislative and other demands and interpret them in a way that teachers can humanly handle
                       without mentally burning out and physically breaking down. Sumner County needs to
                       appreciate and hold on to the dedicated teachers that they have, who are a valuable
                       commodity in today's market. The Director needs to stand up to factions that are bent on
                       destroying public education in favor of money-making ventures.
         1419          The biggest challenge is trying to work with the new County Commission and trying                 12/9/2022 10:36 AM
         1420          The challenges faced by a new director are multi-faceted. The politics of the position at the     12/9/2022 10:36 AM
                       time will be daunting for the director and the School Board. Managing the expectations of
                       employees, board members, parents, and community members will be challenging (to say the
                       least). Ecomonics will also be a challenge for a new director. Given the current political
                       landscape with regards to funding, a new director will need to navigate some turbulent waters
                       to ensure enough funding without stakeholders feeling that it is too much. Additionally, the
                       influx of families to the district and their economic status can make for challenges. The lack of
                       teacher candidates will be a huge challenge. We must be able to fully staff our schools to
                       ensure a good environment for student learning. I know that we seem to drone on about the

                         discipline policies in this county should be consistent and upheld. Every student in every
                         school should be uniform when it comes to discipline. Some schools will not tolerate chronic
                         discipline issues while others are run in such a way that teachers and students do not feel
                         safe, it is not fair to teachers and students who follow the rules.

                         for lack of support from administration as the whole world worries about law suits. It is a
                         challenge that all school districts face. No one wants to be on the news. I also believe that
                         students involved in extra curricular activities perform better in the classroom. We need to
                         encourage students to be involved in those activities, but we HAVE to change the pay scale
                         for the teachers that Coach/Mentor in those extra curricular activities. We are one of the lowest
                         paying counties for athletic coaches and we have outstanding athletics county wide. There are
                         too many great teachers that are great coaches and aren't being compensated for their time.

                        exists today, will never entirely agree on anything. Whoever takes this job will a challenge
                        working with our board. They will face opposition from a small, but vocal, minority of citizens
                        and board members who care little about education and a lot about low taxes and banning

                        for one or two new magnet schools in Sumner county. Knowing someone or having a lottery to

         1467           Climate of our society. There is so much division we need someone who puts the needs of the         12/9/2022 10:27 AM
                        students as a priority. You will not make everyone happy, some people will complain just to
                        complain or start drama, but if decision made is student-centered and supported in evidence
                        then you will garner more support for your plans. We also need to support and believe in our
                        teacher's more. If we are hiring highly qualified teachers, we can trust them to teach. I think
                        discipline is out of control. More needs to be done to hold students accountable and support
                        teachers and other students in having a safe and educational environment. Many of the high
                        schools have out of control students that are impacting other students negatively. We need
                        more consistency throughout our schools. Some schools offer exemptions, some don't. Why?
                        Dress code is different at different schools...why? These things should not be based on
                        personal opinions, they should be designed around evidence. Therefore, one decision should
                        be made for every policy. One based in evidence.

                        first priority, not politics. Teacher retention is another challenge they will face and finding ways
                        to make teachers feel valued and appreciated should also be addressed.

                        leader who listens and responds to their concerns.

         1480           Replacing such a successful and consistent Director and maintaining the level of dedication to    12/9/2022 10:25 AM
                        high quality instructional practices along with the need for high quality teachers and leaders to
                        support such learning.
         1481           A significant difference in zone/area attention. Although all schools are Sumner County, there    12/9/2022 10:25 AM

         1487           Just the fact that of change. I think the county commission will challenge the new director to    12/9/2022 10:24 AM
                        see if he/she will stick to her guns as Dr. Phillips has in the past to ensure funding.

                        opportunity. Every school should have and look like Liberty Creek. Maintenance, updates, and
                        renovations should be more important than some of the other things money is spent on.

          1502          Gaining the trust and support of the families in the district.                                       12/9/2022 10:22 AM
          1503          Complaints from parents                                                                              12/9/2022 10:22 AM
          1504          I would hope the new director would be welcomed to an environment of partnership and                 12/9/2022 10:22 AM
                        teamwork for the safe of our youth and their educational success. I am always fearful of the
                        good old boy scenario.
          1505          Those wanting to bring politics into education. Leave it out! some principals don’t follow their     12/9/2022 10:22 AM
                        own rules. It would be nice to have all schools in similar compliance. Be fair. Be honest.
          1506          We need to increase coaching salaries in our middle and high schools. This has not been done         12/9/2022 10:22 AM
                        in over 30 years. Surrounding counties are surpassing us in this category big time. Getting the
                        county commission and school board to work together for the best interest of our kiddos is
                        going to be huge.
          1507          The previous director doesn’t have much support. Theres a lot of complaints about                    12/9/2022 10:22 AM
                        mismanaged funds, schools that need improvement. Curriculum is not teaching kids anything.
                        Teachers aren’t allowed to actually teach but just administer tests. Teachers and staff are
                        ridiculously under paid and overworked. Not a lot of family support.
          1508          Sumner County is ever growing. Challenged he or she may face will be our community voice             12/9/2022 10:22 AM
                        as there are a lot of families that feel strong in the zoning of Liberty Creek. Gallatin High
                        School is still over crowded with a new high school and outdated.
          1509          I believe Sumner County is very behind the innovation and modernization of digital media             12/9/2022 10:22 AM
                        found in adjacent counties that neighbor Davidson County and Metro Nashville. I would love to
                        see a more proactive leader involved in advancements in innovation and putting our county
                        schools on par with the very best schools in the state when it comes to technology,
                        communication and digital development, preferably those in Williamson and Rutherford
                        counties. I believe the biggest challenge of the director is to be forward thinking and recognize
                        the new opportunities that await Sumner County Schools, and not be tied to or aligned with
                        outdated circles of influences and leaders which have slowed the growth of the county in
                        modern times. This county has changed rapidly and I would like to see the education system
                        match or be on par with the rapid economic and modern growth of our residential and
                        commercial areas and I believe our CTE programs and educational opportunities are about 10
                        years behind where they should be, especially when it comes to technology and student
                        access of digital and modern careers.
          1510          I perceive the director is entering a difficult political climate in the district with the county    12/9/2022 10:22 AM
                        commission having an ideological belief in the majority that presents differently than it has

          1512          A diverse school board and county commission wide a wide array of voices. And a community            12/9/2022 10:21 AM

          1515          Although diversity is being normalized that doesn’t mean it’s being accepted. A few challenges       12/9/2022 10:21 AM
                        a director of school will face is handling situations that involve bullying of disabled kids or
                        people with different ethnicities than people are more likely to see.

                        students. Writing them up is something the kids find laughable. It does not work! Give
                        teachers some useful tools.
         1520           Lack of easily accessible and clearly defined district-wide polices, poorly-defined               12/9/2022 10:21 AM

                        teachers cannot afford to live within the county/school zones, even with higher education.
         1522           Shortage of certified teachers. Hiring teachers that are not certified is a mistake. They are not 12/9/2022 10:21 AM
                        qualified if they have not worked for their degree.
         1523           The woke agenda and ideology. Keeping crap out of school that should be kept out of school.       12/9/2022 10:21 AM
                        Teachers should stick to the curriculum standards. There is no place for critical race theory or
                        gender ideology in schools. Or teachers pushing their liberal beliefs in schools. More kids need
                        mental health counseling these days for many reasons from social media to confused of who
                        they are, but a counselor should never affirm the child who is having confusing feelings. My
                        sons a junior and has had a teacher this year who pushed a lot of liberal agendas in class.
                        There is no place for that.
         1524           Learning to adapt to different types of school needs: Sumner County Schools is very diverse in    12/9/2022 10:21 AM
                        that it encompasses urban, suburban, and rural schools each with distinct community and
                        school needs. Schools in the different areas of the County have different levels of community
                        financial support as well.
         1525           Political polarization in the community that is bleeding into school issues, a contentious        12/9/2022 10:21 AM

         1539           I think that the new Director will face a lot of backlash on all forums of social media and       12/9/2022 10:20 AM
                        whoever gets the position will need to have a thick skin so to speak and not let it cause worry
                        and anxiety...I think that as each school year gets harder that he may how to come up with a
                        plan to help teachers not be so overwhelmed with more paperwork and let those teachers
                        teach because that is the reason they chose this career...They just want to teach and see a
                        student when they finally "get" it.. Most of all I think that he will have to be willing to adapt and

                        positions that do not require a teaching license should not be paid more than classified
                        personnel doing essentially the same job. Schools should not staffed based on the needs of
                        the needs/characteristics of their student population rather than population size or age. For
                        instance, some schools have a lot more student turn over than others; for this reason, an
                        additional attendance clerk position may be needed; some schools have a student population
                        that suffers from more poverty or behavioral issues so that school may need more guidance
                        counselors, social workers, etc than other schools. And, some schools have active PTOs and
                        those students get lots of extras that schools without active PTOs don't get. It's not fair to
                        deprive students because their parents are not active in their education. Student behavior in
                        the classroom needs to be addressed. There is so much disturbance from students with
                        behavioral issues that "regular" students' learning in impacted negatively - not to mention
                        teacher morale. The new director should make it a point to spend more time with "boots on the
                        ground" to learn about each school and their student populations and needs.

         1598           The newly elected school board and rise of anti-public education community/parent groups is a        12/9/2022 10:13 AM
                        threat to our public schools. The director should be prepared to show the community that
                        public schools meet the needs of students in ways that charter schools historically have not.
         1599           He/she will need to approach situations in the mindset of a teacher or someone who actually          12/9/2022 10:13 AM
                        works within the school. It is in my opinion that they are too many people who make decisions
                        about how a school should run without ever having been in the classroom themselves.
         1600           The public is very divided and combative. It will be difficult trying to satisfy everyone.           12/9/2022 10:13 AM

                        important, but a director who will stand their ground on important decisions in regard to their
                        staff and students is imperative to have cohesive unit.

         1609           I believe the Director of Schools will need to fight for the funding needed. Our district is not     12/9/2022 10:11 AM
                        funded as completely as it should be.
         1610           Stepping into the shoes of a director that has been with us as along as Dr. Phillips has. He will    12/9/2022 10:11 AM

                        100% staffed. A director cannot be scared to take teachers or lead educators from other

         1613          Sumner county needs to address the lack of technology in classrooms. Not all schools are        12/9/2022 10:11 AM
                       treated equally. Sumner county had the opportunity with Covid funds to purchase classroom
                       technology such as touch panels, but instead bought hand sanitizer. Yet in the new schools,
                       Sumner county placed touch panels sun classrooms while schools such as Howard got
                       nothing.
         1614          There is a small, but vocal group of community members who are focused on micro-managing        12/9/2022 10:11 AM
                       curriculum, and in some cases wanting to forbid the teaching of the accurate history of our
                       country. Most of these members are not parents of Sumner County public school students. I
                       am hoping that the new director will not bend toward the fascist demands of these people. We
                       should NOT become a school system that bans books. The new director should embrace
                       diversity, not ignore it. Teaching the accurate history to children should remain.

         39           ABSOLUTELY NOT SCOTT LANGFORD!! He likes to work with the good ole boy system and           12/16/2022 9:35 AM
                      if a position opens for many the only candidate to be hired is who he knows from White House
                      to cater to his good ole boy system. That is not a good way of doing business. He also likes to
                      go against the rules and regulations of the county. He is not a good fit and I know many that he
                      works with daily that are great employees that will quit at the board if he is chosen.

         88             NOT Langford!! There is a total disconnect when it comes to what he deems important in               12/15/2022 3:12 PM
                        education and what is important to a typical Sumner county household. He also shows no
                        respect for this counties loyal school employees that put in 50+ hours a week with no extra
                        pay or complaints by employees because we love our students.

                        who should be considered. Who should be the next Director of Schools? I would like to see an
                        active principal or long tenured teacher who has spent the past few years dealing first hand
                        with the ramifications of decisions made by our Board of Education….someone who has truly
                        been in the same boat with the rest of us and not just the same storm. I would also like the
                        candidate to have no political ties in Sumner County, meaning a former elected official,
                        candidate or activist (as in someone who has provided significant financial support or volunteer
                        time to candidates).

         155            I would like to see someone who has had a wide array of experience in the classroom, and has       12/14/2022 3:14 PM
                        worked as an administrator. I believe I would like to see a woman in this role. I do not
                        remember a woman holding this position in Sumner County. Ultimately, I want the best person
                        for the job. They could even have a background in business, but the main focus of their
                        experience must be in schools and the classroom. I hope to see a principled, decisive, leader
                        who will listen to the parents and caregivers, the students, the administrators, and the
                        teachers. I will be praying for each of you as you work through this process.
         156            No specific person. Please find a conservative leader; no more 'woke' personnel need apply!        12/14/2022 2:07 PM

                         our community too, but there could be clear advantages to hiring from within if the right
                         candidate is already here..

          391            Whatever it takes for Scott Langford to not get the job. He is politically correct, but minimal        12/10/2022 7:27 AM

                        technology and standardization with technology. We live in a technology work whether we want
                        to or not. It is time that we invest in being able to run schools in modern day. Even school and
                        the board websites are so outdated and not very useful.

                       has been within the county. I think that those that work at the board are out of touch with the
                       reality of the schools within our system, and I also think that we have enough talent here in
                       Sumner County, Tennessee to never outsource a superintendent position to anyone from
                       Mississippi, Alabama, Louisiana, or other lower-ranked education states again.

         548            Scott Langford has the most experience and knowledge of the district. I think this would really      12/9/2022 1:02 PM
                        prevent a waste of time that an outsider would have trying to get adjusted and familiar with
                        everything. I think Scott Langford would continue to do great work and move the district
                        forward.

         571            Scott Langford is our assistant director for instruction. Scott is a native of Sumner County. He     12/9/2022 12:23 PM
                        has worked in our district as a teacher, administrator and assistant director. He understands
                        where our district has been and the amazing growth that has happened under Dr. Phillips
                        tenure here. Scott knows the administrators, teachers and students of Sumner county and
                        would do a fantatsic job.

                        outside of our system. I think the search committee needs to look at not continuing to make

         590            I would like to see Scott Langford be promoted from within our county if he is interested in that   12/9/2022 11:57 AM
                        position. I think he is a great communicator. He has been in the classroom, worked in
                        curriculum and instruction, and has experience working with the County Commission. He is
                        also a person from this community/area. I would like to see us hire someone from this or
                        surrounding counties. I definitely want us to have someone from Tennessee.

         592            The candidate needs to be from the from the southeast and reflect the values of our area.           12/9/2022 11:54 AM
                        Would prefer an independent candidate not someone who has been a member of or endorsed
                        by national teachers unions. The
         593            I believe it should be someone that is willing to stand up to the woke mob that wants to            12/9/2022 11:52 AM
                        indoctrinate kids with inappropriate materials. This person needs a strong backbone not
                        necessarily a background in education.

         601            Please just someone outside the district. We hit a home run with Dr. Philips. Many times          12/9/2022 11:43 AM

                        negativity they’ve experienced. Even thought that negativity may have been valid. A fresh set

                        Superintendent (and former MNPS principal) Sonia Stewart. She might not be available herself
                        (I don't know), but I would absolutely trust any recommendation of hers. Vanderbilt would also
                        be an excellent resource in this search, given their strong education eadership program.

                          that loves Sumner County.

          741             In my opinion, both Scott Lanford (current Associate Director) and Ron Becker (current                     12/9/2022 10:29 AM
                          principal at Gallatin High School) should be considered. Both are strong candidates with long-
                          standing ties to our community and a good understanding of our school system. Either would
                          do an outstanding job for our students and stakeholders.
          742             No particular person as long as they are from Sumner county and live in this county.                       12/9/2022 10:28 AM
