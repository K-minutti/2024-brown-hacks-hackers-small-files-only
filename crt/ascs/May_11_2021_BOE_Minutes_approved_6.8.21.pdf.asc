                                   •    7 Adult Education students have completed graduation requirements this year.  
                                   •    40 K-12 students have completed graduation requirements as of May 4. 
                                   •    Fall Semester 2021-nearly 2,000 college credits were earned by 273 students.

                               Superintendent Rogers stated that after consulting with his cabinet and looking at data, 
                               he recommends we return to face-to-face instruction five days a week for the 2021 -
                               2022 school year. One of those days is an early release day. Superintendent Rogers also 
                               recommended keeping the early release day on Friday for secondary schools as it works 
                               betters with our educational partners of Utah State University and Tooele Technical 
                               College and moving the early release day for grades k-6 back to Wednesday.  
                                
                               Member Bryan expressed concern that splitting the early release day between two 
                               different days will create a hardship for some parents. Rick Harrison, President of the 
                               Tooele Education Association, stated that when TEA surveyed teachers, elementary

                               teachers overwhelmingly wanted to return to Wednesday early that day while 
                               secondary teachers were somewhat split.

                               the June Board meeting.  Member  Gowans stated he felt waiting for the June Board 
                               meeting would be too late as schools are already starting to work on their schedules for 
                               next year.

                               Member Mouritsen stated that his nay vote was more procedural. He felt the public 
                               should have been apprised that the item was an action item and that moving the early 
                               release day to Wednesday was up for consideration.  Member Bryan stated he didn't 
                               know that they were discussing the option of splitting early release days.  
                               Member Shields stated she was comfortable with the recommendation as she had heard 
                               from many patrons and felt they have been paying attention to the schedule next year 
                               and had voiced their opinions on the matter.
