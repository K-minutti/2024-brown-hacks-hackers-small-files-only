             Page 5 
                             motion is a preliminary tax levy of $89,986,352. The budget adoption format is on page 3 and the tax 
                             levy summary on page 4 of the budget booklet (in Boarddocs) for review. With the approval of the 
                             Board tonight, the preliminary budget will be presented to the public at the Budget Hearing on 
                             September 15, 2021 at 6:30 p.m., prior to the regularly scheduled Board Meeting. The final 2021-2022 
                             budget and tax levy will be approved in October. P. McCaffery moved to approve the 2021-2022

                     B.   Discussion/Information Items: 
                          1.  Monthly Budget Report: Revenues and expenditures continue to be within budgeted limits for both the 
                             General and Special Education Fund. The district is operating in accordance with our approved budget 
                             in all other funds as well 
                           
                          2.  2021-2022 Fiscal Year End Update: Due to the many unknowns in a pandemic year, a projected deficit 
                             of $1.9 million was budgeted for the 20-21 school year. This deficit included contingencies for covid 
                             response and would come from fund balance. Our pre-audit numbers are showing we finished the year 
                             with a surplus of $3.8 million, primarily due to higher than anticipated eAchieve open enrollment 
                             numbers, a higher-than-normal amount of Medicaid reimbursement, and health claims remaining at a 
                             low level. Next month the Committee will be discussing designating $4,000,000 of this surplus into the 
                             Reserved Fund Balance for future health claims. This will be agendized as an action item next month. 
                           
                          3.  Long Range Planning: As discussed in the past, we are facing a structural deficit of $3 million per year. 
                             While the normal budgeting process starts in November, if there is going to be any significant changes 
                             in operation for the 2022-2023 school year, we will need to begin the process much earlier. Board 
                             workshops will be scheduled for September and October to discuss the causes of the structural deficit 
                             and potential solutions.

                             relocating the broadcast equipment to another location.

                             evaluated their current scope and sequence, and examined the standards and proficiencies for social 
                             studies at the middle school level. The team also vetted a variety of curricular resources to support 
                             student learning as they are planning to pilot these resources in the Fall of 2021. 
                           
                          4.  High School English Update: G. Deets explained that in 2020, the Wisconsin DPI released revised 
                             standards for English Language Arts. Rachel Hermann, Director of Secondary Learning and Dr. Nancy

                        5.  High School Social Emotional Learning, Character Strong Update: Director of Student Services, Luke 
                            Pinion, and South High Assistant Principal Maria D’Amato-Kuche, brought a report to the T&L 
                            Committee about a new resource for Social Emotional Learning (SEL) lessons at the high school level. 
                            Specifically, they shared information about a pilot of Character Strong, an evidence-based SEL 
                            program that would replace self-created lessons. These intend to develop students’ skills around 
                            building community, relationships, healthy habits, resiliency, stress regulation, communication, and 
                            other essential life skills. These skills are aligned to the WI Department of Public Instruction SEL 
                            Competencies.

                            administration of the Measures of Academic Progress (MAP) Assessment. This test was administered 
                            to our students in grades K-8 and was given three times this school year. Testing three times per year 
                            will be the expected practice for schools moving forward.
