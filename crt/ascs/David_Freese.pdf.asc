        I am writing to question the assembly on critical race theory. What benefit is there pitting one race against 
        another have to justice? This makes no sense. Teachers need to teach the basics with proven facts and 
        not step into theory that says because you are one race you have a privilege over another. Have you 
        lived in Anchorage your whole life like I have? I have friends of all races and creeds, rich and poor, and 
        that is because I lived here in one of the most diverse cities in America. We all know racism exists and it 
        is not just one race that is racist. It is not prevalent though and it should be the family's responsibility to 
        teach about people's differences not yours. Thank you.
