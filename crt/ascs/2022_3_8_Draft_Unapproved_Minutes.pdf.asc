       Action (Consent), Information. 7. G.
       Background Information:
       The District issued a Request for Proposal (RFP) on February 21, 2018 that requested qualified vendors to submit proposals to the
       District to provide Team/Branded Merchandise, such as athletic apparel, team uniforms and footwear. RFP responses were due on
       March 21, 2018. Christopher Mucica, Instructional Specialist for Athletics determined an RFP to be a viable option to manage
       purchase orders, monitor and control delivery schedules, and access additional partner benefits.  The additional partner benefits
       would provide increased value to the District and its students in the form of services such as coaching clinics, internship
       opportunities and reward programs. The RFP was awarded to ADPRO Sports at the June 12, 2018 Board of Education meeting.
        
       Pertinent Information:
       As per terms of the RFP, the District has the authority to issue an extension to this agreement. As part of this requested extension
       ADPRO Sports has agreed to increase the discount an additional 5% for certain uniforms and apparel.

      B. 2022 Elementary School Air Conditioning Capital Project
      Information: 19. B.
      Background
      The Williamsville Central School District has a history of completing capital project work that maintains our buildings and sites at a
      level that supports our educational programs.  The purpose of a capital project is different than the completion of facility repairs
      and maintenance. The latter work is done every day of the year and it addresses minor building operational items.  This work does
      not involve the total renovation of space or replacement of significant building components or systems.  Capital project work is
      completed if new building components or space becomes necessary for instructional purposes or when it has been determined that
      continuing to repair a particular item is not cost effective.  This results in the need to add or replace the item.  Some examples of
      items that are classified as capital project items include roof replacement, window and door replacement, driveway-bus loop
      reconstruction, building fire alarm replacement, and major classroom reconstruction.  Capital project items qualify for New York
      State Education Department building aid payments.  The aid is provided to the District over a 15-year period of time and it is
      included in the District’s total state aid number that is incorporated into the annual General Fund revenue budget. 
       
      Timeline
      A proposition will be provided to the Community on May 17, 2022.  If approval is received it will result in the installation of air
      conditioning in all elementary school classrooms, libraries, cafeterias, multi-purpose rooms (where applicable), auditoriums (where
      applicable) and the dehumidification of the gyms.  The project will also include replacing the main electrical service at East High
      school.  This service was originally installed in 1975.  It is past its life expectancy and repair of the transformers and switches is
      becoming impossible due to their age and our inability to obtain parts for the repairs.
