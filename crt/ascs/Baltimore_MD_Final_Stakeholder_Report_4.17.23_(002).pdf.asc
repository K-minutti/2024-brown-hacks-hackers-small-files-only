       McPherson and Jacobson assembled a team to conduct stakeholder group meetings including 
       consultants, Dr. Tawana Grover, Dr. Judy Sclair-Stein, Dr. Carl Harris and Robert Copeland. 
       From March 20-23 and April 1, the Board of education scheduled a total of 25 focus group 
       meetings and six town hall meetings to gain insight from a diverse group of stakeholders from 
       across the county.

       community members, parents, support staff, students, teachers, and union representatives. The

       Schools. All stakeholder groups were afforded the opportunity to respond to the same set of four

                 1.  Tell us the good things about your community.
                         •   It’s very diverse. Poverty and mansions go to the same schools.
                         •   History of the county.  People couldn’t wait to move to the county and a desire to
                             have it that way again.
                         •   Many families have been here all their lives.  Heritage.
                         •   A rich history of civil rights
                         •   Very active NAACP chapters
                         •   Also, very diverse immigrant communities.  Resilient immigrant communities.
                         •   The proximity of resources is strong, including industries and jobs
                         •   Work internships for the school system
                         •   Rich commercial tax base.  People are coming to Baltimore, which leads to people
                             wanting to be here.
                         •   The CPC system is good
                         •   It is an urban school system
                 2.  Tell us the good things about the Baltimore County Public Schools.
                         •   27 High school programs
                         •   Focus on community school wrap-around services.  Health clinics.
                         •   Technical training programs
                         •   Skilled and talented teaching staff
                         •   History of developing things here.  Weird that we are buying curriculum.
                         •   Great partner teaching program supporting new teachers
                         •   Within special education.  Good job of meeting kids where they are. Maintaining a
                             strong program.
                 3.  What issues should the superintendent be aware of as he/she comes into the Baltimore
                     County Public Schools?
                         •   Special Ed programs are out of compliance.  Set up to cause failure.
                         •   Bloating and underserviced in the central office
                         •   The great need in support for kids but not just passing them on
                         •   Needs to be active recruitment of teachers and a retention program.  Nothing has
                             changed in the retention program, and the needs of new educators have changed.
                         •   Teachers leave to go to other counties for more pay
                         •   Alternative schools do not have support.  All behavior but not support.

                         •   The school system needs to collaborate between the county and within the school
                             system.  Part of being a part of Baltimore County and coming to the County meetings
                             to recruit.
                         •   Baltimore Schools need to <fly their flags=.
                         •   Lack of transparency of how things work, for example, the hiring process
                         •   Customer service center didn’t do what was touted.  Communication is not what it
                             should be.  All this is very reactive.  Systemic fixes need to be in place.
                                                                    4 
                    •  Communication often goes to the community before staff and staff doesn’t know
                    •  A Ransomware situation occurred in 2020, and the district still uses that as an excuse
                    •  A retention bonus is being given in April, and that won’t stop someone leaving at the
                       end of the year.

                       Spanish.
                    •  Look at why things are so focused on the central area.  Population density is still
                       closer to the city.
                    •  Facility issues. Old buildings, mold, unusable.  Alot of kids learning in trailers.
                    •  The efficiency review was not helpful.  They just checked a box.  Caused short-
                       sighted decisions.  Silos, too many decisions were made high up.
              4. What skills, qualities or characteristics should the new superintendent possess to be
                 successful in the Baltimore County Public Schools?

                       didn’t listen to us.
                    •  See the realities of the school system. Kids who are in real need.
                    •  Need accountability at the higher levels.
                    •  Transparency on the budget.  Authentic input from people in the schools.
                    •  Inspirational to students and us.  No question about self-dealing.
                    •  Restore relationships
                    •  Take this input and reflect on it
                    •  When I go to meetings, most of the people are defensive and don’t listen to the reality
                       of the classroom.
                    •  Ability to make a decision
                    •  Ruthless when necessary. The central office needs to be tough.
                    •  An honest equity commitment.
                    •  The superintendent needs to recognize that equity and advocate for unconventional
                       approaches.

                         •   Low numbers of support staff.  People are doing multiple jobs because of open
                             positions.  Short-staffed.
                         •   Compared to other larger counties we have much more central staff.  New positions

                         •   Staff is quickly accused of things.  Guilty until proven innocent.
                         •   What do you do when restorative practices don’t work
                         •   We want to be compensated better.

                         •   Try to benefit kids from diverse backgrounds. I don’t see any deficiencies.
                         •   I’ve always had access to the supt.  Always had access to the principals.  If I had to
                             judge the schools by my son and grandchildren, this would be a good school system.
                         •   The district listens to the people that come to the board, including this superintendent
                         •   Dual enrollment program between CCBC and BCPS…potential that can really close
                             gaps. (Community College and Baltimore Public Schools). (Some things can fall
                             through the cracks…and it could use more work.
                         •   Magnet programs….we need more and more variety, but they are beneficial 
                         •   AVID…College and Career program. Alternative for those who can’t get into the

                 3.  What issues should the superintendent be aware of as he/she comes into the Baltimore
                     County Public Schools?
                         •   The political climate.  How do you relate to the county executive and the state
                             neighborhoods?
                         •   And the diverse groups are often in conflict
                         •   Shortage of teachers and then train them and retain them in the system
                         •   BC is very segregated.  Significant, maybe 15 different education coalitions.  For
                             example. There is an overcrowded school, but they don’t want their child redistricted
                             to alleviate the problem.
                         •   BCPS is dealing with school facility repairs.  Had a supt <Dr. White,= who did a great
                             job but the state supt denied her the job.
                         •   Hereford wants to separate from Baltimore County
                         •   Dual enrollment program between CCBC and BCPS…potential that can really close
                             gaps. (Community College and Baltimore Public Schools). (Some things can fall
                             through the cracks…and it could use more work.
                         •   Course registration guide, as of 2020 the incoming freshmen have a new enrollment
                             guide.  BCPS has an alignment with CCBC, must have 6 years of math, the U. of
                             MD, wants to better prepare students who are going to college.  EX:  Student as an 8th
                             grader is accepted for dual enrollment at CCBC.  However, if student has already
                             taken a dual enrolled math at the college level, the student shouldn’t have to take
                             math at the high school level.  But the student had to take math at the high school
                             level at the same time.  As a student is matriculating through math, there should be an
                             intersect at some point; at the present time there isn’t one.  There are several other
                             courses that are impacted in a similar way.
                         •   Consequently, students are discouraged from pursuing the dual enrollment courses,
                             particularly those with IEP’s and other lower achieving students.
                         •   Mental health issues; impacting our children in a greater way than we can even
                             fathom; many things are affecting them than we can even imagine
                         •   Standardized test scores with college board; students with disabilities have to go to
                             college board to get their accommodations approved.  If there are no facilities that can
                             provide accommodations approved…there has to be a collaboration with CCBC.
                         •   If students from BCPS have disabilities….if they expanded their outreach services to 
                             CCBC, it would enhance their ability to be able to get their accommodations at the 
                             community college level…Right now the options are: Change dates, Take test 
                             without accommodations, or Get a refund. 
                         •   Students with disabilities must have accommodations for standardized tests
                             somewhere within our county.

                         •   Hearing from a large majority of students and parents about the quality of teaching in
                             our classrooms has diminished.
                         •   Children’s concerns are that they are being taken into the classroom is that they are
                             given a device and being told to read something on their device and that’s their
                             tutelage for the day.
                                                                   11 
                    •  Teachers just show up and have them read.  We’re just setting our children up for
                       failure.  My son is transitioning to private school for his high school education….top 
                       linebacker. 
                    •  My son was not well-equipped for taking the standardized tests.  What about those
                       children who are left behind.
                    •  We are doing our children a disservice
                    •  We need a better standard with regard to our substitutes.  We need our teachers and
                       subs need to know their content areas.
                    •  Educational Leadership must be held accountable…principals cannot protect the
                       teacher and not the students.
                    •  How our teachers show up in general; they are dealing with mental health stuff as
                       well.  Teachers are coming into the classrooms in a frenzy.
                    •  Bring in more well-qualified teachers.
                    •  Hold all accountable.

          12             I believe one of Baltimore County's best attributes is its diversity. People from all walks of life      3/30/2023 11:38 AM
                         and all parts of the world call Baltimore County home, and this is reflected in the school
                         system. Just as the state of Maryland is sometimes referred to as "America in miniature," I
                         believe you can also refer to Baltimore County as "America in miniature." In addition, I feel
                         Baltimore County residents respect one another, even if they disagree and may have varying
                         opinions on a given topic. I also love the different landscapes in Baltimore County. You have
                         the neighborhoods that border Baltimore City and have more of an urban feel, and then you
                         have more rural areas, with farm animals and rolling hills. It's just a nice place to live.
          13             Supportive, small-town feel, diverse.                                                                    3/30/2023 6:52 AM

                         responses are through that lens. Over the years, I have witnessed many positive employee-
                         employer interactions and relationships. However, over the past 15 years I have witnessed an 
                         over-abundance of administrator-filled positions with an overall decrease in classified positions. 
                         Whomever the next Superintendent is, that individual must have a vision for this school 
                         system that incorporates decisions made utilizing an equity, racial, and social justice lens so 
                         that it might once again be as successful as it was in the days of ______________. Some 
                         improvements occurred under _________________ and ________________, but not many.

          42            Baltimore County is a thriving area. We have good schools, good medical care, and good               3/27/2023 10:52 AM
                        neighbors.
          43            The community is expanding with development of new homes, and people are starting to renew           3/27/2023 10:49 AM
                        their confidence in public school education and sending their kids back to public from private.
                        Parent involvement and community awareness of school needs is at an all time high. The new
                        homes are paving the way for new businesses and more young professionals are settling in the
                        BCPS zone and buying homes.
          44            Our community is very close knit, and has many families that have sent their children to             3/27/2023 10:39 AM

          46            My community according to others is on wrong side of town. The truth is my community                 3/27/2023 8:58 AM
                        consists of loving and helpful neighbors who look out for each other. My community is an
                        untrue stereotype. My community has NO violence, no open drugs, no people who do not
                        work. My community is beautiful.

          59            My particular community is Catonsville, MD. We have kind of a small town vibe in the midst of         3/26/2023 8:40 PM
                        a large suburban area -- there's only about two degrees of separation among the residents. My
                        school parent friends look out for each other, and each other's kids. It's impossible to catch all
                        of the information out there, and my school parent friends do our best to keep each other
                        informed when we miss the "official" communications.

          61            The Lansdowne community is one of confluence. It borders Baltimore City in the southwest              3/26/2023 6:18 PM
                        area. My school is Lansdowne Middle School. We need better care of our physical plant and
                        its property. Our parking lot has pot holes. We need additional parking for staff so that we do
                        not have to park on Lansdowne Road. It is so dangerous to cross, as cars speed on the
                        stretch of road between the high school and the elementary school, especially in front of our
                        middle school. We lack enough trash receptacles in front of the building and near the back of
                        the cafeteria where the children play. Our sidewalks are cracked. Our basketball court is
                        ancient looking. Our school doors could use a fresh coat of paint.
          62            The community is friendly and the students really care about teachers and teacher care about          3/26/2023 4:52 PM
                        students. The importance of diversity of thought, expressions, and ideas are clear. However,
                        there are those who fear change to see a more diverse population are still apparent due to their
                        lack of exposure and knowledge. Parents will need more education on how to work with their
                        children successfully.

                        our learning environments are centered around the students we teach. The teachers also fight
                        to ensure teachers of BCPS are highly qualified to support all students, compensated
                        appropriately to retain excellent talent, and given a manageable workload to ensure our

         150            Our community is close-knit and very diverse. We have an airport, drive-in movie theatre, and        3/23/2023 3:27 PM
                        the National Guard. We are also close to the Bay.
         151            My school community has great parents who want to support the school. In addition, there are         3/23/2023 3:13 PM

         156            The Baltimore County Public Schools system as a whole is dedicated to continuously                   3/23/2023 1:57 PM
                        improving education for our students. Our teachers, school-based administrators, and
                        curriculum & instruction staff work hard to ensure our students' needs are met.
         157            I believe that a good superintendent is someone who already lives in the community and is not        3/23/2023 1:52 PM
                        someone who is brought in from outside of the community. This individual does not need to be
                        informed about the community because they are already aware of the good things and the bad
                        things.
         158            Our community is very interactive and offers a lot of opportunities to get to know our neighbors     3/23/2023 1:52 PM
                        and feel like a true community. It often feels like the small town just outside the city. There are
                        numerous community events and community traditions all throughout the year.
         159            Very diverse.                                                                                        3/23/2023 1:51 PM

         161            We have a very involved community, families, friends of families, volunteers who always want         3/23/2023 1:43 PM
                        to help us with anything, people who care about our learning environment.
         162            Parents care about the schools, and the students.                                                    3/23/2023 1:43 PM
         163            There is a close knit community school that are here for many needs of the students and              3/23/2023 1:43 PM
                        community. More schools should cater to the families and community to keep children out of
                        trouble during and out of school.
         164            Baltimore county residents have high standards for their children and our success oriented. As       3/23/2023 1:42 PM
                        for the pleasures of living in Maryland, we have four distinct seasons, each one with lovely
                        attributes. Most communities have pools to enjoy the summer heat or individual homes might
                        have their own pools. There’s lots of hiking nearby, including Appalachian trail and other
                        wonderful locations. Sailing enthusiasts have many locations to choose from. Most Baltimore
                        residents escape to the eastern shore over the summer to see the ocean. Skiing is available
                        just a short drive out at deep Creek Lake and north near the Pennsylvania border.
         165            I think those who want to be involved in the decisions for our students are involved and usually     3/23/2023 1:38 PM
                        involved in a very positive way. I think that we are proud of our community. I know that I would
                        never want to switch schools just because I am that committed to it and I think that others in
                        our community mirror this commitment level as well.

                        all the opportunities that children in richer areas have. We may not write letters or attend
                        meetings but want the same things that parents in higher income areas do and we do not
                        always get those things. We need experiences teachers in our schools with dedicated
                        leadership. Our schools often have teachers leaving every year. This is not right.

                        generations are lazy and abuse the system in every way possible. The students are out of

                        that issues far greater than learning loss from Covid are plaguing my community; crime,

                        present, and tomorrow.
          188           The benefit of a large school system is that there are lots of opportunities for staff and           3/23/2023 12:46 PM

                        that is solely on the shoulders of science teachers, or those in Facilities Mangement, this
                        needs to be a holistically tackled by the entire district and community and engrained in our
                        district's culture.
          197           The community is kept clean for the most part. Most of the community it friendly helpful              3/23/2023 8:52 AM
                        individuals. A nice place to live/visit. Tends to be more quiet. Good schools.
          198           I can only speak about PHHS but it is a very diverse school                                           3/23/2023 7:57 AM

          200           Everyone looks out for each other and supports each other. We need someone who will do the            3/23/2023 7:40 AM
                        same.
          201           very peaceful                                                                                         3/23/2023 3:54 AM

          203           We are resource rich from farm land to waterfront to suburban cities with wide variety of             3/22/2023 9:41 PM
                        industries that span all fields of the economy from agriculture to biomedical to game design.
                        People stay and return the Baltimore County to raise their families to build their futures.
          204           My community is focused on safety and appropriate civic behavior from all residents. My               3/22/2023 9:21 PM
                        community in Perry Hall values diversity and expects all residents to follow the law and be
                        respectful to others in public areas. Often we hear that there is lack of discipline and respect in
                        our local middle and high schools. this is the responsibility of the superintendent. Please hire
                        someone who expects all students to behave and have a plan for those that start trouble in
                        schools. My grandchildren will not attend BCPS schools because of the bad reputation of lack
                        of discipline and low support for the teachers.
          205           My community cares about our surroundings. My community cares about our kids receiving a              3/22/2023 8:36 PM

                         for each other. I love that Baltimore County is a diverse community. It makes our experiences
                         richer because we can learn from one another.
          216            Hard working people                                                                                   3/22/2023 2:04 PM
          217            Our students come from very diverse backgrounds and bring a wealth of knowledge and                   3/22/2023 1:56 PM
                         culture to Baltimore.
          218            There are many great things about the community. My hope would be that anyone interested in           3/22/2023 1:48 PM
                         working in this community would first be aware of all the great things going on.
          219            fix the broken schools.....violence..no learning....in theory every public school should be a safe    3/22/2023 1:30 PM
                         place to learn. lol.that is a joke

          221            The parents' involvement is strong and they tend to be supportive and we are able to work             3/22/2023 1:16 PM
                         collaboratively with them.
          222            We are close to a lot of great culture and history: Baltimore City, Washington DC, Philadelphia.      3/22/2023 1:10 PM
                         My kids have taken field trips to all of these places! The county has a great variety in it:
                         country and rural, suburban, and areas with a very urban feel. We have great diversity here.
                         My kids have met families from Africa, China, Afghanistan, Mexico, and more simply by going
                         to public schools. We are close to SO MANY colleges (Johns Hopkins, Towson University,
                         UMBC, Stevenson, Goucher, etc.) and have a great community college. If the new
                         superintendent has children who may be heading to college, there are many local choices as
                         well as opportunities for BCPS to partner with colleges for things. We have the Maryland State
                         Fairgrounds as a resource right here in the middle of our county!
          223            Our politicians are supporters of education. our community believes in public education, unlike       3/22/2023 12:39 PM
                         some other places around the nation. We won't try to dismantle public education. we are
                         centrally located and close to fantastic recreation opportunities, washington DC, Baltimore
                         City. We have something for everyone - recreation, waterfront, hiking, great restaurants and
                         cultural centers and theaters, convention centers and concert venues for large concerts. we
                         are diverse and fairly purple in terms of politics, making it a safe space in which all
                         superintendent candidates and their families would be welcome
          224            We have a very small, safe, and friendly neighborhood.                                                3/22/2023 12:27 PM

                         children but all of the children at BCPS schools.
          235            There are a lot of parents that want to be envolved in their child's academic career and              3/22/2023 8:51 AM
                         participate in the success of their neighborhood school. The educators within Baltimore County
                         are very gifted and caring. The better a school is in our area, the better that area is.

                        from their home schools, risk free from COVID-19. The virtual student representatives can 
                        learn in a non-toxic, safe, clean air environment in the virtual learning program. VLP learners

                        beverages when virtually online. Learners in the VLP can abide by CDC washing their hands 20 
                        second rule while singing the "Happy Birthday" song. Students, teachers and parents can 
                        focus on the alloted or allowed 8:45 a.m. to 3:10 p.m. learning timeframe. Parents can help

                        communities are the stepping stones we need to improve in order to take care of our 
                        community. VLP progress is clearly shown when student learners microphone is muted "off" so 
                        parents and students working at home are not distracted by background noises. Students can 
                        clearly understand their parents, caregivers, teachers, guidance counselor, Principal, Director, 
                        Superintendent, classmates and his or her role in the LIVE virtual program. Students can focus 
                        100 percent of attention span on learning while being filmed on a LIVE broadcast. Teachers 
                        can focus on lesson plans. Teachers lesson plans are created before class. The BCPS MCES 
                        VLP has gained more teaching time less bus, nurse, cafeteria, tardy, absentees, car ride or 
                        dismissal and cleanup duty time. VLP teachers are professionals who accept suggestions and 
                        recommendations from the community clearly in hopes for a brighter, better, stronger, more 
                        efficient and productive generation full of diversity, personality similarities or differences and

                        up to lead. Based on hiring outside of the BCPS community in the past and the, dare I call it
                        out, failures of those hires through similar national search agencies, it boggles my mind that
                        there isn’t one qualified candidate within the area. At least why not start by interviewing
                        potential candidates here in the area first?

                       Baltimore County public schools. We are forced to pay exorbitant private school fees because
                       we do not have the confidence to send our children to a public middle school (Pikesville Middle

                        student is middle of the road and I am told that in High School you are either with the gifted
                        and talented or with kids struggling and kind of given up on.. True?

         12             I've always appreciated the fact Baltimore County Public Schools (BCPS) offers many diverse         3/30/2023 11:38 AM
                        programs and opportunities for its students. Although BCPS is a large school system, they try
                        to meet the needs and interests of all students with their vast array of programming and
                        opportunities. And, as the parent of a special-needs student, we've been very pleased with the
                        individual care and attention our daughter has received from teachers and staff.
         13             Teachers remain for a long time; meets the needs of diverse learners.                               3/30/2023 6:52 AM

         17             While I have some school worksite experience, most of my employment history has been in             3/29/2023 2:40 PM
                        the Central Offices as a classified employee so again, my responses are through that lens.
                        Once again, whomever the next Superintendent is, that individual must have a vision for this
                        school system that incorporates decisions made utilizing an equity, racial, and social justice
                        lens to be transparent in how the system is coming across to its major stakeholders like the
                        employees, school communities, and elected officials.
         18             Sadly BCPS has lowered their standards                                                              3/29/2023 1:32 PM

          106            One of the biggest strengths of our schools is our educators. We have many principals,                3/24/2023 1:42 PM
                         administrators, teachers, counselors, and staff who grew up here in BCPS and returned to
                         teach, many are parents, and many have come from around the state and region to teach here.
                         We are dedicated to our youth. One big strength of our schools is our diversity. I have students
                         from a dozen countries sitting in one class, and even my American students come from many
                         cultural backgrounds, which is such a wonderful learning opportunity. We have great
                         extracurricular activities such as Model UN, engineering, our sports programs, and our arts,
                         which often partner with community organizations and institutions to give students real-world
                         access. We're also starting a historic community schools initiative that will bring a new model
                         of education to our Title 1 schools. Our TItle 1 elementary and middle schools are currently in
                         the first year of piloting.

          119           We need to get real about discipline. Students aren't held accountable for not only their grades      3/24/2023 7:16 AM
                        but also their behavior. We will lose a lot of teachers who are tired of seeing violence and are
                        tired of being cussed out. Fix the student discipline or find ways for violent offenders to take
                        their courses online--we know the online thing works.

         182            My daughter is only in kindergarten, but what I have observed is that the schools are very          3/23/2023 12:58 PM
                        diverse as well as they offer a variety of "extras" such as art, music, etc.

                       activities. The school leadership communicates fairly well.
         186           You have thousands of dedicated teachers and support staff who are dedicated to providing         3/23/2023 12:50 PM
                       quality educational, emotional, and social support to our students.

                       is apart of the community. The good things about the schools my children are zoned to attend
                       is that they offer more than just mandatory instruction-time as engagement for students and
                       families. Most of the teachers (not all) have adapted their pedagogy to incorporate race,
                       racism, and anti-white supremacist strategies. This is important in a school district where more
                       than 20% of the student body identifies as non-white racially and ethnically. The administrators
                       who have been in the community for 10+ years take seriously the concerns of all stakeholder
                       groups (students, parents, community residents, business owners, etc.) and try to create a
                       space (usually the school) as the common ground for us all.
         189           Schools are filled with passionate educators, administrators, and support staff.                  3/23/2023 12:46 PM

                       we can to support each other and our kids. We go above and beyond to meet academic and
                       social emotional needs. We are burning out, though, as the needs are growing exponentially
                       each year. Post-covid, students are less able to work independently or maintain the stamina to
                       complete assignments without individual support. We don't have enough support staff to meet
                       behavioral, social emotional and academic needs in the classroom.

         201           I feel like many teachers at this point have given up on actually teaching and counting the       3/23/2023 7:57 AM
                       days to the next break. But then there are others that are incredible, dynamic, engaged

         203           Everyone is always striving to do their best. Our students are always encouraged to be pushed     3/23/2023 7:40 AM
                       to reach their full potential.
         204           information dissemination is perfect                                                              3/23/2023 3:54 AM

                        communities, parents take responsibility for their children's academic success and behavior.
                        Other schools in other areas need to have more support for academic success and behavior.
         208            My school has a before and after care program which is helpful.                                      3/22/2023 8:36 PM

                        share those families values. We want to transition our culture and values to our middle school
                        (Pikesville Middle). However, we believe that majority of students and families of students that
                        send their children to Pikesville Middle do not share our values.

                         teachers doing amazing things to assist students in supporting them academically and

          278            Some schools are good and some not so good. This might be due to discipline issues due to               3/21/2023 1:36 PM
                         overcrowding as the county council keeps over building and does not allow the school facilities
                         to catch up with the amount of building. We are also near the city and many families lie about
                         where they live.

          325            I have twins, while one of the twins have no issues at her school (Chesapeake High School,            3/21/2023 8:12 AM
                         Essex) the other twin at Patapsco (Dundalk) are bullied daily by students and sometimes
                         teachers say very unprofessional, mean things to students. I think all teachers should take
                         mandatory mental health training because some of these students are seeing mental health
                         therapist, counselors and psychiatrist that they are not aware and because of HIPPA, they are
                         not required to disclose it. Often times, teachers say very mean and reckless things to
                         students.

                         and actions.
          329            The students excel because of the shared values of the community. The only thing that                 3/21/2023 8:01 AM
                         prevents the students' progress is the inept leadership and constantly changing curriculum and
                         goals.

          338            The school where I work has great teachers. They care about one another. The students who             3/21/2023 7:21 AM
                         want to learn are amazing for the things they overcome - internal and external.

                         communication; high parental engagement.
          340            I have taught at the best school in Baltimore County and one of the worst. At the magnet              3/21/2023 7:18 AM
                         school I'm currently at, our school does not tolerate bad behavior and students know there is a
                         consequence and that they could lose their seat. However, at other schools there are no
                         consequences and students are out of control. There needs to be tougher consequences on
                         violence, bullying, and disrespect. At the better schools I've worked at, the students want to
                         learn and the test scores are very high. There is no disrespect and parents fight to get their
                         kids here.
          341            For the most part the teaching staff is strong.                                                       3/21/2023 7:18 AM

         348            Teachers have been great. But they're leaving pretty quickly. 5th grader has only one former         3/21/2023 7:11 AM
                        teacher still at the school. Four have left.
         349            In the past we have had a very loyal staff. In recent years the turn over has been dramatic.         3/21/2023 6:59 AM
         350            Our schools have excellent reputations. Our high school has a strong graduation rate and             3/21/2023 6:48 AM
                        amazing extra curricular programs. Many of the students receive scholarships both academic
                        and sports.
         351            The VLP protects those who feel uncomfortable going back to in-person schooling. We are a            3/21/2023 6:39 AM
                        safe-haven. We have smaller classrooms. have the ability to work in a less distracted
                        atmosphere and one-on-one. It is a more personal experience.
         352            I believe the schools offer a good variety of classes and opportunities for career classes as        3/21/2023 6:30 AM
                        well as trade classes which are becoming more in demand. I also think the high schools need
                        to continue to add more "life skill" classes for the students. Such as basic financial and home
                        environment skills. Too many students leave the schools without an education of what reality
                        is to live an independent life. And I admandly believe that the trade school type classes need
                        to be part of the curriculum. Why were Home Economics, Auto Mechanics, and those types of
                        classes ever removed from our schools? Most students leaving high school do not even have
                        the basic knowledge how to balance their bank account, do their own laundry, buy groceries,
                        cook a meal, or even common courtesies in general.
         353            The magnet schools and programs are exceptional. The teachers are hard working and                   3/21/2023 6:17 AM
                        devoted to students.
         354            Catonsville High has students that are very successful in academics and sports. They have            3/21/2023 6:15 AM
                        much support at home.
         355            Our schools care about all children and strive everyday to meet the needs equitably. We              3/21/2023 6:12 AM
                        continue to add supports where needed to close learning gaps and find ways to support kids
                        regardless of their home situation. Our schools understand that we need to reduce our class
                        sizes and hire more highly trained special educators and mental health supports in order to
                        realistically meet the needs of all students. Safety is our biggest concern and our schools
                        understand we need to continue to find ways of setting boundaries and limits while also
                        providing supports to ensure a path to success for all students.
         356            Great and supportive teachers, look to support and give in the best interest for our students.       3/21/2023 6:06 AM

                        not have the same reputation. I have seen many families move away from our community to
                        avoid their children attending our middle and high schools. My children we lucky to be able to
                        get into magnet programs in high school. My son had to go to Golden Ring. There were many
                        issues of bullying, violence, profanity, and abuse from other students. My son's teachers were
                        wonderful for him and helped him make this transition as good as possible. Many of those
                        teachers have moved away, or quit because of the student and parent's behavior. The lack of
                        respect for the teachers is a deterent for maintaining the quality teachers our children deserve.

         426            The school is diversified with students with potentials and eager to thrive.                       3/20/2023 4:43 PM

         430            90% of the students are great There is NO accountability for the other 10% who are ruining         3/20/2023 4:37 PM

         433            Nice teachers, lots of clubs and extra curriculars. Some quality teachers who seem to be able      3/20/2023 4:32 PM
                        to bring a lot to the table.
         434            Well we do this wonderful thing were the schools in a poor area only get the taxes from the        3/20/2023 4:28 PM
                        area to help hold back poor people. The kids in the higher tax areas get more money so they
                        can stay ahead of the poor kids. You know kinda like segregation just with money.
         435            Caring teachers. Broad curriculum with a lot of choices.                                           3/20/2023 4:21 PM

                        and parents feel they are safe- in my experience school safety is not normally a parental
                        discussion topic.
         441            The schools try hard when it comes to 'normal' students. However the system falls far short of    3/20/2023 4:05 PM

                        fantastic.

                        School Coordinator, who solicits help from many community members and stakeholder groups.
                        The Coordinator puts all the puzzle pieces together in order for the whole program to run
                        smoothly.

                        who work really hard. Most school staff do whatever they can with what they have to support

         452            Overall good teachers and students.                                                               3/20/2023 3:47 PM
         453            Prior to the recent superintendent, our students were achieving and our schools had a positive    3/20/2023 3:44 PM
                        climate. The system overall had a positive culture prior to the current superintendent. BCPS
                        was on the cutting edge of academic programs.
         454            Our schools are blessed to have talented teachers and school-based administrators that            3/20/2023 3:44 PM

                        but very friendly
         457            I work at Rossville Elementary this is one of the best schools that I have been apart of.         3/20/2023 3:38 PM
                        Rossville is very organized and gives off a family feeling when you walk in the building.
         458            Our school works to challenge students but also offer support. The whole student is valued,       3/20/2023 3:38 PM
                        and students are taught empathy and respect for differences.
         459            I work at Catonsville Center for Alternative Studies. I am proud that we have embraced            3/20/2023 3:37 PM
                        relationship building and restorative practices. As a result, we help students who have
                        struggled at comprehensive schools to "rewrite their narrative." I am also excited that we will
                        be a community school for the westside in 2023-2024.
         460            Our school has excellent students and staff. Staff are focused on instruction and professional    3/20/2023 3:36 PM

         463            At this point i cant, the building i work in is awful. We use an LS grading system (which the     3/20/2023 3:25 PM
                        faculty is completely against), that has created a culture of apathetic students that do nothing,
                        and expect everything. There is no discipline at all and most of our veteran quality teachers
                        are leaving, including me. I plan on staying in the county only if we plan on bringing back some
                        kind of discipline.

                        appreciated and supported. Many staff feel uncertain about making decisions or taking a stand

                        makes all the difference in the world. Without that care, then the teaching lacks passion. It
                        would appear there is passion in both schools and that is good thing.

         2             BCPS is facing all of the same challenges that all school systems are facing coming out of the  4/1/2023 10:57 PM
                       pandemic--teacher shortage. Many people--parents included--are frustrated with the constant
                       struggle to meet even basic needs. There is a lack of transparency about what is really
                       happening and what is being done to address problems. Communication from the schools
                       (secondary, in particular) is very lacking.
         3             Shutting down of the schools during COVID has led to many issues with our students.             4/1/2023 3:47 PM
                       Academically, the students are way behind. There are a lot of behavioral, social, and emotional
                       issues with the students who were most affected by the pandemic. The student to teacher
                       ratio is terrible, as there are 20 or more students per teacher at our school. Therefore, the
                       teachers are not equipped to handle both the academic and behavioral issues. There's very
                       little support for these teachers. So, the teachers are overworked and stressed. Also, there's a
                       teacher shortage.
         4             VLP provides a much needed solution to a pandemic that predates (and was exacerbated by)        4/1/2023 2:19 PM
                       Covid shut downs. Suicide rates were too high before Covid and are now even higher. BCPS is
                       making strides in SEL, but only so much can be done when our children are afraid to go to a
                       brick and mortar school (for a number of reasons). BCPS could find a way to reallocate funding
                       in order to continue the VLP, such as SEL grant funding, for example.
         5             The system is struggling due to demographic shifts and unstable leadership                      4/1/2023 8:34 AM
         6             I have been in BCPS for decades and have worked closely with executive leadership under         3/31/2023 8:18 PM
                       several different administrations. This administration consists of multiple former principals from
                       Montgomery County 3 with no executive leadership experience - brought in by the current
                       Superintendent. Their lack of experience working at the central office level has caused a
                       multitude of problems. A decision takes a long time because it is bottlenecked between three
                       people who make all the decisions for BCPS 3 approval bodies no longer exist. Instead, three
                       people are micromanaging the 22nd-largest school system in the country. Staff is afraid to
                       speak; for example, during meetings, staff say very little because this administration has
                       ignored or reprimanded people for providing constructive criticism. It leads us to question the
                       purpose of having executive directors, directors, supervisors, etc., who are content experts
                       because they are scared to give feedback on an issue. We just do as we are told now. This
                       administration is toxic, and everyone is scared to do anything now. We used to be a team, but
                       everyone stays in their lane now, which does not help us address the many challenges we
                       face.

         15            As a parent, I believe the most pressing issues facing BCPS include focusing on increasing        3/30/2023 11:38 AM
                       student academic performance scores across all areas (not just in English language arts and
                       math); implementing initiatives to successfully address and reduce school violence; offering
                       support and services to students with mental health challenges; addressing the overcrowding
                       that exists in some schools; and strategizing ways and incentives to hire and retain teachers
                       and staff. Also, as the parent of a special-needs student, I would also like to see the next
                       BCPS superintendent continue to make sure the special education student population
                       continues to receive resources, attention, and support.
         16            BCPS cultural norms do not support change, productivity, or collaboration.                        3/30/2023 9:06 AM

                       from time to time. Have a mission for the school system. Deal with safety concerns.
         18            We are the second lowest performing school system in the state. Our graduation rate has           3/29/2023 10:33 PM
                       dropped. We have academic programs that are not helping our students. There are too many
                       pilots and field tests. No one ever hears why one was not selected and how they will help the
                       students who spent time on them. The chief of academics uses a lot of words strung together
                       but there is little action and questions answered. We need a clear focus, way of operating and
                       consistncy.
         19            Our resource teachers in elementary schools are not working to their full potential. My           3/29/2023 10:14 PM
                       workload as a classroom teacher is way beyond their workload. Long lunches, leave at
                       dismissal with no work to take home, and rarely in classrooms. Put more teachers in
                       classrooms and eliminate multiple resource positions in schools. I should not have 28 kids in
                       my first grade classroom and 5 resource teachers in my school all sitting around
                       testing/assessing one kid at a time. Useless. I know more about current trends in curriculum
                       because I teach it and live it all day. (Teacher in a bcps school)

         21            The incoming Superintendent should consider creating a career ladder for ALL classified           3/29/2023 2:40 PM
                       employees. Many are holding multiple degrees but are constantly overlooked for higher-level
                       positions. BCoPS is very TOP heavy with administrators 3 especially when compared to
                       several other larger MD school systems. All employment positions should be tied to student
                       achievement 3 regardless of job classification. BCoPS is relatively colonial in its thinking
                       about a number of education issues. The new Superintendent should be mindful of this and
                       have a system in place to deal with reluctance or any push-back to change for the better while
                       still utilizing an equity, racial, and social justice lens when making decisions. A good leader is
                       one who listens to the employees whose jobs fall at the BOTTOM of the hierarchy scale 3 not

                       well BCoPS employees are doing and determine better what the worksite
         22            Be aware that since BCPS changed their policy to allow kids to turn their work in whenever        3/29/2023 1:32 PM
                       they want the quality of education went down. Since BCPS doesn’t discipline kids (a kid
                       breaks a teachers nose they get 3 days of in school suspension- unacceptable the kid should
                       be kicked out) the quality of education went down. When BCPS bought computers, teachers
                       stopped doing interactive classes and just have the students sit on their computers all day, the
                                                                        45 / 125

                        quality of education went down. When BCPS said all kids can retake tests as many times as
                        they want, the quality of education went down. Leadership and communication at BCPS is
                        none existent. It doesn’t have to be this way. Have kids hand in assignments on time or get a
                        zero. Allow only 1x to take a test. Throw out the computers and hire more teachers who will
                        interact with their class. Disciple the students appropriately and the teachers will stay. BCPS
                        can do better and it starts with leadership.
         23             BCPS doesn't do a good job of keeping students enrolled in the school closest to their home.      3/29/2023 1:00 PM

         25             Honestly, we are tired of individuals who are looking to make a name for themselves and "build    3/29/2023 12:04 PM
                        their resume". We don't care about that. Please hire someone who cares about students as the
                        human beings they are. And cares about the quality of education, not how it looks on paper to
                        others. Our school system's priorities have been out of line since the Dance years and haven't
                        returned.

                        issues -- some are quite old and need updating/ replacement, including Towson High;
                        overcrowding; cafeterias are too small in some; safety concerns in some
         27             1. The standards of behavioral expectations and academic progress among students has
                                                                                                                          3/29/2023 8:59 AM
                        declined over time. BCPS should re-establish a culture of required behavioral expectations that
                        includes parent involvement and consequences when expectations are not followed. Currently,
                        many students have insufficient coping strategies for handling their emotions. BCPS should
                        increase its implementation of social/emotional skill development, but ALSO implement strict
                        consequences for student misconduct. 2. Expectations for student academic progress are low.
                        Students get promoted to the next grade level even when they are performing years below their
                        peers. 3. Class sizes in some cases are unmanageable. For example, some first grade
                        classrooms have 31 students including many with special needs.
         28             We need someone who is willing to make major changes in central office & district policies.       3/29/2023 8:20 AM
                        Our grading policy, attendance policy, and discipline policies are disasters and need a full
                        overhaul. Teachers are fleeing this district as soon as they can find other jobs--not because of
                        their school, but because of the district as a whole.
         29             Some behavior issues. Understaffed offices which leads to lags in support, teacher shortage,      3/29/2023 7:45 AM

                        held accountable for disruptive behavior. Therefore they are able to interfere with the education
                        of all other students. Our scores are down; we are experiencing brain drain in what used to be
                        our best schools because the county is afraid to set behavior standards.

         32             This county is large and extremely diverse in many ways. Historically, the county has had an      3/29/2023 6:58 AM
                        excellent school system, but in the last 10 years, the quality has suffered. The main 2
                        problems are poor curriculum and behavioral issues without appropriate consequences. Unless
                        these 2 issues are dealt with effectively and efficiently, the county will continue its downward
                        spiral.
         33             Teacher sincerity, quality and a passion for teaching. A genuine connection to the students and   3/29/2023 6:17 AM
                        families in their school is more important than the paycheck. With quality education our
                        communities are better.
         34             morale is at an all-time low from the schools to the central offices.                             3/28/2023 3:39 PM
         35             School system is large, maybe too large, and diverse. Student/family population is                3/28/2023 3:29 PM
                        increasingly poor with a growing English learner population. School budget is >50% of the
                        overall county budget. Academic outcomes have been on a downward slide ~10 years. There
                        is a disconnect between what central office says is being done in schools and what is actually
                        being done in schools. There is a lack of follow up and accountability. Special education
                        services are inadequate, and parents often have to hire advocates and lawyers to get system
                        to meet child's needs. Discipline practices are ineffective and inconsistent which is
                        contributing to students feeling schools are unsafe and teachers are feeling unable to teach in
                                                                         46 / 125

                        replacement, but projects are often held up in funding by politics. School system has done a
                        poor job at predicting school capacity and finding long term solutions to prevent overcrowding.

         37             The budget for B. County is >50% of county budget. We have too many administrators. There         3/28/2023 12:22 PM
                        is a disconnect between what central office administrators present as to what is currently
                        happening in the classroom. Safety while learning should be a priority. Reading comprehension
                        is much needed for improvement along the county.
         38             We (staff especially) need to feel connected to the superintendent. We want to get to know        3/28/2023 10:03 AM
                        you, see you beyond the photo opps, feel valued. People who are appreciated do more simply
                        because they feel valued. It costs nothing! Morale is low in almost every school, mostly
                        because of pressures from the top (even higher than the principals). We, staff, need the
                        confidence from above to do what is best for students, even if that means falling a day behind
                        in curriculum because we need to address social and emotional needs of our classes. There is
                        minimal connection between central office and school-based which creates a divide between
                        the 2. School based think central office do nothing or don't understand them (trust me, many
                        don't), and central office is so busy with meetings they barely get into schools. When they do
                        come out, it's a quick walk and out they go. Talk to us! Teachers will tell you. Having a
                        advisory board of teachers is a great idea but when those teachers are all friends with
                        executive leadership, it's not helpful. Teachers are also fearful of talking at board meetings. We
                        WILL get backlash from it. Can there be another way for us to supportively and kindly voice
                        our concerns and actually have them read and/or heard?

                        how long they have until retirement. Disconnect between top leaders and staff. The
                        superintendent's office worked hard; however, there is still so much chaos. Their lack of
                        organization or taking on too much responsibility through the reorg meant that things in our
                        office took way too long to get the go -ahead on projects with the result that the final work
                        product was rushed or time-frames were changed so much that you stop caring. Projects were
                        'dropped' by the supe's office last minute without context or explanation with an expectation
                        that they would just be done. There was rarely any follow up. Walk the walk. If you say we are
                        about kindness and connection, be that. We have three counties in one. The west side, the
                        central area, and the east side. There can be a lot of tension in the district about who gets
                        what. BCPS is having a hard time making the equity work take hold. The new ED is wonderful
                        and perfect for the job. The new supe will have to know how to move the work forward. Scores.
                        Behaviors in school and supporting staff and students. We want our schools to be safe places
                        for all. Finally, we have undergone so much change in the last 10 years. New supes come in
                        with their agenda and turn everything upside down. There have been many necessary and
                        great changes; however, we are all tired. The constant change means we are never settled and
                        never get really good at what we are doing.
         42             We need an active, transformational leader who will create school choice for parents and kids     3/28/2023 5:09 AM

         43             BCPS has had a multi-year decline in academic outcomes even though standards have been            3/27/2023 9:36 PM
                        lowered year after year. This is coupled with in increase in absence and violence in our
                        schools. Graduation rates are meaningless since many graduates can’t read.
         44             I am very concerned about overcrowding and student behavior. The school next door to my           3/27/2023 6:11 PM
                        house, pleasant plains, has 7 trailers on its property. I am also not considering sending my
                        child to this school because of recent test scores and parent ratings on social media.

                         seen so many kids bullying other children and the schools don't do much of making serious
                         consequences on both parents and students They also need to educate the teachers and the
                         principals as well. They need to stop looking the other way. Expelling the kids isn't always the
                         best repercussions. Actually giving them a better punishment for them is. I believe that the
                         child being bullied shouldn't be punished especially if they have made many attempts with
                         complaining about the bully.

          53             There is an inadequate level of diverse staffing at all schools. Principals are provided with            3/27/2023 10:49 AM
                         more power to hire and there is a disproportionate amount of diverse staff on the east side of
                         the county, not matching the demographic of the students. The diversity of staff is
                         concentrated in the West zone. The need for more schools to fit the growing population is
                         increasing. How is the superintendent prepared to meet this need? The salaries are always a
                         point of contention and there needs to be more done surrounding increases.
          54             In the middle and high schools, there are safety concerns that need to be addressed, regarding           3/27/2023 10:39 AM
                         physical altercations between students. We need more consequences for these types of
                         actions, so that the children and parents know that causing physical harm to others will not be
                         tolerated. Additionally, there are many elementary aged children who would benefit from more
                         advanced classes/opportunities in the areas of math and reading. Of course it is vital to help
                         the children who are behind in those areas, however the children who are advanced also

          58             Baltimore County is one of the larger Counties in the country. There is quite a diversity of our         3/27/2023 8:39 AM
                         students within the County. Parents generally enjoy being very involved in their children’s

                         Some "merging" pains did occur but these "pains" have diminished greatly and the Board is
                         dedicated to the students.

                        office team and the school buildings. This has caused some animosity that can be addressed
                        with improved communication processes. Right now, funding is at a high from grants, but there
                        is little collaboration with the different grant sources to discuss how to move forward together.
                        This can increase the opportunities by being more proactive and thoughtful in spending. We
                        have created a "yes" school system that has given too much power over to other entities and
                        will make it harder to start saying "no" when needed.
          66            Staff in higher positions do not listen to their employees. Teachers are not respected.               3/26/2023 10:47 PM
                        Decisions are made at the higher levels that affect the people like teachers that have to
                        implement programs without their input. Programs and curriculum are being constructed and
                        the teacher's feedback is not obtained on whether it is appropriateor even functional for the
                        students. Money isbeing wasted on jobs that don't help the teacher's in the schools. Related
                        service providers are not respected and not compensated for the level of education and
                        expertise that they have. Workloads are huge and unmanageable. Principals have too much
                        authority and there isn't input gathered from staff anymore for feedback on their administration.
                        Programs don't fit the students' needs. Alternative learning programs need to be brought back.
                        Staff that work in programs with students who have significant needs should be compensated
                        better with supplement pay. Speech language pathologists are nationally certified and state
                        licensed. They should receive a salary supplement just as teachers who have passed national
                        boards. Respect to the teachers and staff needs to be increased.

          69            Honestly? This school district is too large, and kids fall through the cracks. 110k students is a     3/26/2023 8:40 PM
                        bigger population than Gainesville, Florida. The transportation system can't support it (thought
                        it's WAY better than it was in the 2021-2022 school year). The distribution of resources is
                        disgraceful. There is no good reason that Lansdowne HS doesn't have a new building -- it's
                        wonderful that it's been approved for a replacement, but the current building is 60 years old and
                        kids can't drink from the water fountains. This is not conducive to learning. Teachers need
                        raises -- they do the most important work of our society -- providing students with an education
                        to prepare them for their futures AND *our* futures (because they will become our doctors, our
                        electricians, our researchers) -- and should be paid accordingly.
          70            No cohesion between curriculum offices for elementary level. So many schools with all                 3/26/2023 8:07 PM
                        individuals needs. Many teacher openings. Not enough special ed support or places to place

                        this effort are not skilled in this arena. I would bring outsiders into our schools for equity
                        training. Teachers are burdened and stressed out due to student behavior. Most of the time we
                        just have to grin and bear it. There is not much rigor in the ESOL curriculum. Just because
                        these kids come from foreign countries does not mean that they should receive less of an
                        education. There is bullying in the ranks of teachers that needs to be addressed. I feel that
                        especially as a teacher of color. I am not often included in my department. I see no room for
                        growth for my career.

                        needs of students due to 1) An outdated curriculum that is not culturally relevant. 2) A need for
                        more time to effectively collaborate with colleagues. 3) Scripted curricula that do not address
                        the learning styles of students. 4) A need for more resources.

                       racism. Many of the parents that you see on DEI committees, parents that help struggling
                       students, etc. are also the same parents that don't want more of "those kids" in their schools,
                       don't want "those kids" bringing behavior and academic issues into their schools, don't want
                       their communities re-districted into "bad" schools.

                       The curriculum and academic offices function as silos, under fear from their leaders, and that's
                       partly why we are a failing school system. There are too many pilots and field testing of
                       curriculum. No one is talking about the impact on students when one is not selected. There as
                       many compliance issues in Special Education Transportation is still a mess. Most of all there
                       is no feeling, belief, or unity across the system that we are in this together. some people are

                       schools. We need those options particularly in the western half of the county.

                       Regional special education programs are in need of support. There are not enough

                       Some teacher have left to teach in detention centers because they felt safer! The pandemic
                       made an impact on all schools;however, that is not an accuse for low performing schools.
                       BCPS has hardly and middle or high schools that rank high. How does BCPS prepare kids for
                       college if they don't have most of their schools ready for the challenge? Even though it was a
                       state decision, waiving requirements to fill empty positions is not appropriate when we are
                       talking about our future. Budget is another huge problem. Money is wasted yet we still don't
                       have air conditioning in all of the schools. The free breakfast and lunch next year is a complete
                       waste of money. People who can afford to provide food for their children should not get food for
                       free. That money could go for teacher salaries, educational resources, facilities improvements,
                       etc. Education and environment go hand and hand. The richest parents tend to be the loudest
                       because they have the means to do so. The school system needs to listen to ALL of us.

                                                                                                                         3/25/2023 1:30 PM
                       doing is not transferring into the classrooms or schoolhouses systemwide. Additionally, we
                       have a lot of great people with a huge amount of knowledge of where we are as a system with
                       effective strategies on how to get us there. Lean on them as they can help support the overall
                       mission and vision of the district! We need to pay our teachers for the work they are actually
                       doing. This includes providing quality planning and prep time for our teachers. Special
                       education needs a total revamp. Their <support= is anything but that.
         93            I feel that most people within bcps have no clue about special education and what's best for      3/25/2023 12:54 PM
                       special education children. I know that most kids in sped do not learn in a classroom of 20+
                       children. I feel that getting rid of adapted classrooms was a huge mistake for the success of
                       children in special education. The county could care less about what the paraeducators need
                       to be successful at their job, including proper technology.
         94            PHM School safety is a huge issue, overcrowding, students/teachers/administration are not         3/25/2023 12:51 PM
                       held accountable for their actions, lack of education/discipline, teachers who do not respect
                       different cultures/races, students do not respect authorities, constant
                       harassment/bullying/threats, constant disruptions in the classrooms
         95            BCPS is not the top performing school system it once was. Student academic performance
                                                                                                                         3/25/2023 12:33 PM
                       has continued to decline overall, many schools are overcrowded, teacher satisfaction is
                       concerning, and there has been a significant lack of communication and transparency
                       internally and to the public over the past several years.
                       Transportation (especially for special needs children outside their home schools) is absolutely 
         96
                                                                                                                         3/25/2023 11:59 AM
                       abysmal & it is unacceptable that children may be on the buses for up to 2 (or more) hours. 
                       Transportation team is also unresponsive to any concerns citing lack of staffing for any issue 
                       brought to their attention. Any superintendent should have capable leaders on staff who are 
                       willing to accept complete responsibility for their roles (instead of justifying/excusing 
                       themselves from any issues that come up to their attention). Transportation under 
                       ____________________is unacceptable & status quo should not be pursued.

         98            mental health & school safety: mental health issues in our schools are consistently brushed       3/25/2023 10:51 AM
                       under the rug by our individual school administrators; our superintendent needs to be able to be
                       aware of these issues and how they directly translate to school safety problems as well
         99            They need to understand that public education has become a joke. The standards are now            3/25/2023 10:42 AM
                       miserably low. It’s embarrassing to be a part of it, honestly. You can’t meet the bare minimum
                                                                        51 / 125

                        requirements to get a diploma? No problem, we’ll dumb it down as much as necessary. You
                        still can’t do that? No problem. We’ll spoon feed & practically hold your pencil in your hand to
                        complete a project to push you through. It used to be that even if you struggled academically,
                        schools could help make you a better human. Not anymore because they can no longer teach
                        morals, character, or grit. And there are no consequences for poor behavior anymore. Kids are
                        allowed to do whatever they want at the expense of others’ safety, comfort, and learning. It’s
                        one thing if you want to disrupt your own learning, significantly poor judgement, but okay. It’s
                        entirely something else when you’re interrupting the learning of others. This is a big reason why
                        so many teachers are leaving the profession. It’s never about the children. It’s about the lack
                        of consequences, the overbearing workload, the low pay for years of education & training, and
                        the incompetent administrators having to meet state quotas instead of meeting student needs.
                        This is just a few concerns.
         100            BCPS should have a superintendent that values, welcomes, and celebrates diversity. The               3/25/2023 10:08 AM
                        superintendent should have a concrete plan to continue the "equity" work that was started in
                        order to ensure that students have equitable access to learning.
         101            The accountability for behavior problems has become a huge issue in the schools. There are           3/25/2023 9:17 AM
                        no repercussions for cheating, cutting class, or being disruptive in the classroom. This has
                        made it difficult for teachers to do what they do best. This is causing a large exodus of
                        qualified teachers (myself included) who have left in search of jobs with more respect and
                        better pay.
         102            Crime and criminal behaviors are on the rise; our children are part of this behavior.                3/25/2023 9:13 AM
         103            The system is too rigid, too top down. Teachers need greater voice and flexibility                   3/25/2023 8:38 AM
         104            Communication approaches are still not as seemless and clear from schools to parents as it           3/25/2023 6:12 AM
                        could be. Also students need curriculums that support transition to real life.. like financial
                        literacy and navigation of the job hunt , resume writing, mock interviews how to dress and
                        approach. Seeing and what schools are sending to the workforce indicates a HUGE disconnect
                        in preparedness for next steps aside from college only.

                        teachers
         106            BCPS is a good system, they have many dedicated teachers, and staff but they also have               3/25/2023 12:10 AM
                        some people who need to be removed because they are incompetent! I want a Super who is
                        not willing to pass kids just because. I want a Super who wants to have graduates who can
                        read at grade level. I want a Super who is not tolerant of the increased violence in our schools.
                        I want a Super who wants to tackle the tough issues and not duck and cover when a tv camera
                        comes around. I want a Super who loves our students, faculty, and staff, more than they love
                        the mirror. I want a Super who will speak about the problems, the violence, the low test scores,
                        and the low respect for our teachers, which a voice and purpose that something is going to be
                        done and not just give another speech! I am tired of students being ignored, and excuses
                        made for their failures. If we are truly talking about educating our kids then let's stop passing
                        them when they cannot perform at grade level. Let's stop pushing them out the door and
                        sending them to the community college, where we are destroying their college future BEFORE
                        they graduate high school. Pay for teachers at the top has got to increase...the money is
                        frontloaded to recruit but there is NO incentive to retain experience and promote loyalty.
                        Retention of experienced teachers must be a priority and they must stop being looked at as a
                        problem. Many millennial-aged teachers need mentors...when things get tough, they are
                        looking to leave and you will have an issue because they will start looking to leave within 5
                        years of being hired, especially when they figure out that the changes to the retirement plan
                        will hurt them in the long run!
         107            Common core program doesn’t work to make kids proficient in math Overcrowded classrooms              3/24/2023 8:12 PM
         108            Large district, disparity between schools because of funding, economic conditions and racial         3/24/2023 7:52 PM
                        make up
         109            There are only five schools in all BCPS that have uniforms. Why are all the schools that are         3/24/2023 6:37 PM
                        predominantly schools with black students the ones in uniform? The schools with
                        predominately white students have a choice but the other students do not have a choice. This
                        is not equity at all.
         110            The school district is in need of a comprehensive revitalization and over haul in almost every       3/24/2023 6:10 PM

                        education through a vetted process. Please look to well performing school districts and
                        educational leaders and educators for beneficial input. Curriculum should be teacher and
                        student friendly as well as engaging and rigorous. Teachers need to be given respect and
                        treated as the professionals they are. The job of teaching is more difficult than ever and
                        students need qualified teachers who are fairly compensated for the demands of the job.
                        Teachers need more autonomy in the classroom to make decisions and more supports should
                        be in place for students that have learning/behavior difficulties. The school calendar needs to
                        be revised and the hours need to be examined for the elementary school day which is currently
                        beyond the required amount.
         111            The school system is in disarray. The curriculum is sub par and needs to be written by experts    3/24/2023 6:10 PM
                        and consistent throughout the schools so it is teacher and student friendly. Teachers need to
                        be treated as professionals and respected. BCPS offices need to be reworked to run more
                        efficiently especially HR and Certification so that they can handle the amount of employees.
                        Policies need to be revamped like the EAMP attendance policy given the post pandemic
                        stress and mental health issues plaguing many educators and staff members. The school
                        calendar needs to be reworked and done in an efficient manner like other nearby counties. The
                        elementary school day is unnecessarily longer and the extra 15 minutes should only apply to
                        the high school day. The calendar is too choppy and doesn't reflect best practices. Additional
                        duties/tasks are constantly being added to teachers' plates with little to no recognition.
                        Teachers should have adequate planning time and autonomy over their schedules and
                        instructional program and not be micromanaged. A decisive plan for managing behaviors
                        should also be considered.

                        community input and involvement. 3. Publish online (for all to see) the entire curricula for every
                        grade level and subject. 4. Keep politics and politicians out of decision making. No more Woke
                        policies, No CRT, No indoctrinating little children about gender and sex education topics
                        inappropriate for their age. 5. Enforce discipline. Disruptive behavior must have consequences.
                        Schools should not be stigmatized by the number of students suspended or expelled. Instead
                        they should be supported with extra resources to ensure the safety and well being of students
                        and staff. There is a need for more alternative schools and E- Learning) programs for disruptive
                        students. Often disruptive students have lower reading levels and should have remediation. 6.
                        Bring back paper textbooks. Not all students perform well with E books. Students must be
                        given the choice to learn with a paper textbook (in their hands) or an E book on a computer
                        screen. As a former online instructor I found, when asked, that 80% of my high students
                        preferred a paper textbook.
          121           1) I have not seen much transparency from the current admin. The super should have an
                                                                                                                             3/24/2023 1:52 PM
                        "Extreme Ownership" mindset and be upfront about what is currently there and take action. 2)
                        Be lean. There is perception/reality that the current administration is too bloated. We've had
                        two supers come and go. Have we really understood the programs they've put in place and the
                        value every new position created? There is still a lot of fluffy shiny stuff coming from the
                        office, that perhaps could be better spent with teachers on the ground. 3) Give control and
                        ownership back to the students, teachers, and community. Our county is not only large--but it
                        is really spread out. Let's have centralized driven directives kill our community involvement
                        and spirit.
          122           1) Retention crisis - since the start of the pandemic, BCPS has struggled to retain its amazing
                                                                                                                             3/24/2023 1:42 PM
                        educators. Teachers do not feel the pay in commensurate with the working conditions,
                        especially as student mental health needs, legal paperwork requirements, and other issues
                        continue to burden our already-short planning time. Please look at the number of resignations
                        and retirements of from the BoE over the last year. Teachers need a champion in a
                        superintendent who will go above and beyond to make sure educator compensation and
                        working conditions are a top priority, because this is the most important issue affecting
                        whether our children are safe and learning. Paraeducators are also paid pitifully and barely
                        make a subsistence wage. They need a living wage and proactive support to advance their
                        careers. This crisis most acutely affects our educators of color, and evidence shows that
                        recruiting and retaining quality educators of color is essential for students of colors' success.
                        2) Central Office inefficiencies - too many six-figure salaries and not enough people doing the
                        work, and inefficient and antiquated systems hinder hard-working employees. Please look up
                        and read the BCPS efficiency report published last year that outlined some major costly
                        inefficiencies in HR, payroll, certification, and other central offices. BCPS faced a ransomware
                        attack in Nov 2020, when all schooling was online, and continues to blame ongoing issues on
                        that, but that's not the only problem. Staff continue to be paid the wrong amount, sometimes
                        for years, or have to send in a transcript multiple times, or don't realize they're not in the salary
                        lane they should be - it's a widespread failure that has left educators and staff feeling
                        disrespected and like their work isn't important. A massive overhaul of our basic administrative
                        systems is necessary. 3) Corruption - this county, school system, and previous
                        superintendents have a history of taking kickbacks, double dipping, and using their positions to
                        benefit their pet projects and pocketbooks (see: Dallas Dance). This has created mistrust in
                        BCPS administration that has not abated. Many employees feel cynical about whether our
                        leadership is actually looking out for us and the kids at all. There's a lot of sugar-coating our
                        problems without the bold vision and execution needed to solve them. While a lot of teachers
                        are excited about their schools and about our students, almost nobody I know is championing
                        "team BCPS," because we don't feel that BCPS has our back. We have a lot to offer and we
                        want to help! Please let us help. 4. Lack of transparency - the superintendent's budget is
                        concocted in back-rooms without meaningful input from the community or any of the bargaining
                        units that represent the employees. It's also not released in full by line-item, even to the
                        presidents of the bargaining units. This means that we, the people most affected, are in the
                        dark about basic calculations that affect our classrooms, including what extraneous costs
                        could be foregone. This furthers people's cynicism and mistrust of their employer. 5) Inequity -
                        Balt. Co is very racially and socio-economically diverse and, like in many districts, our
                                                                           54 / 125

                        wealthier whiter communities continue to be more likely to get the resources their children
                        need. In particular, we have thousands of English language learners and are currently
                        overhauling our ESOL model (I teach ESOL students). We need significant support to integrate
                        our immigrant students into our school communities and make sure they have the resources -
                        physical, linguistic, emotional - to succeed. Teachers need to be prepared to ALL become
                        ESOL teachers, because we will all teach ESOL students. Schools with a large population of
                        ELs see their test scores drop - that's going to happen, because those tests were not created
                        for ELs but they're still forced to take them. Our new superintendent needs to understand this
                        challenge and invest in these students and their schools, not see them as a burden or barrier.
         123            These scores are terrible!                                                                        3/24/2023 1:03 PM
         124            Lochraven Middle School need more staff and increase in pay for the teachers and staff that's     3/24/2023 12:48 PM
                        working in the school building that deal with the children on a daily base
         125            We have seen more and more concerning content and personal preferences/opinions making            3/24/2023 12:07 PM
                        their way into the class room while actually teaching of math, science and English seem to be
                        sorely lacking.
         126            People are still dealing with the after effects of COVID-19. People are short-tempered, angry,    3/24/2023 11:42 AM
                        and feeling unheard. Any decision you make is going to anger someone. So be prepared.

         128            1) Dilapidated facilities. Some school buildings have been allowed to fall into disrepair by a    3/24/2023 9:57 AM
                        series of County Executives who have "kicked the can down the road" where building and
                        grounds issues are concerned. Some of those issues are being dealt with now, but will require
                        a very long time before fruition; 2) Overcrowding. Too many schools are overcrowded because
                        the County allows development without concern about the inpact on infrastructure. Additionally,
                        BCPS standards for predicting future enrollment (birthrate plus new construction) are woefully
                        inadequate. Planners need to take into account existing neighborhoods where residents are
                        aging up and out, with homes being sold to younger adults with current and future school
                        children; 3) Diversity and balance. Baltimore County is geographically and ethnically diverse.
                        As someone who grew up in Baltimore City, I understand and appreciate what the diversity of
                        the school population did for my future endeavors; 4) Achievement. Efforts must be made to
                        improve achievement at all levels, especially among marginalized groups. Professional
                        development must emphasize identifying students who, with a little boost, can achieve on a
                        higher level. Magnet program admissions must be structured to promote achievement by
                        minority students and create diversity in the schools that host those programs.
         129            Secondary schools need to offer more challenging courses to pre pare students in areas such       3/24/2023 9:42 AM
                        as information science. Seniors should have a schedule of engaging and college and career
                        ready classes instead of being encouraged to take only credits they need and then to leave
                        school for the rest of the day. The CCBC partnership needs strengthening and expansion.
         130            There needs to be an emphasis on reading, writing math and science. My child has a teacher        3/24/2023 9:19 AM
                        who asks questions about sexual orientation. <-THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE. My child has
                        teachers who display social flags representing their sexual orientation. <- THIS IS
                        UNACCEPTABLE. The only flags that should be displayed in school are the American flag,
                        State Flag and the flag of a country where a foreign language is being taught. Teachers need to
                        leave their preferences and political ideology at home. To be inclusive ,neutrality must be
                        practiced in public school.
         131            Leaders that are not invested in the community schools. Out of district students.                 3/24/2023 9:10 AM
         132            The parents are sick and tired of not being heard. BCPS students are just that students, they     3/24/2023 8:25 AM
                        are our children and as parents we are tired of having a say in our children's education. BCPS
                        is over stepping with what lessons should take place in our educational system and what
                        lessons should take place at home with their parents.
         133            There is a difference between urban and rural. We move to our communities to have our             3/24/2023 7:35 AM
                        children live a certain life that we feel will foster them as our future generation of leaders.
                        BCPS needs to not focus on our low performing 20%. We should be focusing on our high
                        performing students and growing our middle performing students to high performing. We should
                        not have large redistricting that hurts communities. We need to focus on more than our
                        majorities, we need to focus on our minorities as well. They need to understand that if we don't
                        make changes the private schools will continue to grab our students. We need BCPS to split
                                                                         55 / 125

                        into smaller sub-districts. We need to spend our money on new buildings, to reduce
                        overcrowding and programs, not consultants.
          134           The diverse staff and students in BCPS and the challenges they face.                                 3/24/2023 7:22 AM
          135           Behaviors and lack of consequences is running our schools. Kids know there are no                    3/24/2023 7:20 AM
                        consequences. It is a very poor environment for learning life skills.
          136           We need to get real about discipline. Students aren't held accountable for not only their grades     3/24/2023 7:16 AM
                        but also their behavior. We will lose a lot of teachers who are tired of seeing violence and are
                        tired of being cussed out. Fix the student discipline or find ways for violent offenders to take
                        their courses online--we know the online thing works.
          137           Diverse opinions, appearance of politics above doing what is right,                                  3/24/2023 7:02 AM
          138           There are many difficulties with the supports for staff in central office. Certification, payroll,   3/24/2023 6:59 AM
                        and benefits offices do not function in an efficient manner and there is far too much time spent
                        fighting individual issues for systemic problems. Communication is poor and inconsistent.
                        There are people in roles within central office that lack the decision making power their role
                        requires.
          139           Lack of funding                                                                                      3/24/2023 6:26 AM
          140           Classrooms are overcrowded. There are not enough adult assistants and paraeducators. There           3/24/2023 6:24 AM
                        is truly no ELA curriculum. Yet, BCPS continues to keep upper administration who take big
                        salaries and do nothing. There are no substitutes.
          141           This system disarray. It will require care, passion, and the ability to listen to understand. Top    3/24/2023 5:45 AM
                        down leadership has created a culture of fear and distrust which has led to a lack of
                        transparency and the inability to grow and adapt. This is a large district with varying
                        demographics and needs depending on geography. It will take skill, clear communication, and
                        an understanding of our communities, their short and long term histories and actions that make
                        sense for our school houses
          142           Violence, lack of accountability for student behavior, lack of learning, disabled children in gen    3/24/2023 5:18 AM

          143           All the different offices and departments don't flow and work as one. There is a breakdown in        3/23/2023 10:49 PM
                        communication between different offices especially when getting a real person on the phone is
                        so difficult. I work in a department where I am the one answering all the phone calls into our
                        office and so many times I have people say thank goodness a real person or wow someone
                        actually picks up the phone. With a county this large and heavy workloads across all
                        departments this is ends up delaying the workflow.

          145           I’m concerned about the lack of resources and support for students who exhibit some form of          3/23/2023 8:18 PM
                        test-taking anxiety. I wish the county would institute some sort of study halls/ test taking
                        strategy development courses for students STARTING in grade school.
          146           Teachers are tired of not being treated as experts in their field. There are too many chiefs who     3/23/2023 8:14 PM
                        are out of touch with what goes on in the classroom. Also, there needs to be a 180 degree turn
                        around in accountability for students and parents.

                        aggressive behavior from unruly students. Why should well behaved children have to be
                        subjected to the few that cause uncomfortable and unsafe environments? Doesn’t every
                        student have a right to be safe and learn in a positive classroom? Another problem, cell

                        accessible through the schoolhouse. The superintendent should know that there are many
                        inequities within our county that can be supported by providing more training to staff, better
                        and consistent communications, and as much funding as possible to support individual

                        struggle and frustration, self-regulate, and to develop an age-appropriate attention span. As a
                        result, students are showing increases in behavior and learning problems. Additionally, poor
                        nutrition education of families has resulted in poor nutrition of our students. This issue is also
                        causing learning problems in our students.
          168           One issue a candidate should be aware of is curriculum. Our curriculum is hard to keep pace           3/23/2023 3:27 PM
                        with. For example, science has too many lessons and the lessons we do have taken way
                        longer than 30 minutes. It is just hard to keep pace with.
          169           Buildings are understaffed. Teachers do not get the respect they deserve from the central             3/23/2023 3:13 PM
                        offices. More and more work demands are thrown at them without their input. Data is collected
                        and then fudged to meet whatever target BCPS wants. Central offices are unresponsive to
                        email and smart sheets. People are still working from home when buildings need them in their
                        offices. Kelly Services cannot fill the substitute needs. The extra 15 minutes of planning for
                        teachers is a disaster because the schedule does not allow for the 15 minutes to be attached
                        to specials or lunch without using IA essential instructional support. To top it off, IA support
                        has reduced for academic year 2023-2024. Moral is low. BCPS is a culture of fear.

                        services is exponentially increasing. Not everyone is appropriate for General Education,
                        especially when Classroom Teachers aren’t mandated to be trained in Autism and or various
                        disabilities. It is an extreme disservice to the SPED & GenEd students as well as all Faculty.

          171           Fighting that teachers just stand and watch so they dont get hurt. If the school has a no phone       3/23/2023 2:48 PM
                        policy, why do more than half the teachers allow it? So much bullying in the schools , the
                        principles even say we aren't worried about that anymore. 㴡
          172           Everyone is important. City but small town vibe, many old families with deep roots, extremes          3/23/2023 2:15 PM
                        on the socio-economic continuum, multicultural, accepting,
          173           There are not enough teachers from historically underrepresented/discriminated against                3/23/2023 2:14 PM
                        groups. Students are bullied based on identity factors and some (many?) teachers do not
                        appear willing or equipped to address this (administrators too). Students are not exposed to
                        enough diverse perspectives in their curriculum.
          174           Overcrowding, behavior issues, lack of support for the teachers, irresponsible spending of            3/23/2023 2:07 PM
                        school funds.
          175           One item of which the new superintendent should be aware is the divisive way in which our             3/23/2023 1:57 PM
                        Board of Education has conducted business over the past several years. Although this does
                        seem to be improving, there remains a need to guide the board into cooperative, and therefore
                        effective, decision making.
          176           The superintendent should be aware that there are principals in the county who clearly are only       3/23/2023 1:52 PM
                        doing the job to collect a paycheck. There is no communication between the administration
                        and staff. Constantly causing a problem of some sort in order to cause drama instead of being
                        a leader of the school. The superintendent should be aware of the lack of leadership in the
                        school buildings. An unannounced visit to a school will show the true colors of a principal
                        instead of telling them ahead of time.
          177           I do feel there has been an over emphasis on politically divisive subjects in the last few years      3/23/2023 1:52 PM
                        making their way into the curriculum at a young age. Our principal changed the annual
                        "Halloween parade" to "Fall spirit parade" with instructions that the kids should wear costumes
                        that reflect educational things like book characters. There was a lot of anxiety around this for
                        the parents when we didn't know if our 1st grader's costume would be approved because it
                        wasn't a book characters. Our community is very diverse and I think the better way to
                        celebrate diversity is to make everyone feel welcome in school rather than trying to shove
                        certain topics down people's throats. My six year old doesn't need to be learning about gender
                        identity in specific school sponsored curriculum. He needs to be learning how to spell and
                        write. Especially at the elementary school age, I think these well meaning programs and
                        political correctness end up creating greater divides and discomforts in the community. Let
                        kids be kids and let kids learn rather than trying to teach them value sets. Many of our best
                        teachers have quit teaching the last two years because of the excess administrative politics
                        being forced into the curriculum.

                         board. Real leader ship looks like a true understanding of each stakeholder’s primary interests,
                         and putting the education of our students first. Baltimore County parents desire schools, that
                         rank highest in our state if not our nation.
          184            Lack of discipline/consequences and violence within schools. Although we have some                       3/23/2023 1:38 PM
                         amazing students, we do have some that act out in very violent ways. I think that the new
                         superintendent should be aware that because of this uptick in violence and lack of
                         discipline/consequences(due to administrators being limited to how many students they can
                         suspend or what consequences they are allowed to give), many people are upset. At first it
                         was just teachers, but now parents are voicing their opinions and worry. I also have students
                         who have candidly expressed how they are afraid to come to school each day and I am at a
                         very good school. I also think the new superintendent should be aware that attendance is a
                         huge issue in our schools. I believe that if students needed to attend school or be at risk of
                         failing if they don't attend school regularly, we would have much better attendance and more
                         students who are truly learning. We allowed attendance policies to be a thing of the past, but it
                         has been a huge detriment to our students. They are not going into the real world with a
                         realistic idea of what will be acceptable when going into the workforce or college. The final part
                         is cell phone use. Sometimes it feels like I'm standing in front of those black squares on
                         google meets again because the students don't look up from their phones. When teachers are
                         not supported by technology misuse in their classrooms, it prohibits teaching and learning. We
                         give up and don't try to change this behavior. The new superintendent needs to see that these
                         small little computers are keeping our future generations from learning academic skills and
                         also social skills. Many of our students do not know how to interact socially because of the
                         phones, mostly the social media on phones. I believe that once there is a discipline policy,
                         attendance policy, and technology policy that is universal across these county, we will see
                         more balance between schools, teachers, students, parents, administrators, supervisors, and
                         community. I think there will be less angst between all of these groups and we can exist as
                         one.

          187            There is a dearth of qualified, culturally aware teachers and subs in the county. Our children's         3/23/2023 1:28 PM
                         educational needs are being negatively impacted by this. Since the pandemic shut down
                         schools for a period, students academic and social emotional learning has been on the decline.
                         There has not been enough discussion and more importantly, a shared plan of action to "right
                         the ship" in these areas.
          188            They should be aware that the pandemic severely delayed the progress of many students and                3/23/2023 1:21 PM
                         we are in a state of catching up. Multiple approaches to issues may be needed to cater to all

          189            Overcrowding. Overly onerous county-wide mandates. Demoralized teachers. Special needs                   3/23/2023 1:17 PM
                         services are being monopolized by kids with behavioral issues. Unacceptable cuts in gifted
                         programming. School administrators at the district level are unaccountable and, quite likely,
                         unqualified.

         191            Our board of education is a challenge to deal with. Our schools are aging and many of our         3/23/2023 1:16 PM
                        schools are overcrowded. Our parents do not trust the principals, superintendent, or the staff in
                        the offices. We have a shortage of teachers, bus drivers, cafe staff, additional adult staff and
                        especially substitutes. Our teachers are not allowed to correct disruptive student behavior.
                        They are told that their lessons are not engaging. Our students have become more and more
                        disruptive in our classrooms, due to the lack of support from the administration. Principals
                        blame teachers or state policy, and everyone pretends that there is no problem. This goes all
                        the way down to PK. In the meantime, teachers are suffering from burnout just trying to teach
                        the other students. On another note, we are constantly changing our textbooks or curriculum.
         192            The superintendent needs to be aware of what is actually going on in the schools. There is a      3/23/2023 1:16 PM
                        big disconnect between leaders who have not been in a classroom in years as they are not
                        understanding of the current needs of our students.
         193            Transparency of school is important. And also timely information is the key. The information      3/23/2023 1:14 PM
                        for everything shouldn’t be relay at the last minute so that the parents don’t have time to do
                        the research about topic or event.

         197            The grading system is a disaster. Being given a 50% for doing nothing sets kids up for future     3/23/2023 1:07 PM
                        failure. Students should be graded based on what they do and how they do it. If they put little
                        or no effort into the work, then they should be held accountable for that. Same with
                        attendance. If students do not attend school, they should not be passing, regardless of
                        whether they have access to the content online at home or through Schoology. The concept of
                        what is considered major or minor is ridiculous and nearly impossible for families, students,
                        and even teachers to carefully articulate, not to mention how that looks different across
                        schools and grade levels. Participation, attendance, all of that should be a part of the grade or
                        there is no motivation. Kids are extrinsically motivated, whether we like it or not. Return to the
                        standard categories (CW, HW, assessments) - those are clear and hold students accountable
                        for work in the classroom and at home. STOP trying to standardize everything. BCPS claims
                        they are huge supporters of equity, diversity, and differentiation, but then they hand us canned
                        curriculum with every teacher being expected to teach the same thing in the same way using
                        the same common assessments. This does NOT allow for student choice or differentiation to
                        meet student needs. BCPS is notorious for espousing certain beliefs but not supporting those
                        beliefs through practical application of policies and implementation. Student behavior is
                        atrocious, not all students, but the ones whose behavior is poor is so egregious that it is
                        harming the learning of other students. It is not right that a small number of students are
                        permitted to disrupt the classroom and the teachers continuously without being removed. Sure,
                        I can support the use of de-escalation strategies, conscious discipline, and restorative
                        practices, but at some point consequences need to go along with those things because
                        consequences seem to be the only motivators for changing behavior. The schoolhouse is not
                        equipped to provide the psychological, social, emotional, and behavioral services that some
                        students need, so all students suffer from the behaviors of a few. Teachers cannot teach and
                        students cannot learn when a significant amount of time is spent addressing disruptive student
                        behaviors, particularly repetitive ones. When are we going to start focusing on the large
                        majority of students who are there to learn and stop catering to the minority of students
                        demonstrating bad judgment, bad decision-making, and bad behaviors? It is not surprising that
                        test scores and achievement scores have dropped. We need to STOP using the pandemic as
                        an excuse. We have now been back in school buildings for almost two full years. Teacher and
                        staff retention. If you want to keep teachers, you better start doing something about the
                        complete disorganization and incompetence in the HR and related departments. Why don't we
                        have systems in place that make clear what activities people are paid for, what actual step
                        they are on, what actual credits they have, etc.? Yes, I now we lost data int he cyber attack,
                        but why hasn't anyone gone around to schools and talked to employees. Many people have
                        saved data that could help restore the details needed to make our employment records
                        accurate. People have downloaded growth charts with accurate credit earnings and salary lane
                                                                         60 / 125

                       information, etc. Why isn't there some systematic way that these issues are being addressed,
                       and if there is one, why isn't it shared with us so that we can at least recognize that something
                       is being done. Opening up a customer service line is no better than trying to call a specific
                       office because no actual solutions are given. And please stop with the new initiatives. LET US

                       student learning. It just means less time I can spend on planning, learning my content,

                       quitting for many reasons, but one of the biggest is behavior issues. Respect for teachers is
                       minimal. We are cussed at and threatened. Our instructions are ignored. We receive no
                       backup. I understand that we are reluctant to to suspend students because they belong in the
                       classroom. The data does not lie. But what we are doing is not working. Students refuse to
                       come to detention and the parents don't care. What are the consequences for that? What are
                       we supposed to do? Problem getting subs. Cafeteria food really is disgusting. Tech issues;
                       students without devices or devices that don't work. It really hinders the progress in the
                       classroom as many of our programs are software based. Hire more school counselors!

                       dramatically different. Title one schools should never have more than 10 % staff as non
                       tenured. Our title one elementary schools and feeder schools have over 50-80 % non tenured
                       staff and this impedes progress.
         202           Discipline is key. We do a disservice to not hold them accountable.                               3/23/2023 1:00 PM

                       students. The problem kids get all of the attention and resources. There is no equity if the

         206           Schools have had an increase in violence. Students seem apathetic about learning. Many            3/23/2023 12:51 PM
                       parents do not understand how to advocate for their students learning needs. They also do not
                       take responsibility for their students learning. Students are not showing academic growth and
                       seemed to be rushed through curriculum.
         207           During the past ten years I have been an educator, I have seen BCPS do a terrible disservice      3/23/2023 12:50 PM
                       to our students and staff by eliminating attendance rules, failing to appropriately discipline
                       students, and not holding kids academically accountable (kids get a 50% on assignments they
                       barely try on, due dates are no longer a thing, and all responsibility has been taken off of
                       students and parents for student behavior and achievement. It is almost impossible for a
                       student to get expelled or disciplined. If a student is African American it makes it doubly hard
                       to hold them accountable. I am a liberal. I support equity. However, it is my belief that the rules
                       have gone out the window in a misguided attempt to be equitable. I love and respect my brown
                       students, I am compassionate and understanding, and I know that they are as smart and
                       capable as white or Asian or any other students. So why do we as a school system not hold
                       them accountable for their potential and behavior? BCPS school policies which are obsessed
                       with race are despicable. This is the honest truth. I am not a racist whack job Republican. I
                       support reparations, I am "woke", I'm an anti-racist. What I am saying is what I believe to be
                       the truth.

          215            Students seems like they are in charge of the school..                                                3/23/2023 12:37 PM
          216            Educational excellence should be prioritized.                                                         3/23/2023 12:19 PM
          217            Student behavior becomes more challenging every year. Educators are feeling beaten down               3/23/2023 11:38 AM
                         and losing hope that the climate will improve. We feel as though the expectation is for us to
                         develop super-human patience and coping skills, while students and families are afforded
                         excuses, additional chances, additional effort on OUR part, etc. School staff are expected to
                         take on more and more responsibility for the success of students, as families and students are
                         held less and less accountable. Students and families seem to value education less than in
                         past years. Many students are neither interested nor motivated to learn the material being
                         taught, even as educators are working harder than ever to engage their students.
          218            behaviors class sizes are to large not being able to give a grade lower than 55 not being able        3/23/2023 11:02 AM

                         much middle management
          219            Attendance and tardiness is a big issue. Administration needs to be more involved in supports         3/23/2023 10:57 AM
                         teachers with student behavior. Teachers and staff need to feel respected by any supervisor
                         and not feel like everything is a "gotcha".
          220            The quality of education has been declining and the academic scores are reflecting this. While        3/23/2023 9:57 AM
                         Kirwin will bring millions of additional money to the school system, meaningful reforms need to
                         happen to improve learning and achievement for all students.
          221            Our internal structure inherently places departments and offices into silos, forcing the              3/23/2023 9:45 AM
                         academic side and business services side to stay separate. In order to foster a culture for
                         education for sustainability to flourish, we need to be united in our efforts and approach this
                         holistically, and encourage bridging the gap between the two sides of the BCPS house.
          222            Safety is a main concern. Area is popular to have alot of civilians & young kids out walking,         3/23/2023 8:52 AM
                         visiting stores, food places. The safety of the community is #1.
          223            Not just BCPS, but nationwide, these covid kids are STUNTED in every way: emotionally,                3/23/2023 7:57 AM
                         socially, and academically, And I feel like people are just trying to pick up where they left off.
                         These kids need to re-learn social skills, need emotional support and mental health sessions,
                         as well as a re-teaching kids "how" to learn. The damage inflicted on them, from missing two
                         years of school will be felt for decades. My husband teaches at the college level and he says
                         he sees the impact on these kids and their ability to learn. We need to re-think the "old" way of
                         doing things, and give these kids the care and skills they have lost. My daughter is struggling
                         with math. When she bombs a test, the teacher is unable to hand it back so that she can see
                         what she got wrong so she can learn from her mistakes. So then she falls further behind. But
                                                                            62 / 125

                        isn't that missing the point of education? To learn? But then earlier this week a whole afternoon
                        of classes were canceled so that Josten's could do a hard-sell live informercial to get kids to
                        buy class rings. WHAT? this is important...how? Look at the stats of % of kids getting
                        free/reduced meals. Look at inflation. Families are struggling and the idea that a public school
                        would waste precious class time to make kids feel bad who can't afford it, is infuriating. Sorry
                        for the long rant but we need a superintentdent that is less interested in media coverage and
                        status and one that understands the complex challenges these kids are facing and work
                        with/appeal to the Maryland State Education system to re-engineer the way we approach
                        educating our kids.
         224            Our county needs someone trustworthy who will last in the position for more than just a few       3/23/2023 7:50 AM
                        years, who understands the needs of the teachers
         225            There are educational gaps within the county that need to be fixed. Also, to be more aware of     3/23/2023 7:40 AM
                        everyone's mental health. Just because there are gaps, doesn't mean that everyone needs to
                        go to school for more days,more hours, more standardized tests. It means that we need to find
                        what is causing the gaps and hire highly qualified teachers who want to be here and help the
                        kids to work to close them.

         228            The legacy of racism and inequality in Baltimore County is significant. We are a large diverse    3/22/2023 9:41 PM
                        county with communities that do not seek to understand or support one another. A
                        superintendent that doesn’t put in the time to understand the nuances and qualities of
                        communities ex. Randallstown vs Woodlawn, Dundalk vs.Essex, Catonsville vs Arbutus will
                        not garner community support.
         229            There are too many executive level employees that are compensated over $200,000.00 per            3/22/2023 9:21 PM
                        year and there have been NO IMPROVEMENT in student achievement. Please take a strong
                        look at the employees that make so much money, yet have no accountability for the schools
                        they supervise! I'm a taxpayer and will soon plan to leave Baltimore County unless things turn
                        around.
         230            Be aware that in my community (Newtown area), we have slim to no options for middle school.       3/22/2023 8:36 PM
                        Please be aware that more houses continue to be built at Lyons Mills Blvd and Owings Mills
                        Blvd but their zoned elementary school is overcrowded. Be aware that if my zoned school is
                        extremely underperforming but I cannot afford McDonogh- I will request out-of-zone permission
                        and that’s just being fair. My child also deserves a decent education.
         231            Principals showing favoritism to their friends who work at their schools! Students who belong in  3/22/2023 8:15 PM
                        specialized schools or facilities. Listen to the educators when they talk, they hold the key to
                        the success of the bcps school systems future!
         232            Lack of leadership in the full sense. There are too many admin here for the title who treat       3/22/2023 7:39 PM
                        others as less than and who fail to engage with the faculty in a manner that empowers them to
                        be better. The salary scale needs to improve. We are in a shortage and those of us who still
                        teach are picking up the slack. We need better pay and better staffing.
         233            There seems to be a lack of cohesiveness between all BCPS schools as to what the                  3/22/2023 7:24 PM
                        consequences would be if students are not following the rules. Teachers don't feel like anyone
                        has their back when students act up and do not follow the rules. Students need to know safe
                        and appropriate boundaries and the consequences of what happens when they break the rules.
         234            Not every community is like ours and there are loads of children who are several grade levels     3/22/2023 7:02 PM
                        behind, with parents who have no clue how to navigate that.
         235            Many schools are out of control as far as discipline is concerned. Fighting, skipping class,      3/22/2023 6:35 PM
                        vaping, and defiance are big problems. They need to address this.
         236            The Special Education department is a complete DISASTER!!. Whoever decided it was in the          3/22/2023 6:10 PM
                        best interests of students and teachers to dissolve certain programs several years ago made
                        the biggest mistake I have seen BCPS make in the 20 years I have been a teacher here.
                        Schools, mainly classroom teachers, are expected to provide equal instruction to all students
                        and that is not happening because students with severe emotional and behavioral needs have
                        been placed in the general education setting with no support and their needs cannot be met in
                        that setting. I see this mainly in pre-k, kindergarten and first grade. Students, who, in the past,
                                                                         63 / 125
               Stakeholder Input Form--Baltimore County Public Schools                                                SurveyMonkey
                       before the dissolution of certain alternative placement programs, would have been placed in a
                       small group class with multiple adults specially trained in dealing with students with emotional
                       and behavioral issues, are now in our classrooms disrupting learning, eloping from classrooms
                       and buildings, screaming, cursing, throwing classroom furniture and materials, biting, punching,
                       and kicking the adults who try to intervene; and worst of all, causing trauma to all the other
                       students who are forced to witness the students' outbursts and the adult intervention. I
                       understand that the thought behind integrating these students into the general education
                       setting may have been based on equity; that certain populations of students were being over-
                       identified as requiring special placement. But now, equity in these classrooms has come to
                       mean that no one is getting their needs met-not the students with those emotional/behavioral
                       problems, not the students with learning needs, not the typical developing student, and not the
                       teachers. Is that the new meaning of equity? That no one gets what they need because a
                       small portion of students need a different placement (so they can eventually transition into a
                       general education setting after 2-3 years, having learned appropriate behavior, developed
                       coping strategies and gotten therapeutic resources) and a different placement is considered
                       not equitable? Because that is what is happening. We follow all the protocol of collecting data,
                       setting up interventions, getting them onto the team schedule for meetings, and calling Special
                       Ed. to come out and observe only to be told we aren't doing enough and hear the "have you
                       tried a sticker chart?", "have you tried using the student's picture in all the target areas?",
                       "have you tried having another student help them?" accusations. YES!! We have tried all of
                       that! That is why we called you, the supposed experts! In my school, there are students who
                       constantly scream and run up and down the halls when asked to do the little bit of work we
                       expect of them, disrupting all the other classes, being chased by our in-house special
                       education teachers, being escorted to the office by our principal, our assistant principal, our
                       guidance counselor. The reps from Special Ed, come out and say, "oh, they are fine. Just give
                       them what they want to stop the screaming." Why is this acceptable? Why must my little
                       students witness another student toppling a water cooler in the hallway? Why must my
                       students witness a teacher being bitten or kicked or punched? What is this doing to THEIR
                       development? How are they going to view relationships between teachers and students in the
                       future? You might think, "well, where are the additional adults that are assigned to provide
                       these students with support?" The answer is that they quit. Would you want a job where you
                       are bit, hit, punched and cursed at on a daily basis? How long could/would YOU tolerate that
                       abuse? And if those adults do manage to stay on board, they are not trained to handle the wide
                       variety of outbursts that occur. We have even asked Special Ed. to come and train those
                       additional adults and Special Ed. puts that burden on the individual school to pay for the
                       training. They simply refuse to invest the time to use their supposed expertise to help those
                       students who need them the most. When we have had BCPS behavioral specialists come in to
                       observe and advise, it is for a short time and the teachers fully acknowledge that the student
                       is more compliant when that TRAINED BEHAVIORAL SPECIALIST uses all the tools they
                       have; which only confirms that those students need more than what a general education
                       setting can provide. The county has worked in several mental health half-days into our school
                       calendar; but do you know what would be MOST beneficial to teachers' mental health? Having
                       programs where students with emotional and behavioral needs can get the help they need.
                       They aren't getting it in a general education setting. And by the time it is taken seriously, it is
                       too late for that student. Their behaviors have become so ingrained and habitual that their
                       whole school experience has been punitive. What will it take for change to happen? Staff and
                       parental lawsuits? Serious injuries to students and/or staff? A repeat of the Newport News, VA
                       incident?
         237           Infrastructure is a problem                                                                    3/22/2023 5:51 PM

          243           Discipline- we have given students conscious discipline and restorative practices for many           3/22/2023 1:56 PM
                        years and it is a great tool for the majority of our students. But there are some that need
                        greater interventions and consequences for serious behaviors. We need to keep our other
                        students and staff safe- as of now, they do not feel safe or supported by admin.
          244           That we are desperately asking for fair wages. School psychologists are in DESPERATE need            3/22/2023 1:48 PM
                        and in order for us to retain highly qualified individuals we need to be competitive in our salary.
                        This year we were down about 13 positions which led to us covering schools virtually and
                        having other psychs go test kids. That is not ideal for provision of services. I’m my current
                        position my ratio is 1:2400. 2400 students, 1 school psychologist. (This does not include my
                        coverage school) Around 360 kids with IEPs. The National best practice for that ratio is 1:500
                        for a comprehensive provision of services. We need to be paid for the extra duties that we are
                        required to take on.

                        offer better pay and supports. The lack of support teachers have been feeling, especially over
                        the last few years, with an increased workload and severe burnout is very real. Quality
                        teachers are leaving because of toxic work environments. Safety is a concern; behaviors have
                        increasingly become more dangerous/frequent.
          248           Special education teachers and support staff are very important to have in each school, yet          3/22/2023 1:16 PM
                        the schools are understaffed. It seems we have an escalated number of students with
                        behavioral needs and there isn't enough trained staff to help make the classroom less
                        dangerous. Due to having inclusion in our classrooms, this can make it difficult when a child
                        diagnosed with autism has a meltdown and due to the Special Education being understaffed,
                        this can be a distraction to the rest of the students. We need additional staffing hired for our
                        IEP students, and behavioral students. (the number of students with behavioral or emotional
                        problems has increased over the past two years.)
          249           Academic achievement struggles that pre-date the pandemic (we can't blame the pandemic).             3/22/2023 1:10 PM
                        We need someone who will take a close, critical look at curriculum, training, and practices to
                        get us moving in the right direction. We would definitely benefit from someone who
                        understands the benefit of investing time and money in a curriculum (and the needed training)
                        that teaches reading and writing with explicit phonics instruction. This could have a huge
                        impact if someone were willing to make that change! Behavior issues. There are consistent
                        complaints from parents, students, and teachers about behavior issues in schools;
                        specifically, there don't seem to be consequences and teachers don't get any support when
                        they reach out to their superiors about behavior problems. It's like a free for all and someone
                        needs to make some serious changes. Technology. While the devices were beneficial during
                        the pandemic, overall they were a big mistake. The cost has caused BCPS to take money
                        away from other areas of the budget to support the program and they have not delivered the
                        promised gains; in fact, student academic performance actually started getting worse after the
                        devices were introduced. They are a distraction in class, they often don't work well, WiFi is
                        spotty at best causing them to sometime be useless during class. While some exposure to
                        technology is good and necessary for our students, we need to completely rethink our over-
                        emphasis on technology (especially in all elementary grades). Relationship with the
                        community. For many years now, community members have repeatedly and consistently
                        experienced what I call "fake input opportunities." It seems that the school system goes
                        through the motions of getting community input on a variety of topics through surveys, public
                                                                           65 / 125

                        input at board meetings, email opportunities, and more. Yet, in the end, no one ever really
                        listens to anything we say. I have experienced so many times myself over the past 8+ years
                        as I've gotten involved in voicing my concern or opinion on matters. No one is truly listening at
                        BCPS headquarters.
         250            The community has a low level of trust for both the board, the superintendent, and the             3/22/2023 12:39 PM
                        superintendent's staff. a high level of transparency and communication will be necessary. most
                        of the current high leadership came from montgomery county with the old superintendent and
                        they are not good at their jobs. they don't know what they are doing and although they try hard,
                        they have been promoted too quickly into positions they know nothing about. it will be a weak
                        team to help the new superintendent.

                        lower level classes and many students well below grade level.

                        dysfunctional and individuals on the Board who remain do not trust their employees to do their 
                        jobs. Board Members have created a divisive and antagonistic relationship with employees. 
                        _________________________ has taken actionable steps to reintroduce trust between staff and 
                        the Board, but those Board members who remain (and a few who are new) and believe the 
                        social media posts of the general public rather than their employees have eroded the pride and 
                        commitment of employees serving BCPS.

                        need to put KIDS first - EVERY time and not fall in line with the BC machine of allowing
                        developers to have zero responsibility to better our communities and schools, while they make
                        millions. Total lack of transparency, currently, on so many levels. Loss of confidence in the
                        system and in many layers of leadership down from the Super by parents and community
                        members. Lowering of standards has greatly hurt BCPS (grading policy & cutting back on GT
                        staff as two examples.) Not admitting problems - you can't fix what you don't admit is an issue.
                        Violence and lack of consequences/supports in classrooms is making it difficult for even those
                        who want to learn, to do so. Teachers report no one is learning because of this issue. It's
                        fixable - new leadership needs to fix it. Office of Special Ed is a hot mess - mandated IEP
                        services not being implemented for many students. Totally understaffed for needs. Staff not
                        trained on IEPs/writing goals/etc. Compliance is an issue. Too many kids needing services
                        that should be happening effectively in Tier 1 and 2. Equity initiatives have been all talk and
                        little to no action. We are paying depts of people to work on equity and very little has changed
                        as a result. This is important work. Where are the measurable results of all of this effort, time
                        and energy?
         258            Baltimore county student and teacher safety has diminished. All kids are not punished for          3/22/2023 9:43 AM
                        breaking rules. Often, this is swept under the rug. This has directly impacted school
                        performance.
         259            Not enough counselors. Our children have a MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS going on and we need               3/22/2023 9:08 AM
                        social workers and teachers with psych backgrounds. The young teachers only know how to
                        educate…they are not equipped to handle a child with anxiety, depression, self harm, etc. then
                        there’s no counselors to turn to!
         260            The teachers and staff are overworked and underpaid. They have too many things to deal with        3/22/2023 9:06 AM
                        that are not teaching. The bus drivers need more support in their jobs (aides?) and need to be
                        paid more because they are so important in getting the kids to school on time and ready to
                        learn. Our English language learner population is growing and those teachers need support or
                        smaller classes. I am tired of the emphasis on technology over humans and the money spent
                        on computers versus teachers. Also, the Baltimore County buildings are aging and some
                                                                          66 / 125

                       teachers and students are asked to endure work conditions that would never be tolerated by
                       the central office people at Greenwood.
         261           The superintendent should watch out for the push to limit GT classes because of woke            3/22/2023 8:51 AM
                       ideology. We shouldn't be enabling poor behavior and lack of skills, but rather encouraging a
                       higher level of learning as an opportunity for all of the students to better themselves. The
                       superintendent should also lookout for allowing poor behavior as a norm in our schools. If we
                       expect better, we will get better. If we keep lowering our standards for equity, everyone gets
                       hurt. Be aware that students are often poorly guided at home and school is their place to feel
                       safe and learn. However, it is not the job of the school to parent. We need standards and
                       circumstances for behavior across the system that sets the right example. We cannot
                       continue have consequences for some kids that have a better home environment but not for
                       others that we may feel sorry for. Nothing will get better if kids know that they can break the
                       rules and there will be no action taken.
         262           Special education needs a lot of work. Progress tracking and meeting the needs of students      3/22/2023 8:22 AM
                       with learning differences are two specific areas of concern. Additional training and continuing
                       education for special educators is needed. Our schools are old and we need more schools
                       built. Transportation is a major issue in Baltimore County.

         267           We are a reactionary district. Decisions are being made by a few individuals who lack           3/22/2023 6:29 AM
                       supervisory experience. When things don't work out they become more entrenched rather than
                       examine their own decision making processes. We have lost so many top leadership staff, so
                       quickly, that much of our institutional knowledge has gone with them.
         268           Should make sure to talk with the teachers to be vigilant on disciplining any student who       3/22/2023 4:53 AM

                         don't work in their fields of study may need a reminder they are still valued in their community
                         regardless of their lifestyle. Some who sacrifice self care for personal preferences like for hire
                         jobs are the backbones to our community as an unpaid volunteer. Now, income earning
                         vehicles should be made more prevalent in this day or age of time. Some Americans learning

                         need extra time to finish work. Classwork may need to be changed as homework. Students,
                         teachers, and parents may need to focus on the alloted or allowed 8:45 a.m. to 3:10 p.m.
                         learning timeframe. Some parents will need to help their student track unfinished assignments.

                         present time for a student learner. All parents should be able to keep pace with their student

                         in 3 institutions for example as follows: homeschool/VLP/BCPS. Some BCPS Virtual Student
                         Representatives can not create a LIVE instructional, learning and historical moment being on
                         time within a seven hour period in a hybrid setting. Most parents want to remain their child's

                         stepping stones we need to improve in order to take care of our community. Some student
                         progress is not clearly shown when student learners microphone is not muted "on" so parents
                         and students working at home may be distracted by noises. Students have to show work or
                         attempt try its in not quiet classroom environments. Some students may need more virtual
                         field trips arranged by their parents, caregivers, teachers, guidance counselor, Principal,
                         Director, Former or Acting Superintendent to get a clearer understanding of our communities
                         with classmates and his or her role in the LIVE virtual program. Students may need more
                         independent study, facilitator and less social peer study group time to focus 100 percent of
                         attention span on learning while being filmed on a LIVE broadcast. Some teachers can not
                         focus on lesson plans with bus or cafeteria duty. Some teacher plans may not be created
                         before class. Some BCPS VLP has less teaching time, because of bus, nurse, cafeteria,
                         tardy, absentees, car ride or dismissal and cleanup duty times. Some students who have
                         increased their math practice time are being accused of using a calculator. Students have not
                         been introduced to a calculator. So, students will maintain the initial foundation of counting
                         using fingers, drawings and hardwork math concepts innovative techniques. It would be nice to
                         keep D.R.I.V.E and Pledge of Allegiance as a golden teachable moment on Friday Morning
                         Announcements and zero room for labels or unkind words towards student learners in the
                         homeroom. Some adults may want to refrain from using strong scented lotions upon a request.
                         Some may agree to not rub or use strong scented products but forget or not mindful of it.
                         Therefore, teachers will need to be professionals. Teachers, parent volunteers will need to
                         accept suggestions and recommendations from the community. Our chance to create a

                         record numbers, and the ones who are staying (because pension comes through in a few years 
                         or they just don’t have any choice) are burnt out, pulled to thin, and don’t have the energy or 
                         mental capacity to do an average job. Children are struggling across the board, children with 
                         learning disabilities served in a, pardon my French, half-________way, where they’re 
                         encouraged to fail before the parents who are advocating for them are taken seriously, and 
                         children who are advanced aren’t being challenged and wind up bored and disenchanted with 
                         learning. The bureaucracy of every single meeting and ridiculous processes is showing me that 
                         it’s not about a loving of learning or supporting children or even doing what is best for our 
                         children - our future
                                                                             68 / 125

                        - but what can most benefit the fat pockets and/or the schemes and/or the egos of the school
                        board. The thing is this isn’t just a BCPS problem, and I don’t expect BCPS to change the
                        whole system over night, but ultimately you have a responsibility in accepting this position to
                        know better and from that place do better. There is the potential for this county to be better - to
                        hire more well trained staff - yes that will cost you - but maybe you don’t need quite so many
                        folks or extraneous expenses. Maybe that means providing a stipend to the families that
                        desire and show a demonstrated need to move students out of their home schools and to a
                        more suitable learning environment. Drastic overhauls need to be made, and the past few
                        superintendents have only succeeded in making things worse.
         276            Historically segregated services for children with disabilities must be addressed. Students          3/21/2023 9:10 PM
                        should receive special education services in their home schools. Resources should be aligned
                        with a vision of inclusion.
                        Central office seems wasteful (too much money going there instead of schools), payroll and

                        office of certification sick at their jobs, teacher retention is a big issue and many teachers are 
                        leaving. Our schools are SO diverse and so many kids don’t have home support, or are 
                        immigrants in ELL. Teachers are doing work in the classroom but are having such a hard time 
                        overcoming student apathy, excessive student absences, and deficits caused by students 
                        promotion to next grade levels without mastering skills and content (almost everyone is 
                        promoted even if they actually failed the grade). We’re tired of hearing about test scores when 
                        students aren’t even coming to school to learn because they’re apathetic or chronically absent. 
                        My school can only send 5 students to project attend a year. We have so many kids that are 
                        late or absent every day and nothing is being done to get these kids to school. Behavior is an 
                        issue. Schools can’t discipline students anymore. Disruptive students are the norm and nothing 
                        is done about it.
         278            Overcrowding at Perry Hall Middle and High is a major issue. Myself and most other parents I         3/21/2023 8:52 PM
                        talk to are exploring private options which is extremely disappointing for so many reasons. I’d
                        also like to see PreK options expanded. Finally, politics should be kept out of schools. Period.
         279            Discipline is a huge issue in BCPS. There are no consequences for student behavior and the           3/21/2023 8:14 PM
                        students know this. Teachers are not allowed to enforce consequences on students. The
                        county is too focused on data collection and is not interested in doing what is best for
                        students. The curriculum is too jam-packed and moves quickly. There is no time for students
                        to practice and reinforce skills because of testing deadlines that are imposed. BCPS
                        leadership is very top heavy, so offices need to be streamlined. More programs are needed for
                        atypical learners. More support staff is also needed.
         280            Am not sure                                                                                          3/21/2023 8:05 PM

                        instead of random moves too far away from residential address.
         282            There is little consistency in the quality of schools, both in outcomes and climate. Poor local      3/21/2023 7:20 PM
                        school leadership is causing high quality, experienced teachers to leave BCPS for better
                        working environments.
         283            School violence, lack of any meaningful consequences for aggressive childrens' behavior, and         3/21/2023 7:12 PM
                        a constant push from progressive special interest groups to indoctrinate our children and
                        separating them into "victim" and "oppressor" groups. Our family thankfully has the resources
                        to pull our children from public middle school and send them to a private institution. Many do
                        not and they are frustrated and angry with the current school situation. Please stop blaming
                        COVID for the current situation and come up with real solutions that may allow families like
                        mine stay in the public school system.
         284            There are no good middle schools in the county. Violence is a major issue in the middle              3/21/2023 6:53 PM
                        schools. There are problems with districting and over crowding. The teachers are unhappy and
                        there is a lack of substitute teachers and aides. Test scores and failing academic achievement
                        is a huge concern and red flag that needs to be addressed.

                       make sense at the schoolhouse level. The system needs more specialized programs,
                       especially for children on the spectrum and children with behavioral disorders and it shouldn't
                       be so hard to get kids placed in these programs.

                       we need to value them and support their growth so they stay. This means revamping our
                       onboarding, New Educator Orientation and Induction programs, and providing more

                       member and unacceptable for those without a day of teacher training. We have a successful
                       teacher mentor program (PAR) that has been understaffed and overtaxed. If we provided
                       adequate supports to ALL new educators we would see better retention rates.

          303            Safety of students, teachers and staff are reaching a critical point. Violence in school is           3/21/2023 1:45 PM
                         becoming more and more prevalent. Many of our schools are overcrowded, structures are
                         undermaintained after years of limited funding. Parents are frustrated with what seems like a
                         constant list of questionable actions from BCPS. Students are behind in academics. Teachers
                         are overworked and still underpaid.
          304            We compete with private schools in the area. We need someone that knows our county. We                3/21/2023 1:36 PM

                         too many expectations. Parents are confused about how to help their kids.
          307            The issues across BCPS are common across the state and nation, but we need a                          3/21/2023 1:11 PM
                         superintendent who will listen to and seek answers from us and not become defensive when

                         concerns that I've noticed is how students are being pushed through Elementary and MIddle
                         School even if they have failing grades. There are no expectations in lower grade levels, then
                         all of a sudden they get to high school and are expected to pass every class in order to
                         graduate. Every grade level and every school should be preparing students for the next part of
                         their lives. Elementary for middle, middle for high, high for college or careers. We know that
                         their younger years can be defining moments for a person and if there are no expectations,
                         they will get to their high schools and be completely lost. Some of them will not take school
                         seriously because they think that they do not need passing grades in order to graduate. I truly
                         believe that it is unreasonable to put these expectations on children who have not had those
                         expectations for the first eight years of their education. BCPS should be ashamed. I also think
                         that the new superintendent should pay closer attention to the Special Schools (Public
                         Separate Day Schools) especially, Battle Monument because the children in these schools are
                         being taken advantage of by nurses, staff, administrators, and parents. Please keep special
                         education in mind. The way Battle Monument handled their students was emotionally and
                         mentally draining. Then the principal's boss would walk into the building, only listen to the
                         principal's perspective and leave. Of course the principal would lie and say everything was
                         good and leave. If those kids could go home, tell their parents what was happening at school,
                         there would be much more accountability for those administrators.
          310            Many students need help with managing emotions (fear, anger, sadness). This needs to be a             3/21/2023 12:44 PM

                        has an IEP plan and I want to ensure his school is able to foster his growth and stay within his
                        special needs while having the ability to keep him safe. I also think our teachers should feel
                        their value and be consistently supported in a very tough environment for education/teachers.
         320            Bullying is number one .                                                                            3/21/2023 11:26 AM

                        teach kids how to think for themselves. Leave social justice out of the picture, which promotes
                        more division.
         322            Teachers are extremely overwhelmed because existing and upcoming curriculum requires so             3/21/2023 11:16 AM
                        much more planning and prep than what is provided. Ex: Teachers in elementary school
                        receive 65 minutes to prepare and plan for 6 subjects/classes. This is not adequate time to
                        prepare the materials, make copies, plan, and create resources that are needed to instruct.
                        The existing materials and curriculum provided for teachers often do not include presentation
                        materials, materials prepared, and science and math especially, require so much time to read
                        through and understand the concepts needed to be taught, prior to being able to teach the
                        lessons. As teachers we have to spend hours daily creating the materials we need to teach.
                        This is a job of a curriculum designer and cuts into the time we need to focus on our families,
                        mental health, our administrative duties, connecting with students and families, and more. If
                        you ask me, this, is a huge reason teacher are leaving the profession. When teachers are
                        given surveys, it's a formality. The information isn't truly considered. It's just a box that can be
                        checked off, to say we asked the stakeholders. Teachers voices (face to face panels or written
                        feedback) should be considered when making decisions that impact instruction. I have seen
                        too many times when feedback was asked but the county already decided what they are going
                        to use. I saw this with the first devices being issues. The Lighthouse schools weren't really
                        effectively pilots as the technology was already purchased and decision for what was going to
                        be ordered was already made. I've seen this also with curriculum resources and other
                        decisions.
         323            Everything we know about childhood and adolescent development is out the window with these          3/21/2023 11:10 AM
                        students after the pandemic. It is not just about accelerating through what they missed
                        academically, they think, feel, act, and need differently.
         324            This is a diverse district with high expectations of ALL of our students.                           3/21/2023 11:08 AM
         325            BCPS schools are very different based on their location. We need differentiated solutions for       3/21/2023 10:57 AM
                        our unique schools. Administrators in the schools are the key to teacher retention.
         326            This question is a perfect example of why its so important to have an internal candidate as our     3/21/2023 10:53 AM
                        next superintendent. Someone who is well aware of the current climate and culture of our
                        school system is necessary and will save years of time.
         327            A shortage of teachers, special educators, instructional assistants, adult assistants and           3/21/2023 10:43 AM
                        substitutes along with student disciple problems is causing all school employees to feel burned
                        out, overworked, and exhausted.
         328            Teachers need higher pay, smaller classes, more resources (staff). We will continue to lose         3/21/2023 10:40 AM
                        quality educators without these things. I am a former BCPS employee who resigned.
         329            Special Education is a mess right now. Years ago we dismantled programs that support our            3/21/2023 10:18 AM
                        struggling students with special education needs. The county has placed these kiddos in the
                        gen ed setting with little to no support and general ed teachers can not and should not have to
                        do this alone. How we deal with problem behaviors is also an issue. there are no
                        consequences for students and families so this ridiculous behavior continues.
         330            While education is the priority, parents and teachers are concerned about safety in school          3/21/2023 9:57 AM
                        environments. Not just protecting against armed intruders, but ensuring that teachers and
                        students can feel safe to do their work. Providing support for the vulnerable kids who face
                        abusive home environments and bring their problems with them.

                         entire communities. While diversity offers a great deal in terms of the personal growth of
                         students and staff, it also provides challenges in supporting all students within a given school.
                         Social/emotional/behavioral challenges are creating unsafe environments in many middle and
                         high schools. I feel lucky to have two out of three local high schools that present as safe and
                         supportive environments. Our students require access to safe schools in which they are able
                         to access quality instruction from staff who are experienced, knowledgeable, and passionate
                         about their calling as educators. Which means that efforts must be made to retain our best
                         teachers, especially within areas with more challenging populations.
          334            Many schools have behavioral issues such as discipline, respect,focus and motivation that             3/21/2023 9:43 AM
                         bring down the quality of education for all students. Accountability is lacking given the leniency

                         the middle track, honors, and kids in middle school have to be in either gt or standards. The
                         progressive idea of getting rid of Honors was to push kids to take harder, ap gt classes, but

          340            Our district is very large which makes it difficult to manage with consistency. Often I hear that     3/21/2023 9:21 AM
                         families and teachers are not able to share their concerns and if they do these are not
                         addressed well. For example, transportation is not managed well and student behaviors

                         there are so many distractions that learning is secondary to testing, equity, facilities, teacher
                         moral issues, staffing, etc. All of the focus is currently on the worst performing kids. The

          346            The incoming superintendent should be aware that student behavior has become a problem.               3/21/2023 8:46 AM
                         Most students are coming to school ready to learn. There is however a pocket of students who
                         have deep emotional or behavioral needs that are not addressed at home. We try our best at
                         school, but we do not have adequate resources to truly address the problem. These students
                         disrupt the learning of the students who come to learn. If we had a plan to address this
                         behavior, BCPS schools would soar.

                       schools
         351           There is a lack of accountability and consequences for students regarding inappropriate          3/21/2023 8:21 AM
                       behaviors from the administration, countywide, therefore students are lacking respect for
                       themselves and others.
         352           1. Leadership of School Administrators: Leadership is greatly lacking at many schools            3/21/2023 8:17 AM
                       (confirmed with others I know). I am a high school teacher and have experiences and seen a 
                       great lack of leadership. Administrators are not visible, especially in classrooms. They do not 
                       support teachers who want students to learn. In other words, many teachers have given up on 
                       making students stay off phones, stay awake, do their work, be on time, etc. While I blame 
                       teachers, I blame the administrators. They should be in classrooms and professionally and 
                       privately correcting teachers who do not enforce high standards. Obviously, the lack of 
                       leadership results lower standards and thus less learning. However, it also results in not having 
                       a safe and orderly environment. Students who are constantly allowed on their phones are 
                       bullying others/engaged in conflict with others and the number of fights has greatly increased 
                       at my school. 2. Attendance at School no Longer Matters: I blame it on leadership mentioned 
                       in number 1 above, but too many teachers are allowing students to complete a very short and 
                       easy assessment that is automatically graded as the overwhelming majority of grades for their 
                       students. Also, they can retake again and again until they easily figure out the correct 
                       answers. As a result, students with chronic absenteeism received inflated grades because it 
                       does not matter if they read the readings, thought about the assignment, discussed with 
                       classmates, etc. My philosophy is that students should read every class, write every class, 
                       think every class, discuss every class, etc. As a result, they grow as learners. This 
                       philosophy is not the norm in too many classes. 3. Leadership of Superintendent: The present 
                       superintendent said, "Don't be surprised when I show up at a school unannounced." at a 
                       TABCO rep meeting. I doubt if he ever did that and certainly never did that at my school or 
                       schools where my friends teach. A superintendent should show up at schools and look for 
                       basic indicators of safety, discipline, and learning first. For example, walk into rooms 
                       unannounced and see if students are sleeping, on phones, etc. A teacher who does the most 
                       boring book work yet ensures students are on track will be more effective than a teacher who 
                       has higher level lessons, but no classroom management. I strive to have higher level learning 
                       and excellent classroom management. I would love to have a superintendent show up 
                       unannounced to my classroom. He/She will quickly see how well I do compared to other 
                       teachers. Unfortunately, the present administration does not see that because they only know 
                       teachers from saying hello in a friendly manner and judge no office referrals or failing grades as 
                       an outstanding teacher. A few walks into those teachers’ classrooms will show the true story of 
                       low standards. 4. Teachers who truly care about their profession and students feel intimidated 
                       to lower standards. In the past most students who had struggles with high standards would 
                       conform and achieve genuine success. At the beginning of the year, they would get upset 
                       when made to work, behave, be on time, etc. It is current practice to simply move students to 
                       another teacher’s class instead of guiding students to do what is right. I feel as if because of 
                       my age and being male, I get discriminated against a disproportionate amount compared to 
                       other teachers because students would rather have a young teacher. It started to dawn on me 
                       after being called, <Old man, _______ old man= by a student. Also, I handle after school 
                       detention for administrators after school. I work with two young teachers on an alternating basis 
                       who are stricter than me. They make students put cell phones on table, won’t let them use the 
                       restroom alone, etc. They don’t say please and thank you but get instance compliance. When I 
                       alone I ask students to <Please put your cell phones away= and explain the rules and get 
                       challenged. If you take my feelings and apply them to treatment by a few guidance counselors 
                       and most administrators who have never set foot in my classroom the problem of intimidation 
                       to lower standards is increased. I have a disproportionate number of students moved out of my 
                       classroom by two new guidance counselors. I am not told the reason and not given a chance to 
                       meet with student and guidance counselors. I am told <admin decision= and recent email not 
                       answered. Therefore, my conclusion is the students have said
                                                                        74 / 125

                        something that is not true or certainly have not admitted to their wrongdoings. If you were to
                        look at the discipline entries for students moved from my class, you will see a trend of chronic
                        discipline issues and failing grades. I conclude the problem is occurring with each department.
                        I have talked to teachers in other departments, and it is happening to them. When I was a
                        younger teacher, I was the teacher who had challenging students put in my classes. Now with
                        many more years of experience students are pulled from my classes by people who have
                        never come into my classroom.
          353           Communication is problematic. Teachers on the ground in classrooms have no effective way to          3/21/2023 8:15 AM
                        communicate with district leadership. When we see problems, it takes months for anyone to
                        even hear about it. BCPS also ignores a lot of educational research. We know a lot about how
                        kids learn, yet curriculum materials ignore this. We know kids learn and retain more with more
                        recess breaks, but they still only get 20 minutes a day. Bad administrators stay. No matter
                        how many teachers try to voice their concerns, nothing is done.
          354           Students are not accountable for the attendance or behavior. They "earn" service learning            3/21/2023 8:13 AM
                        hours through their classes, not by imagining and enacting real service. They are lacking
                        proper moral guidance for their development of responsible character/citizenship. High school
                        teachers have too many students (120-150) in the A/B schedule where they teach six. They
                        don't have enough time to provide meaningful feedback. The school curriculum should be
                        revised to include public speaking. The school board is rather dysfunctional.
          355           The extent of bullying in the schools and teachers turn a blind eye to it instead of addressing      3/21/2023 8:12 AM

          358           Please hold employees and students accountable. Harford county holds parents accountable             3/21/2023 8:03 AM
                        for their children. Parents are asked to attend school an entire day with their child for the first
                        offense. If BCPS did this more it would cut down on disruptive behavior and let the teacher
                        focus more on the students who want to learn.
          359           The person needs to recognize the experience and intelligence of the existing administrator          3/21/2023 8:01 AM
                        and not bring in "their" people. The person needs to shrink the size of Greenwood. We have to

                        is a feeling of us vs them between teachers and support staff vs administration and higher ups
                        in the county offices. This relationship needs to be repaired. This divide stems from poor
                        communication and the ransomware attack that has unveiled decades of poor management.
                        Teachers need more time to complete the constant and growing demands being placed on us.
          361           Teachers' time is not respected or valued. Students are not held accountable.                        3/21/2023 7:35 AM

                        public school and go into private schools will do so. The image of the district and the schools
                        is one of overcrowding, lackluster admin, and overwhelmed teachers.

                        suspensions. There has also been many cases of teachers allowing inappropriate
                        conversations to carry on among students that lead to altercations and fights. The next
                        superintendent should be working with the board and community leaders to create an
                        accountability system to hold leaders accountable.

                          superintendent will be to reestablish order. We need to discipline students and have 
                          consequences for chronically disruptive, disrespectful, and violent students. It is impossible to 
                          teach in some classes due to these types of behaviors. In my school it is widespread. There is 
                          a fear among administrators to discipline students when it involves suspension. _________ of 
                          the Randallstown NAACP said that by not consequencing students we are in essence 
                          increasing the the school to prison pipeline. I have witnessed student behavior escalate when 
                          logical consequences are not put into place.
          369             Rodgers Forge has a very high expectation as to the quality of the school. Parents expect the
                                                                                                                                      3/21/2023 7:20 AM
                          school to be clean and safe, and expect teachers and administrators to be highly competent
                          and friendly.
          370             Many students do not feel safe at school and there has been a big bullying problem. I have
                                                                                                                                      3/21/2023 7:18 AM
                          also talked to many teachers who cry on a daily basis because the students are so out of
                          control and there are no consequences. The teachers need support and students should be
                          held accountable for their actions if you want to keep teachers. I also think the pay for
                          teachers should be much higher than what it is due to inflation and the rising interest rates. I've
                          had several new teacher friends who are leaving the profession and making over 100k working
                          from home and are under a lot less stress. I've also seen a lot of wasteful spending including
                          additional positions which have not had any impact on the school. The additional workload of
                          SLOs has also been an issue. I work hard each year to analyze my data and work with
                          students to improve. However, I talk to other teachers who just use prior data and don't do any
                          work.
          371             This is a big county and it's fairly diverse, what's true in one part of the district is not                3/21/2023 7:18 AM
                          necessarily true for other parts.
          372             There is a lack of trust in the leadership in BCPS. As a teacher of 20+ years in this district, it          3/21/2023 7:18 AM
                          has been difficult to witness the teachers, parents, and students lose their sense of trust that
                          those in leadership are making moral decisions that truly have the best interest of the students
                          and teachers in mind.
          373             Better money for paras                                                                                      3/21/2023 7:16 AM
          374             Bullying is still an issue and various schools.                                                             3/21/2023 7:15 AM
          375             The real and/or perceived decline of Baltimore County schools; horrible staff morale; the                   3/21/2023 7:15 AM
                          perception of lack of transparency within the organization.
          376             Our school system morale is very low for teachers. There is a lack of trust in higher ups to                3/21/2023 7:13 AM
                          make decisions. Our school system preaches equity but we are still using old systems and a
                          lens of equality to make decisions about staffing, data, and funding.
          377             The district is very large and encompasses a large area that ranges from rural areas to more                3/21/2023 7:12 AM

          379             Discipline! These kids need to learn that there are consequences for bad behavior!                          3/21/2023 7:11 AM
          380             The schools are short staffed across the board and it is taking a toll on everyone and it would             3/21/2023 7:02 AM
                          would be beneficial to have some other type of recruiting, weather it be hourly wages, more
                          incentives or what not. And HR takes too long in the hiring process when we do get new
                          recruits.
          381             Behaviors are making it very difficult to teach. Many, if not all, classroom teachers are less              3/21/2023 6:59 AM
                          able to teach due to disruptive, vulgar or aggressive behaviors. The education of the students
                          should come first. In order to better educate the students, behaviors must be addressed.
          382             Some of our schools have poor reputations. The standards for all students have been watered                 3/21/2023 6:48 AM

                        down; there is a lack of rigor where deadlines and grades are concerned. We are not doing our
                        students a service when we allow work to be turned in up to two weeks late with no penalty.
                        We've opened up our GT and AP programs to all students which is great; however, we don't
                        allow anyone to fail even if the student is non-producing. The violence has increased across
                        the board, and it's harder and harder to have students removed from the school when they are
                        disruptive to the learning of others.
          383           Look at the fights and bullying that continues to grow in the public schools and protect the         3/21/2023 6:39 AM
                        staff. Staff are hesitant and afraid to teach in this atmosphere. Make the actions more
                        stringent on the students who partake. Show them a little authority. Back your staff!
          384           Segregation in the county and our map scores being below the national average. Also, the             3/21/2023 6:32 AM
                        math curriculum we currently use jumps all over the place. There has to be something better.
          385           It seems many of the areas that pay the higher taxes due to having higher incomes also get           3/21/2023 6:30 AM
                        their construction project needs addressed sooner than many of the lower taxed
                        neighborhoods. That is not equality. Many of the lower taxed neighborhoods need the
                        specialized programs more than the higher taxed neighborhoods. They should have the same
                        opportunities. However, it is understood that some of those neighborhoods also have a parental
                        structure that may be in a disarray and complicated, therefore, helping those that need it most
                        is not always easy.
          386           Discipline is a serious issue in schools. There are no consequences for disruptive students.         3/21/2023 6:17 AM
                        Students who want to learn suffer because disruptive students monopolize the time of
                        teachers and administrators.
          387           Mental Health days have been very helpful for everyone. Considering everyone's safety when           3/21/2023 6:15 AM
                        closing schools for any reason is important. A superintendent should be seen visiting schools
                        and offices. School safety is a priority.
          388           We need to find a way to have smaller class sizes, more special educators, more mental               3/21/2023 6:12 AM
                        health supports, and hire and retain our staff. We need more support for our inclusion students
                        and we need to be realistic about our expectations for one on one supports. Educator workload
                        needs to be manageable and sustainable.
          389           Need more support in classrooms for teachers when ratio of students is 20-30 to 1 teacher.           3/21/2023 6:06 AM
                        Need more supportive staff for special Ed.
          390           Communication could be improved. There is too much communication that is not important or            3/21/2023 6:04 AM
                        relevant-and the stuff we should know is buried on websites. (redistricting) We have had 2 poor
                        superintendents back to back and the district has suffered for it.
          391           We need to pay teachers more who work at title one schools in order to keep them from being          3/21/2023 6:00 AM
                        training facilities. Title one schools struggle to find staff and end up with brand new teachers.
                        Once they are trained and competent they leave for a less stressful environment thereby
                        perpetuating the struggle at title one schools. Those are the schools that need consistency
                        and high quality educators buy there is no incentive for educators to stay there.
          392           the superintendent should attempt to be more representative of all people in Baltimore County        3/21/2023 5:47 AM
                        and not just a few. This is no small task since it is a rich and diverse community.
          393           Elementary instruction does not have as much rigor as I would like to see. Few opportunities         3/21/2023 5:44 AM
                        for enrichment for students that have already mastered skills, especially in math. Not enough
                        differentiation in ELA. Administration should have regular communication via newsletter, etc.
                        Classroom behaviors are extremely disruptive to learning and are difficult for the young
                        children to witness and handle emotionally. Field trips and other opportunities have been
                        limited. There are 5th grades in my school that have never been on a field trip. I would love to
                        see more experienced teachers at the schools that are Title I.
          394           Teachers and staff should be accountable to help the students and sometime parents need              3/21/2023 4:39 AM
                        help too. This should be everyone’s top priority- often times in a district this size, it is not.
          395           Nor that I know of                                                                                   3/21/2023 4:17 AM
          396           The superintendent should be aware of the many students that didn't do so well during the            3/20/2023 11:55 PM
                        covid shut down. Although we had virtual programs that were better than not having nothing,
                        many families suffered a great deal of trauma from many different things, especially the loss of
                        parents, grandparents, siblings and close friends etc.. A good superintendent would be able to
                        understand and know that we are in a recovery stage and act accordingly.

                        developed a reputation of pacifying students and their parents in fear of resulting law suits, so
                        the system does not hold students and their parents accountable, leading to poor-performing

          411           We are so large and each area has it owns needs, values, and expectations. We are in need a          3/20/2023 8:14 PM
                        positive leadership, one that wants to be visual and accessible to teachers, students,
                        parents,etc...
          412           Parents want transparency and need to be involved in the curriculum as well as decisions on          3/20/2023 8:06 PM
                        how the school culture is shaped.
          413           The teacher's union is protecting bad teachers. As a superintendent, you have to care about          3/20/2023 8:05 PM
                        kids and their education. There is no accountability at the highest levels of the school
                        systems. Hold yourself to a higher standard and then hold everyone under you to the same
                        standard. Don't just say it, do it.
          414           Behavior needs to be addressed. Students talk back and talk throughout lessons, so how can           3/20/2023 8:01 PM
                        students learn and teachers teach. We are tired of hearing it is the teachers
                        fault....responsibility needs to be taken by students and parents. Boundaries and framework
                        need to be set.
          415           Many Schools are overcrowded/large class sizes-not enough schools to house the student               3/20/2023 7:56 PM

                        lack of support, both financially and emotionally, to the teachers and related service providers
                        working directly with the students, they have resigned/left the school system in droves. Too
                        much time, energy, and money has been spent focused on new curriculum and putting in place
                        new programming, vs. hiring and retaining quality teachers and service providers! It doesn't
                        matter what new curriculum and programs are being taught/used, if you have no one to teach
                        and support them!!!
         416            There are a lot of fights and violence in the schools between students and student towards        3/20/2023 7:56 PM
                        teachers. People get hurt somewhere every day.
         417            It is a large, diverse district! The needs of some of the schools can often be overlooked         3/20/2023 7:49 PM
                        because of <fires= that needs to be out out elsewhere. Having good people who are willing to

                        instructional strategies is limited to almost lacking -current BCPS is very top heavy in central
                        offices- supports are needed inside schools

                        following COVID, it feels like so many students were lost - Growing ESL population that needs
                        our support (and PD for teachers to meet the need) - A loud, well-funded minority of parents
                        that want to control everything their children learn (such as real history, sex education,
                        diversity of voices in literature) - an exhausted workforce that is tired of being pandered to -
                        discipline issues that wouldn't be issues if educators were fully staffed, trained, and prepared
                        to meet the needs of all children - the mental health crisis in general - hopefully, a slightly more

                        issues for students but the reality is that there aren’t any designated services or money for
                        programs.
         424            1. Students are damaging computers. There are students who have intentionally damaged
                                                                                                                          3/20/2023 7:16 PM
                        several computers and they keep on getting new devices without penalty causing systemic
                        shortages. 2. There is a culture of truancy and students using abusive language and behaviors
                        with other students and staff. These students have no at home consequences and are not
                        responsive to school consequences or parents will not support after school/ Saturday school
                        consequences. Some of these students have such disruptive behavior that little learning can
                        happen in some of our classrooms. There are students that wander the room hitting and
                        kicking other children during lessons -even in 8th grade classrooms! We have students using
                        drugs and sharing with friends in middle school without consequence. We have students with
                        30+ referrals and students who want to learn and the teachers and students are trapped within
                        classrooms with them. BCPS will not send these students for time outs to alternative schools.
                        The only students who are getting time outs to alternative schools are students who have
                        engaged in extreme physical violence such as deliberate attacks on other students.
         425            The lack of Culturally Responsive School Leadership Schools continue to be disconnected           3/20/2023 7:08 PM
                        from the communities they claim to serve.
         426            Testing. Violence In school. Lack of communication with parents, when things are going on in      3/20/2023 7:06 PM
                        school. Schools need to be in better repair. These kids should know how to count money and
                        learn more life skills in school before high school. They should know how to write term papers.
                        Mock interviews should start before 12th grade. Children have to be taught according to how
                        they learn. Ensure that people are qualified for the subjects in which they teach. Hire the best
                        of best to teach at the elementary level.
         427            Our staff is tired. We appreciate the raises (we are supposed to get), but the constant cuts in   3/20/2023 7:05 PM
                        staff while we are trying to offer more services to more kids with greater needs is exhausting.
                        While BCPS continues to ask more of their school-based staff, they still flock to every new
                        idea or fad that comes down the road. Staff are constantly having to adjust or add new
                                                                         79 / 125

                        "strategies" or find a way to offer "edutainment" that does not change how students perform. If
                        BCPS is going to hold teachers accountable for their data, then systemic problems with
                        behavior, drug use and attendance need to be addressed in a cohesive, equitable way. The
                        new superintendent needs to know that schools in the lower SES areas are inundated with
                        social issues that other schools do not have to spend the time and energy on- we don't perform
                        at the same level on standardized tests/measures because we spend so much time trying to
                        overcome the issues that walk through our doors and still maintain a safe haven for our
                        students.
          428
                        That many people want to be involved in our community just as other affluent areas. We have          3/20/2023 7:01 PM
                        care givers who are not have technology skills to access or stay connected with our system.
                        This deficit needs to be addressed. Many grandparents ect do not even have emails. How are
                        we empowering our immigrants? We have students translating for parents on forms they do not
                        understand.
          429           Schools are in a drastic decline. Education, safety, communication within the communities and        3/20/2023 6:56 PM
                        funding are my major concerns.
          430           The new superintendent. Needs to be aware of paying attention to the teachers needs. An how          3/20/2023 6:55 PM
                        much better they can help their class. Plus more get need extra help for the teachers. Plus
                        teachers need more money. I really don’t think the teachers are getting paid for the work they
                        do. Plus my daughter says the teachers don’t put their grades in when end of quarter. An the
                        kids don’t know their true grades. Plus we need to have more mental illness help in the school
                        o. A recommendation of a class should be reviewed. To help more students.
          431           Our schools are at the hearts of our communities. Our children deserve to have quality               3/20/2023 6:52 PM
                        education, yet be understood. There is a whole in our system that is not easily filled. With so
                        many professionals feeling the stress, lack of respect, and poor compensation, they are
                        leaving the system and profession. Our superintendent needs to be able to recruit amazing
                        teachers and staff, and offer them all of the benefits and resources they deserve to be
                        successful, thus help our students to be successful.
          432           The tendency for our educational curriculum to become political. It's not ok for a well rounded      3/20/2023 6:48 PM

                        on them mentally.
          435           Lack of transparency with the board. Things should not be hidden from us s parents and               3/20/2023 6:31 PM

          437           The amount of social biased racism is getting out of control. That coupled with kids threatening     3/20/2023 6:28 PM
                        to kill other teachers and students while nothing is is done about it and this light on crime

          439           Not enough counselors. Our children have a MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS going on and we need                 3/20/2023 6:18 PM
                        social workers and teachers with psych backgrounds. The young teachers only know how to
                        educate…they are not equipped to handle a child with anxiety, depression, self harm, etc. then
                        there’s no counselors to turn to!
          440           Morale is at an all time low. Teachers are overworked and underpaid. Teachers have been              3/20/2023 6:10 PM
                        given lip-service in the forms of public words of support. Sadly these usually occur after an
                        incident/complaint rather than proactively. We are tired. We are defeated. We need to be
                        seen/heard and recognized for the professionals that we are with having our teaching targets
                        constantly changing.
          441           Many school leaders lack the experience and maturity to manage staff and to effectively              3/20/2023 6:07 PM
                        address the day to day needs of students, parents and teachers. This is a huge county with
                        very different needs from one zip code to the next. Parent support varies greatly. BCPS has
                        lost much of the respect and trust that it had 15 years ago. The system has fallen into the trap
                        of spending large sums of money on unproven programs rather than investing in its teachers.
                        Many teachers are leaving because of weak and inconsistent discipline policies that have
                                                                           80 / 125

                        resulted in unsafe and chaotic conditions in many schools. BCPS has a growing population of
                        students with special need and English language learners, yet lacks the staff and support staff
                        to adequately meet the need of these children. Department chairs are unable to meet the
                        needs of their teachers because they are overtaxed by covering classes and doing the work
                        that should be getting done by principals and assistant principals. BCPS has a history of
                        talking about equity, yet in practice, we use equity language to lower expectations that has
                        caused the achievement of all students to decline. As a side note, the system continues to
                        blame COVID for all of its declines while the trend started long before the pandemic.
         442            We are an extremely large district with a diverse population of students. With such a large         3/20/2023 6:03 PM
                        number of schools spread throughout a large county, it is hard for one person to efficiently
                        oversee and manage day to day tasks effectively. Teachers are overwhelmed and do not feel
                        supported by the district.

         446            Our district sometimes feels too large. What works in the central area or what those                3/20/2023 5:51 PM
                        constituencies want may be a far cry from what people need in the Northeast area, for
                        example. The parents who are the squeakiest wheels are often the ones with the most
                        privilege, and that may be a difficult legacy to overcome. We have a lot of obstacles stemming
                        from factors that were put in place before many of us were born, but they live on in legacies of

                        from one end to the other).
         448            There are a lot of people who want to ban books, who are anti LGBTQ, and who don’t support          3/20/2023 5:41 PM
                        public health measures. In this area there are also people who actively push Christian
                        beliefs/propaganda in schools and promote hate for certain groups. These people seem to be a
                        small minority but are the most vocal. The superintendent should not cater to groups who
                        represent minority views just because they <yell= the loudest.
         449            1) With the cost of college and student debt rising I feel that we under value and under budget     3/20/2023 5:40 PM
                        vocational tech schools. I feel that telling every student that walks through the door that they
                        should go to college and be a doctor or lawyer can be wasteful. Wasteful to the parents
                        finances and the teachers time. Im sorry, but not every person is suited to go to college. There
                        are plenty of trade/vocational paths that can and should be explored. I dont know how many
                        times that I have seen students graduate with a wasteful degree that cannot be applied in the
                        real world. Mechanics, HVAC, Electricians & Plumbers do well for themselves. 2) There is a
                        serious and scary problem with out of control teenage behavior in schools. Fighting, talking
                        back to and threatening teachers, peers, parents. I feel that in this day and age, there is NO
                        accountability when students do something wrong. Expulsion should be used more. The <no
                        child left behind= has worsened everything because it wastes time and energy on bad kids that
                        dont care and others pay the price. I feel like everyone (i.e. Teachers, Administration, Parents)
                        are so afraid to stand up to or say something because it will always get twisted into something
                        its not. I feel that someone needs to analyze the data, look at the numbers. What schools
                        have behavior issues, assaults, etc. Then dig into the metadata - what kind of individuals are
                        causing the issues? Data is something important that I think everyone ignores. There are
                        reasons kids act out in schools. There are reasons that home schools that are situated in high
                        crime areas tend to have students with behavior problems, poor grades and that school has
                        poor school ratings. Look at Hawthorne, Lock Raven, Middle River Middle & High,
                        Chesapeake, Kenwood, Dundalk, Perry Hall, Parkville Middle & High. I mean back in the early
                        2000’s, Perry Hall and Parkville were very respected but not so much now. 3) I am not
                        comfortable with the current trans issues within schools and would like assurances that boys
                        (born genetically male) are NOT allowed in sensitive areas (locker rooms, bathrooms, etc.) of
                        female students. I also DONT think its fair to have trans people play sports against the
                        opposite born sex, especially if there are scholarships or grants involved. I think just like
                        women sports are separate of mens, trans should have their own category. I am all for
                        inclusion, but not at the expense of the security of others. I AM a female and I dont like how
                        as a woman I feel like all the advances we’ve made are being pushed aside for new different
                        groups. I feel like we (genetically born women) are being appropriated and erased. 4) I think

                        areas and not enough schools to support said growth that we need to start fighting back to
                        politicians who <approve= these new housing developments without them actually looking into

                        occasions that they were served food that was expired or molded. That is unsafe and
                        detrimental to their health.

         454            For the whole county I think a candidate should be aware of different needs for different         3/20/2023 5:16 PM
                        schools within it. I would like a candidate strive for equity in education for a students.

                        teachers keep saying what we need (small class sizes, support for students including
                        counseling and Special Education, competitive pay) but no one is listening. The system
                        cannot be top heavy with many positions at the top and those of us in the schools struggling to
                        make ends meet as costs around us increase. Teachers will leave because we have
                        marketable skills.

         459            One frustration that I have found living in the Hereford zone is that decisions that are made for 3/20/2023 5:06 PM
                        the county at large do not adequately reflect the needs and desires of the small group of
                        schools in the Hereford zone. Policies that may work well in a larger suburban or urban school
                        setting do not translate well to a small rural school setting. We often feel forgotten about, or
                        cast aside in addition to almost always having to adopt policies that were made without our
                        school in mind.
         460            The level of fear this current administration has fostered. How everyone is afraid to speak up    3/20/2023 5:05 PM

         461            There is no discipline or consequences for poor behavior. Poor behavior children get rewards      3/20/2023 4:56 PM
                        while the well behaved children get dismissed. Additional Assistants are abused regularly and
                        have to stand there and take it. AA's are the first line of defense for these behavior problems
                        and every AA should be CPI trained before starting. There is O training, minimal pay and AA's
                        are treated poorly by a lot of staff. Turn over rate is high because of these issues.
         462            Please engage shared leadership with those that make <the main thing- the main thing=. We         3/20/2023 4:56 PM

                        and are not consistent with best practices such as school wide interventions. Also, in
                        Catonsville Elementary, the message from the Principal following COVID cases has been for
                        everyone to wear a mask and to socially distance. However our observations have been that
                        since the start of the 2022-2023 school year, neither the Principal, nor teachers have worn
                        masks; in many situations social distancing was not possible in the school. Accountability

                        That teachers are not always seen as professionals/experts in their field. That teacher
                        retention should be a top priority, and that monetary compensation should be given to ensure
                        this retention outside of a one time bonus.

                        problem is we don't KNOW if it'll stay), top-heavy leadership outside of school buildings, not
                        enough support staff or leadership in buildings ever, constantly out of compliance with IEP's,

                        up due to poor sub coverages or lack of special educators, inconsistencies in special

                        ESOL student had an OBVIOUS disability but won't even be acknowledged yet due to being in

         492            Our school have taken a sharp downward turn in terms of their success at educating students.         3/20/2023 3:46 PM
                        Quality teachers are leaving. Many students have left to go to independent schools. The
                        children left behind who can’t afford private education are left with fewer quality teachers. The
                        buses are overcrowded and the bus rides to our home are over an hour.
         493            Student scores are below expectations and the culture needs to be rebuilt to one of trust and        3/20/2023 3:44 PM

         494            Central administration doesn’t support our teachers enough. Morale is low, in my estimation          3/20/2023 3:44 PM
                        due to failure to hold poorly behaved children accountable.

         497            Issues the superintendent should be aware of is the payroll department for baltimore county.         3/20/2023 3:38 PM
                        They are very unorganized and move very slow when correcting mistakes they have made with
                        employees checks.
         498            Staffing is an issue - schools lose more and more good humans who work with students. It can         3/20/2023 3:38 PM
                        be a problem to offer TOO many choices in terms of courses and extracurricular at a young
                        age - the core groups get smaller and cannot provide the important synergy and group lessons
                        at times because of this.
         499            BCPS struggles with equity issues, especially with the treatment of students of color.               3/20/2023 3:37 PM
                        Additionally, the increase of violence within schools and the community (weapons and fights)
                        speaks to a greater need. Rather than trying to address the root problems, our schools and
                        communities try to suspend or punish the behavior. We need to explore the root cause and
                        increase the amount of outside of the box thinking and community partnerships.
         500            The service model to the schools is not as strong as it once was. School staff should have           3/20/2023 3:36 PM
                        coordinated support to address any safety issues, behavioral issues, instructional concerns,
                        equity concerns, and staffing issues that arise. All offices need to communicate with one
                        another and with stakeholders in a timely manner and they should also trust the input of their
                        stakeholders.

                        understand curricula and the need for fidelity of curricula to be implemented. Understaffing is
                        significant in central office and safety issues persisting in the Jefferson Building. Staff
                        continue to express fear and concern with the unsafe area with crime rising and violent
                        assaults and this has not been addressed adequately. We are losing top candidates due to
                        lower pay. Need a complete overhaul in HR, from hiring to prompt processing of
                        reimbursements, etc.

                        As a leader, it is very hard to follow expectations when there is no clear expectation from the
                        central offices. Changes are currently being made so rapidly and haphazardly that it is difficult
                        to know what we should be doing in our own schools. BCPS is full of very talented staff, give
                        us the opportunity to do our job and show what we can do without micromanaging. As such,
                        the last few Superintendents have restructured central office personnel and often bring
                        personnel from their previous districts to fill high positions. Why not look in to BCPS leaders to
                        fill those positions? Unfortunately, at the same time, there are leaders in positions at both the
                        district and school levels who should not be, due to poor attitudes and inability to lead. These
                        individuals regularly hinder the work of the true leaders within BCPS. Finally, help provide a
                        curriculum that is beneficial for students. While technology is useful and part of the world's
                        future, it cannot be sole way for teaching. Many of the district curricula still focus on virtual
                        lessons. It is time to move away from the computers and return to using them as a resource,
                        not a teaching method.

         511            I've heard concerns with the BCPS's approach to DEI and how it treats and supports students       3/20/2023 3:19 PM
                        of color.
         512            Should be aware that these kids often come from broken homes, parents with substance              3/20/2023 3:19 PM
                        abuse, and a very poor outlook on life. The teachers are less and less empathetic to these
                        kids, most new teachers are not qualified to teach here, these teachers do not respect children
                        as individuals and treat them like prisoners. If the teachers don’t know how to regulate their
                        emotions and words how do they expect the kids to do it also?? To much of swept under the
                        rug. Teachers are unorganized and are always loosing assignments that are turned in and
                        blame the child, the children need to be help accountable as well, there is favoritism and
                        certain kids get away with too much and it’s a lot of problems
         513            There is a level of mistrust from the higher levels down to the schools. Taechers are TIRED of    3/20/2023 3:18 PM
                        new things. Communication and decision making need significant work. Unions rule the
                        district. We need to get some of the extra pay and working times under control. Special Ed
                        offices do not follow the direction of the team decsion. School decisions are over-ruled without
                        thought. The allocation of resources needs to be looked at. Not just Title one needs resource
                        and STAT teachers, all schools deserve resource positions

                        room for kids to even sit at lunch. Kids who have to buy lunch (mostlylow income) have to
                        physically run to lunch because there are so many people in line that most days they dont
                        even get enough time to sit and eat their meals. Its sad and not fair!
          515           This district is very large and diverse and different areas have different needs and opinions.        3/20/2023 3:16 PM
                        There needs to be less administrative power and positions at the top and more empowered
                        principals and teachers at the local level. There is also a very strong political undercurrent on
                        our board that is concerning and affects important decision making, causing distress in
                        meetings.

                        there is a violent fight weekly. I saw a video , have a copy of the male coach beating a child 
                        like a man. Baltimore county needs to take examples from other jurisdictions who are 
                        transparent about their disciplinary issues instead of worrying about image. It’s just sad and I’m 
                        happy he is done, my child suffered between constant fights and classroom distractions and 
                        over personal teaching staff. Why does my child constantly come home telling me personal 
                        stories that a teacher should keep to themselves.

                        here in the county and what is happening is parents are taking their gifted kids out of the 
                        public school system for many reasons and placing their kids in the private sector. I would like 
                        to see a superintendent that makes BCPS schools the schools of choice for every family !

                        and voice in decision-making. New teachers have been leaving at an alarming pace. There is a
                        lack of support for new teachers especially.
          527           Baltimore County should not be one huge school district. It’s too big. Break it up so schools         3/20/2023 3:06 PM
                        can get the services they need.
          528           Even though there is a teacher shortage, we need to pay closer attention to the culture and           3/20/2023 3:06 PM
                        climate of our classrooms. Teachers who are passive agressive, burnt out, and emotionally
                        detached are tolerated. It impacts all of our students and not all of them have parents that
                        advocate. More accoutnability for principals controlling the climate of their schools is huge!

          531           All reading instruction should be switched to the science of reading- and all prior programs         3/20/2023 3:05 PM
                        should be tossed. Teachers should be paid fairly. Discipline and consequences have fallen by
                        the wayside. Schools need to be safe places for learning.
          532           The superintendent should be aware of overcrowded schools and make re-zoning a priority.             3/20/2023 3:05 PM

                        political connections they have. if we took the politics out of the school system then the
                        person we select will have a chance.

                        attention to focus on reducing class size for all core subjects. Even though are parents are
                        doing their jobs, the school system has been failing us for several years. This fact is based
                        upon the Maryland Schools report card as well as data from our middle school that was
                        recently released according to 8th grace MAP scores. Our students, if following trends and
                        data will not be College and Career ready upon the date they should graduate. This is being
                        ignored to the detriment of our students and community. Our community is tired of increasing
                        student achievement across all categories if students not being the sole focus of our
                        educational system.
          535           Whatever superintendent comes, needs to support equity and justice work for Black and Brown          3/20/2023 3:02 PM
                        children. There is too much going on in the world where it is anti-Black, anti-LGBTQ, anti-
                        Latino. We cannot have that in Baltimore County where the there is an undercurrent of racism
                        and inequity which also exists.
          536           Historic and systemic racism are still prevalent in our discourse, politics, & communities that      3/20/2023 3:01 PM
                        have held back some of our communities.
          537           COMMUNICATION Communication between offices and schools, admin and teachers, and                     3/20/2023 3:01 PM
                        direct student contact positions vs. non-contact positions is appalling. NO ONE LISTENS
                        There is no one listening to contact providers about what works and what does not.
                        BEHAVIOR Is totally out of control and lack of discipline is a huge reason why. There are no
                        consequences for students in our youngest grades which grows students who become more
                        and more disrespectful as the proceed through the grades. GRADES There is no consequence
                        for poor grades creating a cycle of allowing students into the next grade or class no matter
                        their proficiency. Students are passed along with no time given for remediation and it is our
                        students who are living with the long term consequences. APPROPRIATE SUPPORT FOR
                        HELPING TEACHER HONE THEIR CRAFT IS NOT AVAILABLE What sense does it make to
                        cut teacher resource positions when our teachers need to learn better strategies for teaching
                        math. We cut the elementary math office in HALF when we have the WORST math scores in
                        our history. Our teachers need more support, not less.
          538           The new Superintendent needs to know and understand BCPS. There is no time or need to                3/20/2023 3:00 PM
                        bring a new Superintendent from outside BCPS. We have many qualified candidates within
                        who know what is working and what needs to be fixed.
          539           Violence in the middle and high schools are out of control. The <no child left behind= act has       3/20/2023 2:59 PM
                        destroyed our education system. More police are needed in all middle and high schools.
          540           Student discipline (and hence student safety) are a concern. I feel like administrators are more     3/20/2023 2:59 PM
                        worried about bad days than curbing bad behavior.
          541           Gap in hiring top administration and board members that reflect the student body and                 3/20/2023 2:58 PM
                        understand the needs of the majority of students in the school system.
          542           Lots of students are struggling with mental health!! BCPS advertises that they support MH            3/20/2023 2:58 PM
                        issues for students but the reality is that there aren’t any designated services or money for
                        programs.
          543           The people in school are wanna be people on the streets that cause problems. most of them            3/20/2023 2:58 PM
                        root from home issues so be aware .. people like students even need chances to explain
                        themselves and their situations they might be in.
          544           There absolutely needs to be a plan for disruptive students. We have students who                    3/20/2023 2:57 PM
                                                                           87 / 125

                        consistently interrupt class and go to the principal s office yet armrest back in class the next
                        day. My daughter usually loves school but due to disruptive students has had anxiety about
                        going to school.
         545            Overcrowding issues, aging buildings. A push from some to remove diverse books from                3/20/2023 2:57 PM
                        schools (eg LGBTQIA+ families represented, different cultures and races represented). We
                        need a Supe who will stand for equity, diversity and inclusion.
         546            There is a HUGE overcrowding issue and I think that the teaching suffers for it. 1 new middle      3/20/2023 2:56 PM
                        school will not fix this. When couple that with the rising violence in the Perry Hall Schools,
                        particularly the MS and HS it has me looking for private schools. The state of Perry Hall
                        Middle is not something I want my son to experience.
         547            Transparency from the superintendent and central office have been lacking, as has                  3/20/2023 2:55 PM
                        consistency in discipline. These MUST be addressed.

         549            The area is expanding, we do not want the schhols to be overpopulated.                             3/20/2023 2:54 PM
         550            The discipline policy is not great. There are no consequences for student behavior. We need to     3/20/2023 2:53 PM
                        hold students accountable for behavior while providing support to help them regulate their
                        behaviors and emotions. People don't listen to the teachers when we give feedback and/or ask
                        for things. We consistently tell people what isn't working etc., and it's like talking to a wall. We
                        need more supportive--social workers, support staff etc. Teachers are asked to do more and
                        more each year with no help.
         551            Put the emphasis back on learning. We need in school learning. let teachers teach curriculum.      3/20/2023 2:53 PM
                        Stop with all the political nonsense (covid, etc)
         552            How overcrowded and understaffed reisterstown Elementary is. Also we are the only school           3/20/2023 2:52 PM
                        that feeds from Hannah Moore women’s shelter with kids with major trauma and no support
         553            The candidate must be aware of the issues that BCPS has faced in the past, specifically the        3/20/2023 2:52 PM
                        lack of leadership and transparency in previous superintendents. There is a lack of trust
                        among administrators toward previous superintendents.
         554            Definitely the bullying that is aloud to go on in the schools, the figgts and violence. Teachers   3/20/2023 2:52 PM
                        and principals do nothing in my opinion. Enough with so much testing in the state especially
                        for elementary students ridiculous
         555            Teacher retention issues, decline in student behaviors/conduct in the schools, and the need for    3/20/2023 2:52 PM
                        students to feel safe at school (parents feeling safe to send their students).
         556            The student behavior and lack of parent support is out of control.                                 3/20/2023 2:51 PM
         557            diversity is not the same among all communities within the county. In person learning is not       3/20/2023 2:49 PM
                        the only means to deliver instruction or receive an education. There are students that learn
                        best without the distraction of behaviors that occur in the school building.
         558            Dulaney High School, both the building and the athletic fields. A new building is needed and its   3/20/2023 2:49 PM

                       ground running; a good decision-maker; and very approachable and open-minded. I would also

                       really be broken into smaller districts.
                       The new superintendent needs to understand data and be able to use it to improve the system.

                       The superintendent needs to be an internal candidate that has taught in our BCPS classrooms 
                       as a teacher, led schools, and supervised schools. We have serious concerns about 
                       overcrowding and accurate enrollment projections. _________________________ is the only 
                       _____________ candidate that has the experience, skills, and character to be successful with

                       proficient. My class does not know the principal or our AP. I never see or hear from our
                       executive director. Meanwhile I am working from 7-7- trying to close the gaps within our class
                       data. Flying solo and it needs to stop. My 28 students and myself. Five resource teachers sit
                       in an office behind closed doors. Our school is an AVID school but neither principal or AP are
                       AVID trained. Our parents have no idea our school is an AVID school. Very very sad. We will
                       probably lose our certification this year and no one cares. (Teacher in a bcps school)

                       social justice issues regarding students and employees. BCoPS experiences a record number
                       of employees using FMLA, sick leave, and vacation time to help them maintain their own
                       mental, physical, and social well-being. These are clear indicators that employee working
                       conditions on a whole are TOXIC!!! The Superintendent must take a strong stance against
                       privatization and stop the current practice of employing individuals in temporary positions
                       beyond a 6-month duration. If more than six (6) months of service are needed, that indicates
                       the need for a full-time PERMANENT (or part-time) position with the appropriate employee
                       rights and benefits. The Superintendent should also make sure that individuals in specialty
                       areas meet all of the qualifications connected with their positions. Some current
                       administrators/supervisors are holding positions that some of the employees they supervise
                       are better qualified to hold because of skills, experience, and degrees or certifications. The
                       increases in worksite bullying and harassment need to STOP IMMEDIATELY! A concerted
                       effort should also be made to improve the physical facilities many of our students and
                       employees find themselves in currently. Some of our schools have become a sea of
                       <portables=, and some of our central office sites are over-crowded, outdated, and simply not fit
                       to house anyone. The next Superintendent should consider streamlining the overall hierarchy
                       of this school system. Too many <special= offices and departments exist that can be combined
                       in a more efficient and effective manner.

                       through a PUBLIC school system similar to BCPS. They need to have a firm grasp of the
                       challenges teachers face (by being one themselves) so they can implement rules/structure

                        have the confidence and perseverance to fight against many central office decisions.

                         consequences enforced when expectations are not met. If students violate the code of
                         conduct, they should be suspended or expelled, if warranted. There have been far too few
                         consequences for many kids over the past ten or so years.

                         by facilitating the development, articulation, implementation, and stewardship of a vision of

                         attend events fairly; ie. all high school graduations of all schools (In 2022, the superintendent
                         did not attend all graduations, citing previous commitments, like the schedule hadn't been
                         approved by the board months in advance.) We expect you to be comfortable serving a diverse
                         community and that you have experience serving in the capacity. You should be willing to

                         The new superintendent should possess strong leadership qualities that display inclusivity in 
                         diversity and change in the current world we are living in. _____________ posses these 
                         characteristics to foster the necessary changes.
                         A genuine love for children. A certain former superintendent was always photographed with

                         children, on his knees, at eye level, with a smile and genuine engagement. Kindless and 
                         Inclusiveness like ________________. _________________ is an extremely busy _____ who 
                         always has time as he passes by for a kind hello to and for anyone and everyone. A

                         and teamwork with the board and his cabinet. Board and Cabinet inclusion. Excellent listening 
                         skills.
          57             I believe that the superintendent should only bring on friends that are out for his/her good which    3/27/2023 8:55 AM
                         should be for the betterment of Baltimore County Schools. Again, it is all about accountability,
                         which I don't see now.
          58             The new superintendent needs to be a very good listener, open to compromise and building on           3/27/2023 8:39 AM
                         the specific needs of the myriad of students

                         community is essential.
          60             Knowledge of current staffing challenges to continue to maintain quality of educational               3/27/2023 8:17 AM

                         managing a budget effectively.

                         the secondary level is a joke. The kids mock it. "Equity" training seems like it is dividing staff,
                         not uniting us.

                         20 years. They need to be able to understand the needs of the teachers, staff and students in
                         BCPS. They need to stop the needless spending and hear the voices of the people working in
                         the classrooms. Staff in the higher positions are disconnected. The superintendent needs to be
                         innovative and experienced in education and special education.

                         teachers and staff of BCPS
          69             Someone who can convene and empower a leadership team to divide up the school district                  3/26/2023 8:40 PM
                         management. Someone who can advocate for/work with the county for more appropriate
                         zoning of real estate development so that enrollments are more accurately predicted. We also
                         need a superintendent who can lead us through the likely attempts of people with fascist
                         attitudes who will try to infiltrate the school board and ban books, eliminate critical thinking,
                         and provide only a narrow educational worldview.
          70             Someone who is present in the community. Someone who interacts with teachers and hears                  3/26/2023 8:07 PM
                         our needs. Someone who will get this county to work together and stop spending money on
                         nonsense.
          71             I would like to see the new Superintendent come into classrooms in Lansdowne, especially to             3/26/2023 6:18 PM
                         the middle school. For years, I thought we were a forgotten school, isolated from the rest of
                         the county. I and so many of our staff are dedicated to serving our students. Sometimes we
                         just need a kind word and a thank you.
          72             The new superintendent must be culturally competent. The person must understand the                     3/26/2023 6:14 PM
                         cultural assets of students and communities they serve and know how to move resources to
                         ensure all schools have what they need to address students' needs. It is imperative for the
                         superintendent to collaborate with each bargaining unit and provide opportunities for the voices
                         of personnel who work with students have a place at that table to ensure policies and practices
                         are helpful rather than harmful to students' learning. In addition, the person must be able to
                         gain the trust and respect of employees by leading by example.
          73             Diversity at all levels. Communication of new ideas pipeline. We need to make changes faster            3/26/2023 4:52 PM
                         for those on the front line. The teachers.
          74             School safety for all students and faculty members                                                      3/26/2023 4:28 PM
          75             -Prior experience as a superintendent or in a leadership position either in Baltimore County or         3/26/2023 4:02 PM
                         another large school district -Understanding of racial, socioeconomic, and cultural differences
                         that often create inequities -Actionable ideas that prioritize students and teachers, and plans to
                         improve school environments -Very open to input from students and staff
          76             Because our system is now majority minority I think the superintendent needs to reflect the             3/26/2023 2:59 PM
                         school community. This will be difficult as the parents don't want that. If the superintendent is
                         not a minority they must be progressive enough to fight for the change that is needed. As a
                         teacher I want someone in charge that isn't so worried about "teaching research based
                         curriculum with fidelity" and more about doing what is right and best for the students in my
                         class. This is a school system that is changing and the superintendent needs to be able to be
                         proactive in anticipating what is coming and how to adjust and not just react to what is already
                         happening.
          77             We need a focused and courageous leader who understands data, can clearly articulate our                3/26/2023 2:06 PM
                         goals, is not intimidated but inspires others to greatness. Someone who has presence, is
                         trustworthy, and is able to get things done by working with teams. Some one who has been
                         there for us and stood with us through the highs and lows. We need someone that has taught
                                                                             94 / 125

                        and be better.
          79            Know that the county is very diverse. Certain parts of the county are <redder= than others; other    3/26/2023 7:57 AM
                        parts of the county are very <blue.= The new superintendent needs to be able to
                        navigate/negotiate these differences. While certain states are in the midst of changing their

                        new superintendent should be versed in principles of diversity, equity, and inclusion. My
                        preference is that person have 10+ years of senior-level administrative experience in
                        education. We have a LARGE school system with over 100,000 students and cannot afford
                        any management.

                        improving school systems, do whatever it takes to make this a great public school system,
                        high morals, understands what the teacher curriculum entails and see what teachers are
                        dealing with, understand what parents are going through and the challenges they are dealing
                        with in the school system, understand the needs of all children and all learning styles and
                        integrate that into BCPS, and stay focused.
          92            If the superintendent is not from within the system currently, we must have a seasoned               3/25/2023 1:30 PM
                        superintendent. We are a large school system with a lot of changing needs. This requires
                        specific knowledge in knowing how to right the course of BCPS.
                                                                           95 / 125

         93             I think they should have been a teacher before to understand what is best for our children.          3/25/2023 12:54 PM
                        They should definitely have some background knowledge of special education.

         95             Real leadership and innovation is needed to move this large and diverse system forward. Our          3/25/2023 12:33 PM
                        schools need a leader who is well informed and experienced in leading with knowledge and
                        innovation, building a culture of trust, open communication, and high expectations, and who
                        can take a fresh look at where money/resources are allocated and determine where changes
                        are needed to drive true change.
         96             Principled, responsible, good work ethic (with realization that actions impact young children        3/25/2023 11:59 AM
                        everyday), active in the community

                        and their well being. Willing to do whatever is good for students.
         98             communication & transparency: these issues that we’ve seen with past superintendents, need           3/25/2023 10:51 AM
                        to be confronted, addressed and resolved by our new superintendent
         99             They can’t just be a suit with an education. We had that before and it bit us in a major way…        3/25/2023 10:42 AM
                        several times! We need someone who REALLY cares about the communities & children, not
                        just collecting a fat paycheck while the teachers, staff, bus drivers, etc put in all the work.
                        Preferably someone that was actually a teacher for a significant amount of time. So many
                        people in charge are clueless bc they never worked in the trenches.
         100            We need someone to work to bring comoentance back to BCPS. Someone to clean up the                   3/25/2023 10:26 AM
                        central offices.
         101            The superintendent should have clear expectations for administrators and the courage to              3/25/2023 10:08 AM
                        support them as long as they follow those expectations and BCPS guidelines. BCPS would
                        benefit from a superintendent that is familiar with BCPS. Promotion from within will be less
                        disruptive to this system. A candidate from within already knows the schools, communities,
                        and administrators and will not have to study the district before sound decisions are made.
         102            I feel that we need a superintendent who has the ability to ignore the "shinny" initiatives and      3/25/2023 9:17 AM
                        focus on the core problems of the school. I am looking for a superintendent who does not put
                        bandaids on bullet holes, and really addresses the problems teachers are seeing in their
                        classrooms.
         103            Integrity. Trustworthy. Represent and listen to the parents, children and teachers---NOT the         3/25/2023 9:13 AM
                        politicians. Keep our schools and communities safe. Focus on the basics of teaching and
                        learning.
         104            Flexibility and complete transparency. Creative ideas to change and decentralize                     3/25/2023 8:38 AM
         105            Strong communicator as well as listener. Possess servant leadership qualities. Ability to be         3/25/2023 6:12 AM
                        accountable to results, errors and feedback without being defensive. Transparent operational
                        style and accessible.
         106            Be in the parents side. Listen and really hear. They are responsible for their children's safety     3/25/2023 5:45 AM
                        and well being
         107            The new superintendent should NOT be a shameless self-promoter. The job is about our kids,           3/25/2023 12:10 AM
                        not them. I am tired of the position being used as a stepping stone for something bigger. Do
                        the job and make the tough decisions and STOP doing the job with a foot out the door and
                        your thumb on the speed dial of your publicist. Please hire a superintendent that does not feel
                        compelled to hire their friends, fraternity brothers, or sorority sisters who cannot do the job! Too
                        many people are hired who are clueless but are FOS (Friend Of the Super) then they are
                        protected, promoted, and supported but should NOT and should NEVER have been put in the
                        job in the first place. Too much time is lost "getting acquainted" with the area. The new person
                        should know that morale is down, scores are down, violence is up and out of control, and too
                        many students are not prepared for college or the workforce upon graduation BCPS has
                        become a diploma mill where the diploma means nothing because they do not hold anyone
                        accountable, they do not fail anyone, and they pass students because they do not want to be
                                                                          96 / 125

                       looked at as a failure. Now BCPS is emptying the school and sending underprepared kids to
                       the Community College because they have failed them and do not want to deal with them.
         108           New superintendent should support and promote classical/traditional education                     3/24/2023 8:12 PM
         109           Should be someone from the county who attended schools here. Someone who has been a               3/24/2023 7:52 PM
                       teacher in the classroom from at least 10 years. They should be non political and not in the
                       pockets of extreme groups like Moms for Liberty. They should be willing to visit schools and
                       listen to students. They should be open minded and understand the importance of education
                       for all students. They should also be supportive of teachers and principals. They should be
                       sure that parents are held accountable snd students who cannot succeed in the classroom
                       have somewhere to go where they can succeed and those who do not wish to be in school
                       provided other opportunities.
         110           The new superintendent needs to stop things that are not working and begin to fix the things      3/24/2023 6:37 PM
                       that need to be fixed so that students can be successful. Be supportive of the teachers so that
                       BCPS can stop losing them.

                       instruction a slave to technology • be able to address crises, but should also anticipate crisis
                       and avoid them (not just covid-we consider the school violence and unstable environments to
                       be a crisis) • have a plan 3 not just some vague mission 3 that doesn’t equal achievement;
                       anyone can point to the end of a road or a positive goal, but you need someone who has the

                       and evaluates their performance • A great superintendent is flexible. He or she needs to be 
                       able to manage the politics of the job 3 to adapt to new board members, changes in state 
                       funding and changes in the school community while not sacrificing the district’s vision. A great

         121           Experience: #1 Years of experience in the classroom. (In the trenches) #2 Years as an             3/24/2023 2:11 PM
                       administrator in a school #3 Years as a successful superintendent in a large school district. No
                       political ambition… and not connected with a political party. We had one like that… it did not
                       go well. A willingness to listen to parents, students, teachers, and community members. I
                       remember a superintendent several years ago who did a survey about starting school before or
                       after Labor Day. The public responded overwhelmingly for After Labor Day. The next school
                       year BCPS started after Labor Day. Unfortunately this was quickly reversed by the next
                       superintendent who never listened to the <stake holders.=
         122           1) Humility. This is not a position to boost your ego. You have to want to help 110K+ kids, the
                                                                                                                         3/24/2023 1:52 PM
                       teachers, and the community. This should give you such an amazing feeling of
                       accomplishment when you do. 2) Ability to listen. You can't understand the problems without
                       listening to those around you. 3) Ability to travel. We are a large county geographically. Make
                       sure to take the time to listen and hear what those at the edges say. 4) Don't be afraid of
                       innovation. Too much is focused on metrics and tests. Inspire the kids and teachers, and the
                       community and the rest will follow. But make sure it's actionable and not just hype.
         123           1. Collaboration - we (teachers, principals, paraeducators, office staff, building service workers)
                                                                                                                         3/24/2023 1:42 PM
                       have a lot to offer and we want to help! To build trust, it's imperative we be involved in
                       processes like creating the budget and giving feedback on curriculum and new initiatives in a
                       meaningful way. Please come with the value of using our tremendous expertise, rather than
                       trying to outsource or work around us. 2. Trust - trust principals to lead and teachers to teach.
                       3. Honesty - trust in BCPS central office among employees is very low. We want to feel like
                       our leadership really cares about us and our work, and is willing to invest resources and care in
                       our success. 4. Visionary, but not people pleaser - a bold vision can upset some people. We
                       need someone who will take a clear-eyed look at our administrative central office procedures
                       and make overhauls where needed, even if this means shuffling around or replacing higher-
                       ups. 5. Experience with community schools 6. No corruption or conflicts of interest 7.

         126            I would hope that the new superintendent would actually care and be concerned for the kids        3/24/2023 12:07 PM
                        and not cater to political views or pressures from outside of the kids and parents.
         127            The superintendent needs to be known by the children. Yes, the parents and administrators are     3/24/2023 11:42 AM
                        important but the children should know who they are and be able to communicate with them.
         128            Community oriented; staff, student and parent friendly; 21st Century Forward thinking.            3/24/2023 10:01 AM
         129            The new Superintendent should be an inspirational leader, engaging parents, students and          3/24/2023 9:57 AM
                        teachers to do their best and then do more. That person should also be a consensus builder,
                        bringing together groups with conflicting interests to determine how BCPS can server
                        everyone's interests. To accomplish that, the new superintendent should regularly and routinely
                        call on parent and community leaders from different parts of the County to learn from each
                        other and reject the notion that what is best for my community is what is best for the entire
                        County. We are too diverse for a "one size fits all" approach.
         130            Their soul purpose should be to educate, support and prepare our children for their future. That  3/24/2023 9:56 AM
                        should guide each and every decision. Our teachers should be supported and recieve as much
                        assistance as possible as their job only seems to become more and more difficult.
         131            Openness to <outside of the box= programs and curricula                                           3/24/2023 9:42 AM
         132            A candidate for Superintendent should have roots in the county they represent. STOP HIRING        3/24/2023 9:19 AM
                        FROM OUT OF STATE. A candidate should be resident of the county or reside with 25 miles
                        of the county they will be in charge of, and have lived in the area for a minimum of 5 years.
         133            Involved and invested. Visible in schools. Classroom experience recently and a desire to stay     3/24/2023 9:10 AM
                        involved in classroom and with teachers.
         134            The new superintendent should be transparent, open to suggestions, will to talk and listen to     3/24/2023 8:25 AM
                        the parents/stakeholders, focus on the basics of education and not have a political agenda.
                        Parents should have a larger say in the education of their children and we need a leader that
                        understands that. The new superintendent needs to have a passion for the job and not just
                        want to claim a six figure salary at the cost of our children's education. The superintendent
                        needs to get BCPS's focus back on the basics math, reading, writing, history (the way it
                        happened) and life skills. Kids need to learn how to function and survive in life and as an
                        educational system BCPS is failing our kids at this point. BCPS needs to focus more on daily
                        learning and lessons and less on national and quarterly testing.
         135            The new superintendent should be a woman or man with a history in Baltimore County. We            3/24/2023 7:35 AM
                        need someone that lives in Baltimore County. They need to be transparent and address the
                        hard questions. They need to understand communities. They need to work for our teachers and
                        students, not our politicians.
         136            A true understanding of diversity, equity, and inclusion and tangible ways this will be           3/24/2023 7:22 AM
                        implemented.
         137            Be on the level of the teachers, be realistic in what you ask, know your audience. Listen to the  3/24/2023 7:20 AM
                        teachers and parents. Interact with your schools on a personal level.
         138            We need to get real about discipline. Students aren't held accountable for not only their grades  3/24/2023 7:16 AM
                        but also their behavior. We will lose a lot of teachers who are tired of seeing violence and are
                        tired of being cussed out. Fix the student discipline or find ways for violent offenders to take
                        their courses online--we know the online thing works.
         139            Have intimate knowledge of BCPS to be able to hit the round running. A strong background in       3/24/2023 7:02 AM
                        curriculum and Special Education, and English Learners is critical.
         140            We need someone who can collaborate and lead. Listening to those at the building level to         3/24/2023 6:59 AM
                        understand how decisions are impacting teachers and students and making decisions based
                        on what is best for learning is necessary. We also need someone who is transparent about
                        what decisions are being made and can have difficult conversations. Transparency within the
                                                                         99 / 125

                        budgetary process is also extremely important. There is a great deal of money being budgeted
                        for categories of spending with little accountability for how it is being used.

         153            Direct communication. Focusing on prevention strategies for violence. Just as much focus on        3/23/2023 6:42 PM
                        consequences for bad decisions. The superintendent will stand behind those that uphold the
                        rules, even with push back from parents that do not hold their child accountable. So many
                        parents are feeling unsafe sending our kids to school.
                        Our new Superintendent has to be engaging with our communities, our schools, and our staff.

                        Our current Superintendent always made time to be with students, staff, and families. 
                        _____________________ always met with all bargaining unions and kept open communication. 
                        We want our new Superintendent to continue to have that open-door policy to meet with ALL 
                        5 bargaining unions. To be politically savvy.
         155            Commitment to whole child development, ability to communicate well, a good money manager           3/23/2023 5:41 PM
                        that will ensure funds benefit the students, a strong advocate for well qualified teachers who
                        should not be beholden to teaching to a test. Experienced with conflict resolution to reduce
                        fighting in some of these schools.
         156
                        Friendly, flexible, yet understandable. Reasonable yet stern. Decisive. Great communication.       3/23/2023 5:29 PM
                        Visibility within the schools throughout the county.
         157            We need a superintendent who can demonstrate sincerity and be approachable to all                  3/23/2023 5:23 PM
                        stakeholders. Transparency and honest communication are also essential in rebuilding trust.
         158            Good communicator. Good listener. Good at analyzing feedback from teachers/schools. Good           3/23/2023 5:23 PM
                        at supporting teachers with providing alternative placement for student who cannot
                        successfully learning a MS environment.
         159            The new superintendent needs to understand the plight of educators. It is not that we are off      3/23/2023 5:05 PM
                        for 2 months of summer. We do not get paid unless we find summer employment. During the
                        school year, staff shortages heavily way on other teachers/staff members causing mental and
                        physical stress. School system staff need and are owed a living wage. Our day and time from
                        our families and ourselves is invaluable. Educators (teachers and paraprofessionals) work
                        many hours after contract time.

                        education. Be in schools. Be transparent. Listen to teachers and staff in the buildings when
                        making decisions. Decisions should not be made by suits.

                        educator input, connection to communities, training in diversity/equity practices
          165           Baltimore County is a large area and the range of services can differ. A new Superintendent           3/23/2023 3:50 PM
                        should be comfortable visiting classrooms from all areas of the County, listen the concerns of
                        students, Teachers, Parents and Stakeholders to provide solutions.
          166           Communicative decision maker, inclusive of the community and the population they serve                3/23/2023 3:49 PM
          167           To be able to connect with the community.                                                             3/23/2023 3:43 PM
          168           I feel very strongly that the candidate that comes into BCPS should be a native or current            3/23/2023 3:38 PM
                        resident of Maryland. Our population of students and families is so diverse and span a wide
                        array of socio-economic backgrounds that it is vital to our students education that the
                        superintendent understand their diverse experiences and considers their needs. Our new
                        superintendent should have a passion for students with special needs, students' needs and
                        learning loss after the pandemic, as well as moving all students forward in their
                        social/emotional skills. By focusing our educational plans on our most at risk students, we will
                        move all our students forward. I, personally, would like to find a superintendent that has a heart
                        for students with disabilities. Providing them with a quality education within Baltimore County
                        across various degrees of learning environments is always at the forefront of my mind and it is
                        what seems to be the first thing that is consolidated. I understand the why for this initiative as
                        it is so hard to find qualified special educators and retain them, but I think as a county we
                        should start to move towards training all teachers to be better qualified for students with
                        disabilities and how we can support them across the county. If our future superintendent made
                        students with disabilities, and their families, a priority in their agenda, they would most likely
                        have my vote. I also feel our superintendent should be consistent. BCPS has a history of
                        starting new initiatives and for one reason or another changing plans, curriculum, or policies
                        without much time for implementation. As a new superintendent I would hope they will take
                        feedback from various stakeholders, invite current BCPS members to be a part of their
                        cabinet, and set a core list of goals they would like to work on during their tenure. Ideally this
                        person would adopt our current vision, The Compass, and adapt many of the current goals we
                        have set through our previous superintendent. Then based on data, I would hope this new
                        superintendent can articulate changes necessary to meet our goals.
          169           Good person with proven track record on educational side. Must be free from any allegations.          3/23/2023 3:30 PM
          170           A new superintendent should have a minimum of 10 years of actual pre-K-12 teaching                    3/23/2023 3:29 PM
                        experience and should be prepared for the difficult conversations that are necessary to solve
                        problems. This candidate should not be in the habit of making excuses, but of listening to
                        stakeholders and should be willing to accept suggestions from the "boots on the ground".
          171           I think the new superintendent should have a strong backbone and a thick skin. He or she              3/23/2023 3:27 PM
                        should be able to communicate clearly while also accepting responsibility for any mistakes.
          172           Strong interpersonal skills. Open to meeting with faculty and having round table conversations        3/23/2023 2:52 PM
                        about problems only frontline Faculty know about.
          173           They should have to take a social, mental health corse so they can understand some of the             3/23/2023 2:48 PM
                        problems with the kids. They must really care and want to be the change, the future for our
                        children.
                                                                           101 / 125

          177           Effective and collaborative decision making. We have for too long been under leadership that          3/23/2023 1:57 PM
                        is reluctant to make a firm decision or makes a snap decision without considereing the

          183           They need to be someone who has shown they can be a changemaker. Someone who can                      3/23/2023 1:43 PM

          185           We need a superintendent who communicates with us in a transparent manner. I have not seen            3/23/2023 1:38 PM
                        our current superintendent in-person, only pictures of him on the bcps website and once during
                        a meeting. I want to see our superintendent and talk with them. We also need a superintendent
                        who will make changes to help at the foundational level and not just putting out a new
                        initiatives without direction or follow-up.

                        are taking the money away from the students and schools. After that, all the problems will be

                        superint. who is comfortable with serving schools where the student body is predominantly
                        Black, rural and predom. white and schools that are under-funded. I want a superint.
                        experienced in fiscal administration, one who will work toward equity across the schools and
                        ensure children have access to resources and tech. The next superint. should have experience
                        in learning about and practicing DEIA.

          190           Good listener. Integrity. excellent systems manager4or effective delegator. An advocate to            3/23/2023 1:17 PM
                        county council for measures to reduce overcrowding. Willing to devolve many centralized
                        responsibilities to the regional areas.
          191           He needs to be in charge of the school system and not bow down to people who have been                3/23/2023 1:16 PM
                        here. He should have a strong sense of what belongs in the curriculum and what is not
                        necessary.
          192           Needs to be able to work with our BOE (even if it just means putting them in their place).            3/23/2023 1:16 PM
                        Needs to get this student behavior under control. Needs to rotate principals -many become
                        dictators in their schools. We do a lot of studies about building conditions and solutions to
                        overcrowding, but no one wants to follow the recommendations or make the hard decisions if
                        there is pushback. Sometimes you need a leader to decide what is best for everyone, not just
                        the Northeast or Central area parents. They need to hire qualified people to fill upper-level staff
                        and our school principals, not someone's best friend or people who have never worked in a

                        presentation then feeding hungry students). Principals who have never taught in a classroom
                        are not really helpful running a school. The superintendent needs to be out in our schools
                        seeing what is going on without prior notification to the school and they need to hang out for a
                        while (not just a 10-15 minute drive through). There are great things and some bad things
                        happening in our schools and we need to have someone who can make Baltimore County
                        Public Schools great again.
         193            She needs to be a good communicator. Decisions need to be tried and decided on before                3/23/2023 1:16 PM
                        notifying the public. Our new candidate needs to listen to what teachers are saying as we are
                        the people on the front lines. Our new leader needs to focus on recruiting teachers and keeping
                        good quality teachers. Too many teachers are leaving the profession and keeping them starts
                        with a quality leader.
         194            Should have sympathetic mindset. Should not attach to any political party. It is education, not      3/23/2023 1:14 PM

         204            Many, but one that I would like to see is someone who is invested in making our schools              3/23/2023 12:58 PM
                        "greener" and incorporating that into student learning...whether that's outdoor education, trash
                        clean-up around the school, composting, using natural materials whenever possible, etc.
         205            Leave the BS at the door. Our new superintendent should have a background in actual                  3/23/2023 12:57 PM
                        teaching. They should have worked their way up through the trenches and respected among
                        their peers. Leave the ego and BS at the door. Be HERE and not use BCPS as a stepping
                        stone for political office or other gain.
         206            Data-driven, keeps students first, and can navigate a contentious board. Can navigate the            3/23/2023 12:57 PM
                        politics of the county and the county executive because the money for BCPS is given by the
                        county executive.
         207            They should understand the BCPS system and the communities involved. The superintendent              3/23/2023 12:51 PM
                        should have experiencing addressing achievement and opportunity gaps, managing large
                        budgets and organizing large system work. This person should know how to select other
                        leaders so that each division or department can be lead by people who know what they are
                                                                          103 / 125

                        decline in our community and schools should receive the job if possible. Our last few
                        superintendents have been criminals, negligent, out of touch, and self-serving. We need
                        someone who taught in a classroom for an extended period of time.
         209            The new superintendent should be accessible, relatable, personable, and come with more               3/23/2023 12:48 PM
                        classroom experience than any other experience. They should welcome innovative ideas,
                        encourage schools to take initiatives to address their own issues, provide funding to schools
                        who suffer from inequities, and offer praise, commendations, support, and incentives to retain
                        highly qualified educators. We don't need another leader who encourages other leaders to
                        criticize and demoralize teachers and other other educators in an attempt to produce results.
                        We need a leader with woo and who can lead his team in a way that fosters high morale for

                        schools, should be familiar with working in a school, with students. Many ideas that are
                        pushed down from the top by well-intentioned administrators who are not experienced in the
                        classroom (in recent years), are not at all practical or what's best for students. Curriculum
                        writers should have to spend time in classrooms, so that students can be appropriately
                        challenged, but not overwhelmed. Topics should be interesting and age-appropriate.

                        contributing citizens in the 21st century. Baltimore County Government and BCPS need to
                        work together to address the urgency of climate change and to promote sustainable growth and
                        development within our schools and communities.

                        love a private school education but it may be unattainable. We still deserve the best education
                        possible. Not a 2/10 graded school such as Randallstown Elementary.

         234            The new superintendent needs to be a "people" person and be able to communicate with all          3/22/2023 7:24 PM
                        members of BCPS. They need to be honest and compassionate. They need to be innovative
                        and willing to try new things, and open to change when they realize that the current way of
                        doing things is not working. I think the new superintendent should have been a teacher at
                        some point in their career to be able to understand all aspects of the school system, either
                        coming from a student's or Teacher's perspective.

         241            The superintendent needs to be a bridge. A bridge between parents and teachers; between our         3/22/2023 3:07 PM
                        schools and public officials and politicians. This person needs to be a motivator and bring

                        demonstrated excellence in management and fiscal responsibility. This person should be

         245            The new superintendent should be someone that have genuine love for all children, and for           3/22/2023 1:48 PM
                        their individuality. This person should be interested in helping each child reach higher than their

                        management of the system.
         256            The new superintendent will need to be able to deal with a divisive board, entitled communities     3/22/2023 10:53 AM
                        - and communities that don't represent themselves, and staff who have become accustomed

         257            The next Super will need a strong backbone to put kids first and make decisions that benefit        3/22/2023 10:08 AM
                        children - not developers - not Central office employees - not TABCO and unions - not
                        contracts with questionable situations surrounding them - kids and their academics FIRST.
                        BCPS needs a strong leader whose top priority must be the mission of the school system - to
                        EDUCATE. Academic Achievement and PROOF of measurable, large gains over short periods
                                                                         106 / 125

                        of time are critical. Our current leadership - especially in the immediate levels down from the
                        Super surrounding academics - refuse to take responsibility for assuring what decisions are
                        made at Central are implemented in schools. This absolutely must change and there needs to
                        be a "house clearing" of these critical positions that have been held by individuals who are not
                        willing to do the hard work of holding our schools, principals, and teachers accountable to
                        results. The Super needs to come in with a team of doers - those with high expectations of
                        staff and students, who will implement best practices - not make excuses for lack of them and
                        who want to be accountable. DO NOT hire from within or from the past. Look forward. We need
                        a whole NEW focus and trajectory. BCPS needs new life, new ideas, new focus, and new hope
                        that we can turn things around. We are not going to get that from past or current employees.
                        Candidate must show a history of using evidence-based instruction and not be afraid to make
                        waves in schools and amongst staff to be sure debunked methods are not being used - unlike
                        today where we (in classrooms) continue to promote and use methods of teaching that do not
                        align with how the brain learns. Candidate should be open to input but firm in conviction of the
                        need for schools to be places of learning as priority one.
         258            listen to key officials and community members, but always act in the interest of students first      3/22/2023 9:43 AM

                        related to DEI and SEL) recognize the role of technology in education, but not make instruction
                        a slave to technology be able to address crises, but should also anticipate crisis and avoid
                        them (not just covid-we consider the school violence and unstable environments to be a crisis)
                        have a plan 3 not just some vague mission 3 that doesn’t equal achievement; anyone can
                        point to the end of a road or a positive goal, but you need someone who has the sense of
                        direction on how to get there must maintain effective communication with community, not just
                        press releases and talk about what is so great under his or her leadership He or she is
                        knowledgeable of the best practices for maximizing student achievement and is supportive of
                        teachers in the district A great superintendent is an effective communicator. He or she must
                        make a concerted effort to communicate the needs and accomplishments of the district in a
                        variety of formats: through written reports, communication with the media, public meetings and
                        attendance at school events A great superintendent is a good manager. He or she directs the
                        administrators to accomplish the goals of the district, monitors their progress and evaluates
                        their performance A great superintendent is flexible. He or she needs to be able to manage the
                        politics of the job 3 to adapt to new board members, changes in state funding and changes in
                        the school community while not sacrificing the district’s vision. A great superintendent takes a
                        collaborative rather than a confrontational approach
         259            Administration background, education mandatory, social worker, or psych degree                       3/22/2023 9:08 AM

                        type, someone to sort the bs out, someone with integrity, perseverance, peace and joy about
                        them but who is willing to put the hours the money whatever to improve our schools!!
         260            We need someone who hasn't forgotten what it is like to be a classroom teacher, and                  3/22/2023 9:06 AM
                        understands the complex requirements and pressures of the job. We need someone willing to
                        fight to fund the schools. We need someone who recognizes that the schools take care of the
                        whole child, and is willing to put social workers, guidance counselors, SEL staff, etc. in the
                        schools. You can't teach children if their basic needs aren't met, and, whether it is fair or not,
                        this has fallen to the schools. We need someone who can broker partnerships with
                        organizations that can prop up/enrich our students, like the BSO.
         261            The new superintendent should be non-political. He or she should not be in the job to promote        3/22/2023 8:51 AM
                        an ideologies of the teacher association or any political party. The superintendent should only
                        be concerned with the success of each child by doing what is truly best for them, even if that
                        means a bit of tough love and consequences for actions deemed inappropriate. The bar should
                        be set high, so that student's have something to reach for, rather than coast on. Someone with
                        the intention of actually caring enough for the individual to know that treating everyone the
                        same in a inclusive environment, may actually hinder rather than help. Sometimes what a
                        student needs is extra attention or discipline to succeed. We are also forgetting the average
                        student too often. The GT and special education student's often get the attention, leaving the
                        massive amount of general ed students to fend for themselves.
         262            Advanced knowledge of learning differences, special education, and IDEA. A desire to hold the        3/22/2023 8:22 AM
                        system accountable to the needs of students (will not cover up mistakes.) Honesty and
                        transparency. Outside-the-box thinking on how to reappropriate funds and reduce waste to
                        revamp our system.

                        car ride or dismissal and cleanup duty time. A VLP superintendent will make sure teachers are
                        professionals and accept constructive criticism, suggestions and recommendations from the
                        community that clearly have hopes for a brighter, better, stronger, more efficient and productive

                       academic failures.
         282           The new superintendent needs to be candid and truthful. They need to address the concerns of    3/21/2023 6:53 PM
                       violence in our schools. There needs to be accountability in place for children that commit
                       violence that goes beyond social emotional learning. The new superintendent needs to be able
                       to draft a plan with real consequences for the violent students. Additionally, the new
                       superintendent needs to be able to pinpoint the reason for the decline in academics. They
                       must not use the pandemic as an excuse. No one wants excuses. We want results. The new
                       superintendent needs to get Baltimore County Public Schools as a top program again where
                       parents are proud to send their children. The new superintendent needs to recognize that our
                       schools are below par and needs the gumption to make the necessary changes to make our
                       schools better.

                        Our next superintendent needs to be available to staff and actually speak to them about their
                        realities. Staff, students, and community members want to see their superintendent and know

                        to feel accepted.
          318           I feel the superintendent should focus on ways to improve the skills of teachers so they could        3/21/2023 11:26 AM
                        impact knowledge in a more easy manner
          319           Stand for honesty, courage to go against the democrat machine. Put students first.                    3/21/2023 11:21 AM
          320
                        Consider actual teacher feedback (not just TABCO. They seem to have their own agenda) Be              3/21/2023 11:16 AM
                        involved and communicate.
          321           Someone who has been a classroom teacher in the past 3 years. Someone who values                      3/21/2023 11:10 AM
                        student (and teacher) wellbeing over appearances and data points.
          322           Visionary, strong leadership, compassion                                                              3/21/2023 11:08 AM
          323           Open minded, detail oriented, bit of a dreamer, tech savvy, good listener and observant.              3/21/2023 10:57 AM
          324           I formly believe our new superintendent should have historical and institutional knowledge of         3/21/2023 10:53 AM
                        our school system. A candidate who already has experience working in Baltimore County
                        Public Schools is CRITICAL to our success. There are deep rooted issues that we have
                        experienced these past 4 years specifically that an external candidate would take too long to
                        try to understand and fix.
          325           The new superintendent should be someone who is familiar with BCPS so s/he does not need              3/21/2023 10:43 AM
                        to spend extensive amounts of time learning how things work.
          326           Build relationships with everyone. Meet with families, teachers, staff. Encourage                     3/21/2023 10:40 AM
                        administrators to build relationships with the community.
          327           Open minded, accepting of our diverse population, supportive of teachers and administrators.          3/21/2023 10:18 AM

                       and County Council. - Must have experience as both a teacher and an administrator, ideally in
                       areas that serve families with a higher SES and lower SES in order to truly understand the
                       differing demands. Someone who was only in the classroom for a few years does not have a
                       true understanding of the demands placed on educators. - Experience related to special
                       education or mental health services would be a bonus, given current climate in regard to both
                       student mental health/behavior and special ed services/demands. - Their ethics and honesty
                       must be beyond reproach. The climate of distrust toward the superintendent and school board
                       will take time to repair, and will require someone who is transparent in his/her interactions.

                       figurehead. More engaged with parents groups also is important.
         333           A new superintendent should have knowledge of our school system and our communities. It           3/21/2023 9:39 AM

         342           The new superintendent should be a partner in the schools. This person should be in the           3/21/2023 8:46 AM
                       trenches working with us. The new superintendent should be fair and talk to the teachers to

                        money should benefit the schools directly. Every superintendent wants to bring their own staff
                        in newly created positions. Put the prior administration BACK into the schools and stop
                        creating these positions. The new superintendent should be able to make the hard decisions

                        Fix the image of the schools. Invest in more afterschool programs where paraprofessionals or
                        other teachers (get paid to) help students with homework/studying. Focus more intentionnally
                        on Social/Emotional learning. The kids are still struggling through what happened with
                        COVID19. Foster a community of invested stakeholders, including students, families,

                        priority in every decision he makes. He should use an equity lens to teach solve problems and
                        he should respect people from diverse backgrounds. Respect everyone regardless of their
                        background and or culture, religion, race, socio-economic status. Have a clear vision, with a
                        plan of how things will be done. The new superintendent should be proactive, and collaborative
                        and open to feedback. This person should be transformational, a change agent, and
                        courageous enough to monitor and make effective changes that will benefit all.

                         people in schoolhouses. Finally, the superintendent needs to empower employees rather than
                         be an autocrat. Decisions need to be by consensus rather than unilateral. In essence their
                         values need to match their actions. The stakeholders of BCPS do not believe the system
                         because there is a disconnect between what it says it is and reality. Finally, the superintendent
                         needs to recognize and account for disparities between schools in different geographical areas
                         of the county.
          365            Superintendent must be a strong communicator with administrative and teaching experience.             3/21/2023 7:20 AM
                         Candidates must also possess a strong passion for childhood development and true care for
                         children.
          366            Stop making excuses for students. I understand that Covid had a negative impact on students.          3/21/2023 7:18 AM
                         However, we had behavior issues way before Covid. Please come up with a solution to remove
                         students from the classroom who have had too many chances and who are ruining learning for
                         everyone else. Please stand up for the teachers and administrators who are working hard to
                         have a safe environment. Please be transparent, communicate effectively and help make our
                         schools safe for ALL students.
          367            I realize that the superintendent has a lot of stakeholders, but never forget that the students       3/21/2023 7:18 AM
                         come first. Listen to their feedback, they are your clients. Please don't cave to the latest
                         educational fads, woke interests, or union pressures. Education is about learning, not testing.
                         Finally, please use technology appropriately. Families don't need robo-calls wishing us happy

                         requests/issues.
          370            The new superintendent should have roots in Baltimore County. He/she should understand how            3/21/2023 7:15 AM
                         to cultivate and maintain relationships throughout the organization and within County and State
                         government. He/she should be knowledgable,decisive, and a clear communicator. He/she
                         should embrace highly talented staff and work in partenrship with them, not be threatened by
                         them. .
          371            the ability to unite people, appreciative of our staff, students, and community, present in the       3/21/2023 7:13 AM
                         schools, willing to acknowledge mistakes, transparent
          372            We are hoping for full transparency and a superintendent that will actually listen, actually react,   3/21/2023 7:12 AM
                         and actually respond to all stakeholders in a thoughtful, meaningful, and respectful way. The
                         candidate should be respectful of all BCPS employees and understand what employees' day-
                         by-day routines are like and understand the challenges that sometimes pop up. They should
                         also do as they say and be truthful to all involved (parents, students, employees).

          375            Student centered, education centered, behavioral support centered... Technology has a place           3/21/2023 6:59 AM
                         in education, but should not take the place of solid teaching. It should not be a distraction.
                         Forcing through technology based 'everything' in place of learning to work with peers is not
                         developmentally appropriate for many of our students.
          376            A belief that all students can succeed but that they must be held accountable. Personable,            3/21/2023 6:48 AM
                         fair, a supporter of parents and teachers, and someone who has run a large, urban school
                         system and had success (that last one will be hard to find - we have had little luck with our
                         previous administration).
                                                                           114 / 125

          377            Take a look further in to what the VLP has accomplished for the students in program.                  3/21/2023 6:39 AM
                         Reconsider keeping the program as an open option for all students in middle and high school
                         who would like to attend and are capable of working in a virtual setting.
          378            They will need to be diversified in their thinking and also forward thinking. They need to be able    3/21/2023 6:30 AM
                         to know ALL of the people and departments that work for them as employees and understand
                         their challenges. They need to be able to listen to the employees who actually work in the jobs
                         for the school and learn from them the challenges and successes. It is the employees who are
                         actually doing the job who know better than anyone what is good for the schools and the
                         students than anyone else would or could know. They need to believe in the employee who has
                         a complaint or an issue with another employee's behavior or unfair management. Women
                         especially within the central offices are not always taken seriously. Many times they are just
                         seen as "help".
          379            The new superintendent needs to be brave enough to stand up and say that there will be                3/21/2023 6:17 AM
                         consequences for misbehavior. We need to use in-school suspension, out of school
                         suspension, night school and alternative schools. Students have learned that they will not be
                         held accountable for their behavior by the school system and so they misbehave.
          380            Should be passionate about the job and care about everyone involved.                                  3/21/2023 6:15 AM
          381            Honest, realistic, hard working, knowledgeable about special education and equity.                    3/21/2023 6:12 AM
          382            Open to change and reaching out to other school districts that are excelling and seek to              3/21/2023 6:06 AM
                         improve old outdated processes. Look at pre-school support and schools with behavioral
                         issues get them the resources to turn things around. Open to new ways of learning and
                         updated technology.
          383            Be invested-you might come from another city-but treat it as your home-as if your own children        3/21/2023 6:04 AM
                         go here. Please don't treat this as a career move-and more of a way to make a positive
                         change. We could use someone who is invested and cares.
          384            Honesty. Integrity. Hard working. Realistic. Equity minded.                                           3/21/2023 6:00 AM
          385            I would like to see a superintendent that genuine cares for the children and community. I would       3/21/2023 5:47 AM
                         like to see fewer political aspirations and more improvement of the learning environment.
          386            I want our new superintendent focused on creating and ensuring a safe environment for                 3/21/2023 5:44 AM
                         learning. Our new superintendent should focus on creating rigorous instructional outcomes and
                         practices so that each child can reach their potential. They should be aware of the latest
                         research and willing to make change to help students learn and grow.
          387            Be the face of the school system and be AVAIALABLE we haven’t had that for years.                     3/21/2023 4:39 AM

          389            An effective superintendent would be well versed in all areas of the education process. He or         3/20/2023 11:55 PM

                        allowed to teach their children about faith, gender, sexuality, relationships etc. Also, parents
                        would like to have a day in books and materials used in the curriculum and be able to vote on
                        what they feel is best for their children. Also, this individual should have excellent

                        person needs to get rid of the upper level people and get people and money in the school

                        have different learning needs. The one-size fits all model no longer works. A faith in the next
                        generation with some optimism.
         417            The superintendent should be hired from within BCPS. We have plenty of people such as               3/20/2023 7:16 PM
                        current administrators who have intimate knowledge of the strengths and weaknesses in our
                        current system. Please hire someone who has taught in our schools and knows the needs.
                        BCPS desperately needs leadership that understands us and not an outsider. Please do not
                        hire out of state!

                        such as: 1. Inclusive practices in teaching and learning that promote success for students 2.
                        Disincentivize or discourage exclusionary practices in schools
         419            Flexible. Excellent leadership. Fair and open to suggestions. Impartial. Resourceful. Active        3/20/2023 7:06 PM
                        and present. Organized. Able to rely people together.
         420            I would hope our new superintendent is not just using us as a steppingstone but is truly            3/20/2023 7:05 PM
                        invested in our communities, staff and students. Stop viewing our staff as an expendable
                        commodity. We are the reason schools are safe, supporting havens for our students.

                        deficiencies.
         422            An extreme desire to not only help the students but the staff. Honesty with the families is also    3/20/2023 6:56 PM
                        important. Commitment to student safety.
         423            The new Superintendent, needs to have much better leadership. Knowledge. Understand the             3/20/2023 6:55 PM
                        teachers an students. Make sure you take care of the needs of the school staff and students.
                        Lunches need to be better in the schools. Put back snacks. Put back juices. When I went to
                        school. We had snacks an juice. Candy, cookies, cakes. They eat it at home. A lot of students
                        are not fond of the lunches they serve. To me they look like that it was thrown together. Please
                        get better food for the kids.
         424            Our next superintendent should be a professional communicator. They should be able to adapt         3/20/2023 6:52 PM
                        to a variety of different communities who's needs are different. They should be innovative and

                        within schools. Love this as a career and not just a job. Imagine if they child was apart of this
                        community, and how they would want more for their child.
         428            Communication, honesty, morales, transparency. Parent themselves.                                   3/20/2023 6:31 PM

         432            The superintendent should be decisive. The superintendent should acknowledge the                    3/20/2023 6:10 PM
                                                                         117 / 125

                         significance of teachers and prioritize their retention and concerns because we are on the front
                         lines every single day. THe superintendent needs to have a strong academic background (early
                         childhood training would be amazing) with the ability to communicate this to a Board of Ed that
                         is largely comprised of non-educators. Take care of the teachers so they can take care of the
                         students. Parents and community stakeholders should come after the two groups directly
                         impacted on a daily basis.
          433            I believe it’s time for BCPS to find its superintendent from within its own ranks. Bringing in         3/20/2023 6:07 PM
                         individuals from other systems has simply failed. We have many outstanding and qualified
                         leaders within the central offices and executive leadership. These individuals know the needs
                         of the students and schools. They know what has worked and what has not. BCPS needs a
                         leader that is transparent, communicates successes and struggles effectively with all
                         stakeholders including local media outlets and one that does not fall into the trap of branding
                         over reality. BCPS needs a leader that is truly invested in equity and boosting the achievement
                         of all students rather than just by saying the right things. We need a leader that is willing to
                         hold all stakeholders accountable.

          445            I think intelligence and kindness are important for all jobs. For superintendent I think some          3/20/2023 5:16 PM
                         extra qualities are very important: resourcefulness, flexibility, patience, and ability to
                         improvise. I think those are needed to tackle all the challenges, both the expected ones and
                         the surprises.

                         willing to make policies based on individual schools instead of as an entire county. I think it is
                         most important for a candidate to be deferential to the administrations at each individual
                         school, who know the needs and desires of their school community best.
                                                                            118 / 125

          451            The new Superintendent should be an internal candidate. That would help this system move                3/20/2023 5:05 PM
                         forward and there is no lag time in learning the system or processes; possess empathy; does
                         what's best for the system, not just for themselves; bridge the divide among parents, students,
                         stakeholders, and staff.

                         in letting go of weak Principal’s and find one's that are truly qualified. Treat all BCPS
                         employees with respect and dignity no matter what their position. Talk to staff and see how
                         they feel, and don't rely on Admin. to tell you about morale.

                         stand up to special interests and focus on serving the entire school system. While having a
                         strong personality, the Superintendent should also be able to engage and work with various
                         interest groups since these are key to a successful tenure. I would like to see a person who
                         cares more about the overall development, happiness and safety of students than with test
                         scores.

                       school experience have no concept of what we do. I’d also like someone who when they visit
                       the schools, they actually interact and help kids instead of sitting in the back on their phone.
                       The potential candidate should possess skills working with a diverse, transient population.

                       Principals to custodial workers and everyone in between. They will inherit unfilled teaching 
                       positions, administrative, and central offices positions and still be held accountable for low test 
                       scores, falling graduation rates and transitioning to full day Pre-K as sanctioned by the state of 
                       Maryland. Finding the College-degreed and CDA CERTIFIED Paraeducators to assist with the 
                       all day Pre-K program and the designated space in the schools to house said programs. The 
                       new superintendent must be a good communicator, genuinely enjoy working with children and 
                       adults. And only have the best interest of our school district at heart. No side jobs, consulting, 
                       or other distractions. Their sole focus is the continued development and improvement of all the

                       Trustworthy
         483           The new superintendent should be laser-focused on accountability. Hold students accountable      3/20/2023 3:44 PM
                       to behavior standards, hold parents accountable to supporting their children, and hold the
                       teachers accountable to providing the children with access to quality instruction.

         485           Characteristics that the new superintendent should possess to be successful here are             3/20/2023 3:38 PM
                       providing leadership, maintenance, and innovative teachings to provide the best possible
                       education for the students.
         486           We need a superintendent who will rotate people in the curriculum offices (math, ELA, music,     3/20/2023 3:38 PM
                       etc.). We need a superintendent who will allow principals autonomy but who will make sure a
                       principal or assistant principal will not single-handedly create a culture of resentment and
                       chaos without being checked on it. I have seen this before and heard from other BCPS
                       teachers where this happens and is happening.
         487           The new superintendent must be willing to wade through the politics and pandering to the         3/20/2023 3:37 PM
                       needs of privileged communities in the county and look to where the need is. They must also
                       have a commitment to put students first, especially students of color. They must also be a
                       creative thinker with a talent for building community partnerships.
         488           The superintendent needs to understand quality instruction and how to deliver quality            3/20/2023 3:36 PM
                       professional learning to a large number of staff. The superintendent needs to know how to
                       motivate leaders within the organization and provide growth opportunities, support, and listen to
                       the input from this group regarding how to move forward with teaching, learning and leading.

                        the positions they are appointed to. Ability to be seen and among staff to be accessible and
                        supportive to staff needs. Needs to have an ability to have appointed staff assigned from prior

                        transparency will be critical.
         492            The superintendent should honor the constitution and separation of church and state. I was        3/20/2023 3:27 PM
                        disturbed that the outgoing superintendent conducted the All County Choir in a Christian song,
                        that was one of 4 Christian songs done by the choir. The music was beautiful, but by only
                        representing one religion, this created the appearance that the county is endorsing a county
                        religion. It was really shocking.
         493            a balanced thinker beholden to no political ideologies. a creative problem solver. A person       3/20/2023 3:25 PM

         494            Have experience as a classroom teacher. Have extensive experience in compliance with              3/20/2023 3:24 PM

                        on buses and in the schools - not just by signing a meaningless document in the online

                        make the schools exceptional. Excellence is not necessarily expensive, but it does require
                        leadership that is both inspired and inspiring. Teachers are facing huge challenges theses days
                        and should be supported to provide the best for our kids.

                        the school system better. This cant be just for politics.
         503            The administration and superintendent needs to listen to all stakeholders and communicate         3/20/2023 3:16 PM
                        appropriately to the community in a diplomatic way. Students should be the absolute priority in
                        decision making. The superintendent should be a great mediator, making fair and just
                        decisions FOR THE STUDENTS, and not be bullied by special interest groups. It would also
                        good if the superintendent was either from the local area or a similar area so we know that he
                        or she has succeeded in the past.
         504            Backbone made of steel, transparency and not just collecting another check.                       3/20/2023 3:15 PM

          507           The superintendent needs to realize that every part of BCPS is so different with different           3/20/2023 3:11 PM
                        needs. Give principals the authority to decide the needs for their schools. Take out CRT from
                        the curriculum. I truly believe that BCPS should be divided into smaller sections so it can be
                        better handled. Look at our school buildings: they are old and falling apart and dirty. We need
                        more middle schools and high schools to accommodate the overbuilding that the county
                        executive is conducting! I would like to see a superintendent that is not in bed with the
                        teachers Union. For example during the pandemic the current superintendent did not open
                        schools earlier because of a deal he had with the union. Well leave politics out of it all! This is
                        supposed to be a non partisan job so stop the politics and truly be in this for the kids. Let the
                        new superintendent know that we as parents want a successful school system we are tried of
                        the last 3 superintendents and all of their dirty deals. Please be honest, forthcoming and in the
                        best interest of the kids. There are gifted and bright kids in our school system but because if

                        policies.
          528           Should be a good communicator, able to explain decisions to staff, students, and community.          3/20/2023 2:59 PM
          529           Good communicator, strong leader, collaborator, visionary appropriately reflective of the            3/20/2023 2:58 PM
                        student population and parents.
          530           An understanding of the new generation of learners. A flexibility to recognize that students         3/20/2023 2:58 PM
                        have different learning needs. The one-size fits all model no longer works. A faith in the next
                        generation with some optimism.

          532           New superintendent needs to focus on what to do with disruptive students having them coming          3/20/2023 2:57 PM
                        back to class the next day is not going to work. We had a student hit a teacher and was back
                        the next day. Also focus on learning too many kids are falling behind.
          533           Ability to engage community, build trust. Understanding of district financial operations- where      3/20/2023 2:57 PM
                        dollars are coming from and where they’re going- and being able to clearly communicate that to
                        parents and media.
          534           The desire to bring Baltimore County back to where is once was. The quality has gone                 3/20/2023 2:56 PM
                        tremendously over the years. The next superintendent will need to come with a calculator, they
                        will need to figure out how to make the budget work so that these short handed teachers can
                        get the support they need with additional staff. They also need to be compensated for what
                        they are dealing with. Until you increase the incentive this is just a broken record.
          535           Good communicator with a willingness to be transparent. Understands how discipline, or the           3/20/2023 2:55 PM
                        lack thereof, impacts student achievement for all. Willing to create a real culture of excellence,
                        not just pay lip service to the concept. Understands that lowering the bar of expectations will
                        only result in lower results overall. Must also understand that accountability in education
                        should extend to more than just to teachers and staff - it must also hold students and parents
                        accountable, even when (especially when) that is difficult.
          536           Vested interest in the community would be good. We've hired from out of state before and that        3/20/2023 2:55 PM
                        didn't go well. A home grown candidate would be great and probably have the respect of the
                        school admin and teachers. Another job hopper from out of state would not look good. I think
                        morale is hit when outside people bring in all their own people without regard for great internal
                        candidates.
          537           patience, understanding, diverse in all areas of education, able to communicate to adults and        3/20/2023 2:54 PM
                        children
          538           Substantial experience in the classroom is crucial. When we have people who haven't taught           3/20/2023 2:53 PM
                        for years, or who never really taught, they do not see the value in the teachers' input. We need
                        someone who has done what we do, so they understand what we are saying. The new
                        candidate should be communicative towards all stakeholders. Previously, especially during the
                        pandemic, teachers were literally the last people to know major decisions. They need to be a
                        good listener. It seems like a juvenile statement, but so far our superintendents have not done
                        a great job listening to the people who work for them.
          539           Trustworthy, Good Communication Skills, Transparency, Critical Thinking. Stop taking the             3/20/2023 2:53 PM
                        easy way out of events.

          541           BCPS needs a superintendent who has historical knowledge and commitment to our county.               3/20/2023 2:52 PM
                        We need someone who knows what has and has not worked in the past. We need someone
                        who has excellent communication skills and will form relationships with principals and
                        stakeholders. We need someone who will be accountable for the data and work earnestly to
                        make improvements. We need a servant leader.
