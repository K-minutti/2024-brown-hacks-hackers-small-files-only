                Current CCSD anti bullying policies are not effective in addressing hate-related offenses or 
                systemic racism within the district. The Nevada Alliance for Student Diversity urges the CCSD 
                board of trustees to collaborate with families, community leaders, and racial justice advocates 
                to develop an anti-racism policy. This policy is long overdue, and the community demands 
                action. No more delays! #WriteThePolicy Nevada Alliance for Student Diversity

                It has come to my attention that an Anti-Racism Policy will be implemented in the Clark County 
                School District. The District has called upon the community to give input as to what we think 
                should be included within this policy. It is my opinion that the cause of each individual student9s 
                lack of success must be determined prior to developing any policy. An anti-racist policy should 
                have the goal of decreasing disparities and improving outcomes for all students to be 
                successful: 1. Please do not lower or get rid of objective standards in the name of achieving 
                equality of outcome. Focus on having high expectations so that we don9t plant the seeds of the 
                idea of white superiority and black/brown inferiority. 2. Provide supports to address unique 
                needs of individual children such as smaller class sizes, smaller schools, tutoring, resource 
                rooms with resource teachers, counseling and family therapy services, substance abuse classes, 
                12-step program, and whatever else is required based on the needs of the struggling student. 3. 
                Use the same disciplinary action standards as the private schools in the area. Do not tolerate 
                drug use, bullying, fighting, low grades etc. When it happens provide discipline, determine 
                cause and refer for appropriate resources area. 4. School choice truly would be beneficial for 
                students that attend schools that consistently underperform. Provide counseling services for 
                families to understand their options. 5. Teacher training to identify struggling students and to 
                refer to appropriate resources. Provide teachers with appropriate supports so they can be 
                successful and in turn do their best job possible. Students do their best when held to high 
                expectations and have the appropriate supports in place. If we can address students on an 
                individual basis versus as a group, based on race, it seems that we will address the issues and 
                have better outcomes.

                March9s meetings were so much better. The instant feedback is what so many want. The anti-
                racism policy doesn9t seem to be the topic for this style of meetings. Make the virtual ones 
                more like March9s pretty please! We have some questions we9d like input back on. Last night 
                was a brutal beat down and by far not an engagement. Just a vent session. We can get that at a 
                board meeting. I will reiterate that we very much appreciate these meetings and hope they 
                continue into the future. We want the meeting on the 1.1B! Anna Marie Binder 702-906-6517

                My name is Clifton Berry. I have 4 children. 3 boys and 1 girl. The boys are currently attending 
                schools in the Clark County system and she will be too, soon. Father being first, understanding 
                the word prejudice combats racism. The time is now to cleanse our Education institutions, to 
                systematically re-lay foundations to the roots of what is morally correct and equal. Within the 
                last 5 years I've been membered through a School Organization Team to an Superintendent 
                Advisory committee, while also contributing to grassroots coalitions and multiple media 
                platforms. Prevention of racism can rather than should be reinstituted in policies and laws 
                through our governmental means. Locally to globality, the Educators position must be 
                respected as taught through the learning of vocabulary words. Being morally correct and the 
                accepting of passing honors on-is commonly taught in good parental training, which presents 
                often includes a stable household. Teachings in prevention and awareness of racism can be 
                instructed in Our system of life learnings, but at what age does it begin? At the youngest age, 
                when a child looks and shows emotions of enjoying life; in viewing, reading or speaking words, 
                expressing our appreciation and not judging on a color of skin. Be a good gestured person living 
                to raise children to be better than us. All must come together and be better individuals to 
                surpass racism. Racism is alive because of prejudice. Let's prevent and provide awareness in 
                prejudice, hold accountability in prejudices before it reaches racism. Prevent prejudices in life 
                to combat racism. Policy's need to be reinstituted, loopholes have been used far too often 
                allow the racism. Understanding our leadership could utilize more direction and shared visions. 
                Come together as our people in whole life. Share the respect of living to appreciate one and the 
                other. Give a helping hand when possible and use your eyes, voice, thoughts and gestures in a 
                meaningful way. Thank you for the time and platform allowing me to share an understanding in 
                my vision, yet seeking a position in direction. I would enjoy working and being a part of making 
                a change/difference in suppressing racism in our community. @USSecEdMCardona

                I have spoken to 2 people that were at the meeting tonight that wanted to speak but did not 
                after watching this group ridicule a speaker. It is truly clear after watching all 3 of these 
                meetings that the interest is not in inclusion, diversity, or debate. All opinions matter as all kids 
                are impacted by decisions that will be made. No one child is more important than another 
                based on their skin color. I grew up fighting for equality and colorblindness; I believe it and 
                taught it to my children. What I saw tonight is just how far backwards and separated we have 
                become. The term "anti-racism" is the equivalent of critical race theory which simply teaches 
                racism and children to be ashamed of their skin color. No one is going to teach my 
                grandchildren that they are racist or should feel guilty for something they do not believe or had 
                any part of simply based on their skin color. That is not empowering children. It is abundantly 
                clear after these meetings that input from all sides is not welcome or received. I9ve received 
                several comments saying I need to <educate= myself; there is no interest in educating anyone 
                including our children. The only acceptable option is to agree. That is not open discussion, it9s 
                bullying which does not change minds it simply shuts down any debate. THIS is how people 
                were treated "respectfully" tonight. It is no wonder more people are not speaking up; if CCSD 
                continues to allow this one sided conversation, it will not benefit anyone.

                Please see attached letter relating to the Anti-racism Community Input Meeting for your 
                reference. I spoke in-person on 4/14/2021, and was very disappointed how the audience was 
                so disrespectful to someone who had a difference in opinion. I will not let my experience today 
                deter me from speaking from my heart for what I believe is right. Again, thank you for the

                Good evening and thank you for this opportunity,  
                Today, I would like to start off by telling you a little about myself and my family. My name is 
                Ashley, I was born and raised here in LV, and I am a stay-at-home mom of two children, ages 4 
                and 6, that attend school in CCSD. One of my greatest fear is public speaking; however, I 
                attended the in-person meeting yesterday and felt inspired to tell my story along with the 
                others.   
                I am a White Italian American and I am not a racist. My family9s diverse ethnic categories 
                include all walks of life; European, Middle Eastern, Latin, and African American to name a few. I 
                still remember the tears of joy streaming down my face the day my Uncle Armando was 
                nationalized here in LV.   
                I am a firm believer that tough conversations and educating our youth, in any subject matter, 
                starts at home. I raise my children with a couple mottos in mind; Be nice be kind, mind your 
                manners, life can be hard at times but always beautiful, and 8Same, Same but Different9 - a 
                wonderful book provided by CCSD.  
                I will not allow my children, at any point in their lives, feel that they are oppressors just because 
                they were born white. It saddens me that the actions of the few represent the bunch. I truly 
                believe anti racist policies will further divide us as a people because it is dealing with a topic and 
                not the issue. If you must implement a policy for CCSD staff and administration do so, but don9t 
                put this on our kids; they do not see color.   
                I will leave you with a quote:  
                <Within each of us there is an intense need to feel that we belong. This feeling of unity 
                and togetherness comes through the warmth of a smile, a handshake, or a hug, through 
                laughter and unspoken demonstrations of love. It come in the quiet, reverent moments of 
                soft conversation and in listening.= – William R. Bradford

                Hello, my name is Sarah Comroe for the record.  
                 
                I am here as a teacher, as a parent, and as a community member.  
                 
                                                          Reference 3.03 (B)                              Page 4 of 13
                I am here to say that we do indeed need an anti-racism and anti-bias policy. But this is already 
                clear. With 6 of the 7 trustees agreeing that we need a policy, I feel that we are heading this 
                correct direction.  
                 
                I really came here today to say some of the things that I think should be a part of this policy.  
                 
                I think this policy should be created by the community, specifically by the marginalized groups 
                that have been impacted to the point of needing this policy. I am talking about community 
                members, and not your "regulars= that are already connected to the district through various 
                committees, programs, and groups. I am talking about every day, average community 
                members. Parents, teachers, extra-curricular program leaders, coaches, and most importantly 
                STUDENTS. There should be members of this group from a diverse spectrum of peoples that can 
                speak from a place of experiencing bias. This should include members of different BIPOC 
                cultures, Neurodiversities and differently abled, and members of the LGBTQIA+ community.  
                 
                I think this policy should include things like consequences for racist and bias actions, training for 
                staff, and a segment on creating diverse curriculum. The consequences should always include 
                education for those involved in a situation that requires the use of this policy. The training 
                should not be cookie cutter trainings where we click through a video just to check a box. They 
                should be in person, participation required. It is pounded into educators DO NOT JUST TALK AT 
                YOUR STUDENTS. ENGAGE THEM. Yet all of our trainings are just direct instruction. It makes no 
                sense. This needs to be different. Within this training, we should be taught how to create 
                diverse and engaging curriculum, and teach from a variety of perspectives, not just 
                Neurotypical, Cis-Het, White, Male perspective.  
                 
                Yesterday, a young man, a teacher, said that he was not allowed to teach about white privilege 
                in his class, the admin told him it was too sensitive a subject. My 11th and 12th grade students 
                are begging to talk about this. They want to engage in conversation with their peers about the 
                huge difference between the BLM protests at the capital, and the insurrection at the capital. 
                My Deaf students are trying to process what happened to Dre Hollingsworth, a Deaf Black 
                mother in North Las Vegas that was handcuffed, her 11 year old daughter forced to interpret 
                for her just last week. We should be taught ways to work through situations that are happening 
                in this country (and in our own backyard) right now with our students, that are culturally 
                sensitive and supportive of our BIPOC, LGBTQIA+, Differently Abled, and Neurodiverse 
                students.  
                Many parents that are against this policy are saying "send them back full time! They NEED to be 
                in school! It is such a huge part of their lives, and shapes them to be the future!" and in the 
                same breath are shouting that these topics are not the business of schools to teach. If schools 
                and education are such a huge part of what shapes our children (and it is), how are we shaping 
                them if we are not making sure that they have a robust and full understanding of the 
                community they live in and appropriate ways to interact with people that might be different 
                from them?

                This policy needs to be upheld, from our students, to our site based staff, to our central offices, 
                to our transportation staff, to our trustees. I have so much more to say about this policy, but I 
                am sure I am nearly out of time. So I will leave with this, don't just WRITE THE POLICY, have our 
                community come together to write the policy.

                Anti-racism is always a good thing, how it is implemented, however, may not be. Over the past 
                year, children in CCSD did not have the same opportunity as children in other states or even 
                children attending charter or private schools within our own state. To me, this is an example of 
                systematic racism. This could be mitigated by allowing families to have control over funds to 
                use at the public, chartered, or private school of their choice. While I am in favor of creating 
                equal opportunity for all students and a comfortable place to learn, I do not support social 
                projects similar to and including Critical Race Theory. My 10 year old son plays on a soccer 
                team and has developed a friendship with a teammate whos skin tone could not be more 
                different from his own. If we implement ideas of white supremacy or anything other than 
                merit based achievement into our schools, it would only result in creating a racial divide and 
                prevent these natural friendships from forming. There are people of every race that struggle 
                and we should be helping those that need it. Assuming a hardship based on race not only 
                reinforces a negative stereotype, but also doesn't solve the problem as we would just be 
                substituting students from one race needing assistance and not getting it to another race with 
                the same problem. In summary, I am for helping all students (of all colors), that have similar 
                hardships or life challenges. Curriculum or policies based on a persons race, I m against. i think 
                a commonality that we all have is that racism should not be tolerated in our schools; the 
                divided only comes in with concerns over the controversial Critical Race Theory or any other 
                race dividing program disguised as an anti-racism program. Thanks! Megan

                Thank you for having an open forum for input into the district9s Racism Policy. I attended T 
                night9s meeting at LVA but (besides being totally nervous) did not want to interrupt the 
                personal testimonies being shared. I do not have a personal testimony beyond being 
                concerned with some Critical Race Theory influence being felt in my daughter9s history class at 
                Arbor View. My daughter is going to talk to her teacher first, and if there is no evidence given

                for what has been said (<this woman in this interview is probably racist, and probably doesn9t 
                know it=, <systematic racism persisted past the economic boom of the late 1990s, preventing 
                black people from gaining wealth=, <schools are more racially segregated now than they were 
                in the 1970s=, <gun ownership and domestic terrorism are often connected with Christianity 
                and white supremacy=), then we will take the matter to Principal McPartlin. I was concerned 
                about the title of the community meeting, <Anti-Racism=, because as the man in the brown 
                sport jacket said, that is a term related closely to Critical Race Theory. To be <anti-racist=, in 
                CRT terms, goes beyond being against racism. It involves forcing students to proclaim, if you 
                are white, that you are always an oppressor of all other races, even if you do not mean to be. 
                About two months ago there was legal action taken against a LV private school because a 
                student got a failing grade in his Sociology class because he would not proclaim this. So last 
                month I emailed Principal McPartlin and asked what AVHS9s stance was on Critical Race Theory 
                and systematic racism being taught in AVHS9s classrooms, and he said that AVHS was the pilot 
                program for CRT. Concerned, I called the district and was able to speak with Brandon Muller, 
                who said that Principal McPartlin probably did not understand what I was asking, that CRT was 
                just a theory, and that there were no plans to implement it into the district9s curriculum. Did 
                you name the community meeting <Anti-Racism= to promote CRT, or do you just mean 
                <Policies Addressing Racism=? CRT says that all white people are taught to be racist from birth, 
                which is, in itself, racist. I hope that this is not the direction that CCSD is going. I certainly did 
                not hear anything at the meeting that led me to this conclusion. What I heard was parents 
                wanting policies put in place to define racism and reactions to it, so that teachers and students 
                know where they stand. Teachers educated, students protected. That sounds good to me. I 
                would urge you, as you put together your policies, to avoid any language that lumps all 
                students of one skin tone together. All whites are not alike (some are racist, some are not), 
                and all people of color are not alike. I encourage you to make policy that looks at each case 
                individually to see if racism was a component or not. And to define racism clearly so that 
                everyone knows what the <rules= are. When we moved from CA to Vegas, almost everyone 
                told us not to do it because the school system was terrible. Our 3 kids have gone to 
                Scherkenbach, Cadwallader, LVA, and now AVHS. We have been pleased with the education 
                and the district9s kind response to COVID, especially Principal McPartlin9s leadership. I hope 
                that our freshman at AVHS can continue on and graduate from there. But we will pull our kids 
                out if more statements are made, without evidence, like those I shared at the beginning of this 
                email. Thank you, Tricia Coblentz

                Anti-racism program (unless EVERY single race is included and protected) is racist itself and has 
                no place in America and it's school system. To prioritize one race and to exclude/leave any

                children should be also taught independent free thinking. They should learn about American 
                Exceptionalism and dangerous consequences of propaganda. If implemented anti-racist 
                program will drive large numbers of parents to withdraw their students from CCSD. Sincerely,

                Parent - Requested name and personal information be omitted from the comment 
                 
                CCSD needs to be absolutely clear with the community regarding what is and is not being 
                considered in an anti-racism policy. --I'm seeing too many social media comments veering off 
                into speculation. Communicate the intention. 
                 
                I intended to share this during 3/13's meeting, but anxiety had the best of me. 
                 
                I've been out of K-12 education for almost 20 years now and racially motivated and targeted 
                hate have plauged our public education system for far too long. We are past due in 
                implementing a policy which properly protects our students and staff. 
                 
                • A kindergarter cried while begging her mom for sunglasses after classmates spent their recess 
                taunting her with their fingers to the sides of their face to lift and stretch the corners of their 
                eyes. 
                • A 1st grade student told a group of kids at a birthday party not to be friends with "the Chinese 
                girl" because she'd eat their dogs if they were. --The "Chinese" girl's mom had her leave early 
                when the racial taunts ensued. 
                 
                • A 3rd grade teacher had an obvious dislike for a well-performing, well-behaved student and 
                too often lined her class up by playing a game of <differences= and <similarities=.  Without fault, 
                the only student with black hair was always called last. --one time it was, "If you have slanted 
                eyes" (when all but 1 student was in line). 
                 
                • A middle school teacher refused to assist a struggling student with a math problem telling her 
                "It's in your DNA, you shouldn't need help". 
                 
                                                          Reference 3.03 (B)                              Page 8 of 13
                • A high-school history teacher openly used the word "Jap" while claiming Japanese-Americans 
                willingly relocated into incarceration camps for *their* protection during WWII. 
                 
                • A high school student with a confederate flag on the roof of his truck always felt the need to 
                jump in front of a specific student in the hallways to yell <Booom!!! Hiroshima!!= directly in her 
                face. 
                 
                • Another high school student would always <dance= in front a specific student while pointing 
                to his face claiming he had no eyebrows in a mockingly Asian accent. —the first time, he 
                explained it was a <joke= about nuclear fall-out from Hiroshima. 
                 
                • A truck with a confederate flag slowed to call a student <Chun-Li= as a cup filled with liquid 
                was hurled at her... he drove past at first, but made a u-turn to do so... 
                 
                • A high school girl was sexually assaulted by 2 classmates because evidently some believe the 
                shape of someone's eyes indicates their anatomy is different... —One said, <I want to see if 
                your pussy is sideways.= The other claimed, <I never had a Chinese.=... 
                 
                ...Please know these incidents are NOT from within CCSD. Rather, a small selection of personal 
                testimony to attest that racially motivated incidents are traumatic and linger for lifetime. 
                 
                We all know some "jokes" and targeted hate motivated bullying can escalate into violence, and 
                I only wish an organization like No Racism in Schools #1865 was around in my small rural 
                hometown of the inland northwest during the time I went to school. 
                 
                Freedom to hate and be racist is one thing, but there should never be freedom from 
                consequences within our education system. 
                 
                Staff members need to know how to handle incidents and report them with clarity and we need 
                data to identify any pattern of behavior perpetrated by staff members.  Thank you

                Good Afternoon, I went to both in person meetings with my sister Ashley Tewey. On the 
                second day my sister spoke and gave her option on this matter. Unfortunately, I was extremely 
                disappointed in the way my sister was treated by the crowd. I was expecting someone on the 
                panel to ask the audience to give her some respect and let her speak, but that did not happen. 
                My sister left that meeting in tears. I guess if you have a different option then it justifies a 
                complete lack of respect, very sad.

                "We need an anti-racism policy to clearly define what racism is, what anti-blackness is, what

                implicit bias within our classrooms." 
                "Anti-racism is as basic to humanity, an anti-racism policy would proactively limit CCSD of 
                liability by holding all stakeholders accountable" "Black educators here in CCSD are also in 
                need of an anti-racism policy, in communications, in leadership and administration, in 
                curriculum and instruction, in training and professional development, in hiring practices and in
