           Schools does not teach, nor do we promote, the philosophy of Critical Race Theory in any of our 
           schools. Stafford County Public Schools’ K-12 history and social sciences program is based on the 
           Virginia Standards of Learning and the accompanying history and social sciences curriculum 
           framework. For the public, in order to assist you in an examination of the teaching materials 
           employed in SCPS, as well as across the Commonwealth of Virginia, I encourage you to visit our SCPS 
           history and social studies instruction webpage. This webpage will provide you with the standards of 
           learning, curriculum framework, and additional resources for instruction.= Dr. Jones then shared an 
           informational handout from the VSBA entitled Understanding the Difference Between Critical Race 
           Theory and Education Equity: What You Need to Know. 
           Dr. Jones also thanked retiring Superintendent Dr. Scott Kizner, who is now the longest-serving 
           superintendent in Virginia. Dr. Jones spoke of his admiration and affection for Dr. Kizner and wished 
           him well in his future. On behalf of herself and the other members of the Board, Ms. Hazard also 
           thanked Dr. Kizner and expressed their well-wishes for him and his family.

           Dr. Warner volunteered to continue serving as the Board’s liaison to the Council. 
           Ms. Randall moved, and Dr. Chase seconded, that the Board appoint Dr. Warner as its liaison to 
           the Head Start Policy Council for the term of September 2021 through August 2022. The motion 
           passed unanimously. 
        10.02  Cancel or Repurpose the September 21, 2021 Special Called Board Meeting 
           In light of the Virginia Governor’s recent mask mandate for all pre-K through 12 schools, the Board’s 
           special called meeting of September 21 is no longer required for the previously-planned discussion 
           regarding the SCPS mask policy. The Board will instead use that opportunity to meet with the 
           consultants from BWP & Associates to discuss the superintendent search. 
           Dr. Warner moved, and Ms. Randall seconded, that the Board repurpose the September 21 special 
           called meeting to meet with consultants from BWP & Associates to discuss the superintendent 
           search. The motion passed by a vote of six ayes and one nay (Yeung). 
        10.03  Award of Two Contracts to Allied Instructional Services, L.L.C., in the Amount of $101,250 Each,

           Mr. Byrnett confirmed that these two positions were referenced in his recruiting and retention 
           update to the Board earlier in this meeting. 
           Dr. Chase moved, and Dr. Warner seconded, that the Board move this matter from Information 
           (as Item 11.01) to Action (as Item 10.03) as requested by staff. The motion passed unanimously. 
           Ms. Healy moved, and Dr. Warner seconded, that the Board award two contracts to Allied 
           Instructional Services as recommended by staff. The motion passed unanimously. 
        10.04  Adoption of a Resolution Authorizing an Application to the Virginia Public School Authority 
           (VPSA) for the Sale of Bonds in an Amount Not to Exceed $12,480,000, With the Objective of 
           Providing Net Proceeds of $11,610,000 for the 2021 Fall Bond Pool 
           Ms. Hazard questioned whether the three projects proposed for these new bond funds are our 
           most urgent needs. She stated that Hartwood Elementary School has many very pressing issues that 
           must be addressed. 
           Ms. Hollerback stated that the chillers at Brooke Point High School (BPHS) desperately need to be 
           fixed or replaced. Executive Director of Facilities and Operations John Anderson reported that the 
           chillers at BPHS are already being addressed. That work is already funded, and is scheduled to be 
           completed next year. 
           Assistant Superintendent of Finance and Administration Chris Fulmer explained that the three 
           projects proposed for these funds are ones which were approved in last year’s CIP list for this bond 
           sale. The projects are: repair of mechanical systems and finishes at North Stafford High School 
           ($3,654,000); upgrade of mechanical, roof, and finishes at Ferry Farm Elementary School 
           ($2,500,000); and partial funding for the construction of High School #6 ($5,456,000). He stated that 
           we have many, many needs (as shown in the proposed FY23 CIP and <3R= plan at Agenda Item 
           11.07, below). He explained that the three projects being recommended for the fall bond sale are 
           those which we are poised to start right away.

           funds. The motion passed by a vote of four ayes (Chase, Randall, Warner, Yeung) and two nays 
           (Hazard, Healy). Ms. Hollerback was not present during the vote.

           Regarding the mobile application software for parents to track their child’s bus, Dr. Chase suggested 
           that we offer user training to parents who are new to the system. 
        11.04  Award of a Contract to Miller’s Supplies at Work for Air-Max Air Purifier Filters in the Amount of 
           $339,838.16 (Using Federal Grant Funds)

           notify us when it is time to change the filter. 
        11.05  Award of a Professional Contract in the Amount of $7,922,385 to Grimm & Parker Architects for 
           Design and Construction Administration Services for the High School #6 Project (Using VPSA Bond 
           Funds)  
           Mr. Anderson reported that our staff is working on the educational specifications for the new 
           school. Once finalized, the specifications will be sent to the architects. He stated that there are 
           ongoing discussions and meetings about the specifications and the design for the school. A steering 
           committee and focus groups have been involved in the process. Information about the steering 
           committee and focus groups was shared with the Board on January 26 and June 8. 
           Mr. Fulmer stated that some of the funding for this contract will be coming from future bond sales. 
           The contract will be stretched across the four-year life of the project and will be paid out in 
           increments during that time.

        11.06  Adoption of a Resolution Authorizing an Application to the VPSA for the Sale of Bonds in an 
           Amount Not to Exceed $12,480,000, With the Objective of Providing Net Proceeds of $11,610,000 
           for the 2021 Fall Bond Pool 
           This item was moved to Action. (See Item 10.04.) 
        11.07  Approval of the Proposed FY23-FY32 Stafford County Public Schools Capital Improvement 
           Program and 3R Infrastructure 
           Supervisor of Planning and GIS Lionel White briefed the Board on the proposed FY23-FY32 CIP and 
           <3R= Infrastructure Plan. He advised the Board that the previous <flat dollar= revenue approach to 
           the Schools’ 3R projects has not allowed the school division to keep pace with known deficiencies. A 
           new funding approach based on a percentage of tax revenue or school capital/construction budget 
           should be considered. 
           Ms. Hazard and Ms. Healy requested that staff look for ways to include a capacity increase as part 
           of the fine arts wing renovation at North Stafford High School. If staff are unable to make this 
           change in the FY23 CIP, they will do it in the FY24 version. 
           Ms. Healy suggested that the Board chair talk with her counterpart on the board of supervisors to 
           plan a joint work session between the two boards to discuss a new and better funding strategy for 
           our 3R projects. 
           Dr. Chase asked if any of the air quality projects on the 3R list will qualify for federal pandemic 
           stimulus funds. Mr. Fulmer responded that the State will actually be allocating a considerable 
           amount of special funding for air quality improvement in schools. Staff is currently waiting for more 
           information. The funds may require a local match. 
           Ms. Hazard spoke about the urgent need to replace the shingle roof at Hartwood Elementary 
           School. Mr. Anderson stated that staff is targeting the use of FY22 year-end funds to replace the 
           roof during the summer of 2022.
