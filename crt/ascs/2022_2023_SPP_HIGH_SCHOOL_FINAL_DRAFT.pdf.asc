              INTRODUCTION  
               
              To ensure that Charlotte County Public Schools is meeting the needs of all students and is compliant to 
              legislation, the Charlotte County School Board has established a comprehensive program for high school 
              student progression which includes, but is not limited to, the following:  
                  •    standards for evaluating each student9s performance, including how well he or she masters the 
                       performance standards approved by the State Board of Education,  
                  •    specific levels of performance in English Language Arts, Science, Mathematics, and Social Studies 
                       for each grade level, including the levels of performance on statewide assessments, 
                  •    options for Academically Challenging Curriculum to Enhance Learning (ACCEL), 
                  •    clear definitions of earning high school credit aligned with sound grading and reporting 
                       procedures, 
                  •    pathways to graduation and diploma options. 
                
              The Charlotte County Public Schools9 High School Student Progression Plan is a document delineating 
              what a student must know and be able to do to graduate and what the district will do to help the student 
              meet the requirements for graduation. The plan and the procedures for its implementation reflect clearly 
              that promotion is based on student mastery of grade level/course standards. School attendance 
              procedures as described in the district9s Code of Student Conduct are considered as part of the Student 
              Progression Plan.  
               
              All incoming ninth grade students and their parents or guardians shall be active participants in 
              choosing an end-of-high school destination and putting in place preliminary four-year plans to achieve 
              those goals.  It is our belief that students perform better when they are interested in what they are 
              taught; therefore, all students will enter high school identifying career pathways based on self-identified 
              personal interests and abilities that may lead to future careers.  These pathways are flexible and open to 
              change during registration.  These destinations will also accommodate the needs of Exceptional Student 
              Education (ESE) students as defined in the Individual Education Plans (IEP) and students with active 
              504 Plans. 
                                                                                                                                                
              STUDENT PROGRESSION PLAN – HIGH SCHOOL 2022-2023                                                THE DIVISION OF LEARNING  8 
               
             Destinations include the following: 
                  •   Four-year university, community college plus university, or military academy; 
                  •   Two-year postsecondary degree; 
                  •   Postsecondary vocational-technical certificate; and 
                  •   Immediate employment or entry3level military. 
             Credits will be earned based on student achievement of the performance standards outlined for each 
             course.  The grades on report cards will reflect the level of achievement of these standards.  Students who 
             do not achieve these standards will be provided extended learning opportunities and the necessary 
             support to be successful. 
              
             All procedures listed in the High School Student Progression Plan are subject to change due to School 
             Board or legislative action and are updated yearly and posted on the district website.

             The School Board believes that daily school attendance is essential to the educational success of each 
             student (School Board Policy 5200). Students are expected to be in school and in class on time in order to 
             receive full benefit from the instructional programs of the Charlotte County Public Schools. All absences 
             must be reported and explained by a parent or guardian within two (2) school days after the student9s 
             return to school.  Research has shown that 10% or more of instructional time missed by students is an 
             early warning indicator for possible academic struggles; this measure is used to define chronic 
             absenteeism nationwide. 
              
             School attendance is required of all students who have attained the age of 6 years or who will have 
                                                          st
             attained the age of 6 years by February 1  of any school year, but who have not attained the age of 16, 
             unless otherwise exempt by law. Students 16 and 17 years of age are required to attend unless an exit 
             interview process has been completed by both parents and students. 
             At the high school level, students with excused absences will be permitted and encouraged to make up 
             work, tests, and quizzes and will not receive an academic penalty unless the work is not made-up within 
             the allowable time frame. 
                 1.  If a pattern of non-attendance develops, the principal or designee may require documentation to 
                     excuse an absence. 
                 2.  In the case of unexcused absences, a teacher may deduct up to 30% from the earned grade for work 
                     made up.  
             For specific information about attendance including the types of absences as well as guidelines and 
             responsibilities for make-up work, please refer to the Code of Student Conduct on the district website.

             CURRICULUM AND INSTRUCTION [F.S. 1003.4156] 
             Charlotte County Public Schools provides all courses required for high school graduation and provides 
             appropriate instruction designed to ensure that students meet State Board of Education adopted 
             standards.  There shall be instruction in every subject matter, field, topic or specific area required by law 
             in accordance with the Florida Statutes and the Florida Department of Education.  High school courses 
             may be offered to middle school students who meet the appropriate entrance requirements.   
              
             Mastery of Student Performance Standards 
             The curriculum of all high school courses is based upon the appropriate State Board approved State 
             Board  of  Education  standards.  Course  performance  standards  will  be  clearly  communicated to all 
             students at the beginning of a course or unit of instruction. A variety of instructional strategies and 
             instructional/technological media will be used to ensure equal opportunity to learn and meet the needs of 
             individuals or student groups. Assessment  of student  achievement  of  the  performance  standards  will 
             be  done  on  a regular,  continuous basis using a variety of assessment methods, teacher observations, 
             classroom assignments,  performance tasks, portfolios, and other relevant documentation.  Mastery of 
             performance standards is required for course credit. 
              
             Considerations When Creating a Four-Year Plan 
             Creating a learning path within a four-year plan is unique to each student and is based on his/her 
             academic needs and college or career interests.  Students and their parents/guardians are encouraged to 
             meet with their Certified School Counselor on a regular basis to explore options, confirm a pathway, and 
             make decisions based upon academic needs throughout their high school career.  The following 
             considerations should be kept in mind: 
                  •   Computer literacy is an expectation in all high school courses. 
                  •   Students wishing to attend selective universities are advised to take Advanced Placement 
                      course(s) and explore AICE coursework, whenever available, during their high school 
                      careers. 
                  •   Students should consider taking as many dual enrollment courses as possible to maximize 
                      college courses without having the burden of payment.  Please note that some colleges outside 
                      the state of Florida do not recognize dual credit courses. 
                  •   Students who take dual enrollment courses are creating an official college transcript. 
                  •   Students should take electives which are academic in nature or which follow the intended 
                      career pathway. 
                  •   Highly selective colleges prefer four years of the same foreign language. 
              
             Students are encouraged to participate in leadership roles, community service and in-depth extracurricular 
             activities. 
              
             Course Placement 
             Students will be placed into high school courses based on mastery of the appropriate standards.  
             Consistent with school board rules and in accordance with F.S. 1012.28 (5), the principal of the school is 
             the final authority in the placement of students in programs or classes.

           Course Prerequisites 
           Many courses listed in the Charlotte County Public Schools9 High School Course Catalogs have 
           prerequisites. These prerequisites must be honored unless student petition and the ensuing conversation 
           with a Certified School Counselor indicate that an exception needs to be made based on data and the 
           student9s learning path.  
            
           For more information regarding course prerequisites, please refer to the individual high school’s Course Catalog 
           and/or Curriculum Guide. 
            
           Enrollment in Sequential Courses 
           Subject-area courses that depend on sequential information are expected to be taken in sequential order. 
           In such courses, a student who fails to pass may not be allowed to enroll in the next higher course level 
           until the failed course has been remediated successfully or by retaking the course in a traditional or 
           virtual/online capacity.  If a situation exists which prevents a student from taking a course in sequence, 
           the principal, or designee, may grant an exception. 
            
           Enrollment in Off-Campus Courses 
           Students are expected to take courses offered on their school campus.  However, many opportunities for 
           dual enrollment via articulation agreements with colleges, universities, the Charlotte Technical College, 
           virtual schools, etc. exist and may be considered.  If a student indicates the need to take a course at 
           another location, the student must request permission from the Certified School Counselor citing the need 
           for the course to be taken in an alternate setting. The Certified School Counselor shall grant or deny 
           permission for the student to leave campus. 
            
           Required Instruction [F.S. 1003.42; SBE Rule 6A-1.094124] 
           Members of the instructional staff at all schools, subject to the rules of the State Board of Education and 
           the district school board, shall teach efficiently and faithfully, using the books and materials required that 
           meet the highest standards for professionalism and historical accuracy. Rule 6A-1.094124, Required 
           Instruction Planning and Reporting states the following: <Efficient and faithful teaching of the required 
           topics must be consistent with the State Academic Standards and the Benchmarks for Excellent Student 
           Thinking (B.E.S.T.) Standards. Instruction on the required topics must be factual and objective, and may 
           not suppress or distort significant historical events, such as the Holocaust, slavery, the Civil War and 
           Reconstruction, the civil rights movement and the contributions of women, African American and 
           Hispanic people to our country, as already provided in Section 1003.42(2), F.S. Examples of theories that 
           distort historical events and are inconsistent with State Board approved standards include the denial or 
           minimization of the Holocaust, and the teaching of Critical Race Theory, meaning the theory that racism is 
           not merely the product of prejudice, but that racism is embedded in American society and its legal 
           systems in order to uphold the supremacy of white persons. Instruction may not utilize material from the 
           1619 Project and may not define American history as something other than the creation of a new nation 
           based largely on universal principles stated in the Declaration of Independence. Instruction must include 
           the U.S. Constitution, the Bill of Rights and subsequent amendments. Efficient and faithful teaching 
           further means that any discussion is appropriate for the age and maturity level of the students, and 
           teachers serve as facilitators for student discussion and do not share their personal views or attempt to 
           indoctrinate or persuade students to a particular point of view that is inconsistent with the State Academic 
           Standards and the Benchmarks for Excellent Student Thinking (B.E.S.T.) Standards.

                               United States and amendments thereto, with emphasis on each of the 10 amendments that 
                               make up the Bill of Rights and how the constitution provides the structure of our government. 
                          c.   The arguments in support of adopting our republican form of government, as they are 
                               embodied in the most important of the Federalist Papers. 
                          d.  Flag education, including proper flag display and flag salute. 
                          e.  The elements of civil government, including the primary functions of and interrelationships 
                               between the Federal Government, the state, and its counties, municipalities, school districts,

                               world wars, and the civil rights movement to the present. American history shall be viewed as 
                               factual, not as constructed, shall be viewed as knowable, teachable, and testable, and shall be 
                               defined as the creation of a new nation based largely on the universal principles stated in the 
                               Declaration of Independence. 
                          g.  The history of the Holocaust (1933-1945), the systematic, planned annihilation of European 
                               Jews and other groups by Nazi Germany, a watershed event in the history of humanity, to be 
                               taught in a manner that leads to an investigation of human behavior, an understanding of the 
                               ramifications of prejudice, racism, and stereotyping, and an examination of what it means to be 
                               a responsible and respectful person, for the purposes of encouraging tolerance of diversity in a 
                               pluralistic society and for nurturing and protecting democratic values and institutions, 
                               including the policy, definition, and historical and current examples of anti-Semitism, as 
                               described in s. 1000.05(7), and the prevention of anti-Semitism. 
                          h.  The history of African Americans, including the history of African peoples before the political 
                               conflicts that led to the development of slavery, the passage to America, the enslavement 
                               experience, abolition, and the history and contributions of Americans of the African diaspora to 
                               society. Students shall develop an understanding of the ramifications of prejudice, racism, and 
                               stereotyping on individual freedoms, and examine what it means to be a responsible and 
                               respectful person, for the purpose of encouraging tolerance of diversity in a pluralistic society 
                               and for nurturing and protecting democratic values and institutions. Instruction shall include 
                               the roles and contributions of individuals from all walks of life and their endeavors to learn 
                               and thrive throughout history as artists, scientists, educators, businesspeople, influential 
                               thinkers, members of the faith community, and political and governmental leaders and the 
                               courageous steps they took to fulfill the promise of democracy and unite the nation. 
                               Instructional materials shall include the vital contributions of African Americans to build and 
                               strengthen American society and celebrate the inspirational stories of African Americans who 
                               prospered, even in the most difficult circumstances. Instructional personnel may facilitate 
                               discussions and use curricula to address, in an age-appropriate manner, how the individual 
                               freedoms of persons have been infringed by slavery, racial oppression, racial segregation, and 
                               racial discrimination, as well as topics relating to the enactment and enforcement of laws 
                               resulting in racial oppression, racial segregation, and racial discrimination and how recognition 
                               of these freedoms has overturned these unjust laws. However, classroom instruction and 
                               curriculum may not be used to indoctrinate or persuade students to a particular point of view

                                     The department shall prepare and offer standards and curriculum for the instruction required

                                 have made in serving our country and protecting democratic values worldwide. Such 
                                 instruction must occur on or before Medal of Honor Day, Veterans9 Day, and Memorial Day.  
                                 Members of the instructional staff are encouraged to use the assistance of local veterans and 
                                 Medal of Honor recipients when practicable.   
                                  
                                 Instructional programming that incorporates the values of the recipients of the Congressional

                                 school-wide character building and veteran awareness initiative meets this requirement. 
                  
                 Note:  References to Subsection (3) speak to the following: 
                  
                 Instruction and supporting materials on the topics enumerated in this section must be consistent with the 
                 following principles of individual freedom: 
                      •    No person is inherently racist, sexist, or oppressive, whether consciously or unconsciously, solely 
                           by virtue of his or her race or sex.   
                      •    No race is inherently superior to another race.  
                      •    No person should be discriminated against or receive adverse treatment solely or partly on the 
                           basis of race, color, national origin, religion, disability, or sex.   
                      •    Meritocracy or traits such as a hard work ethic are not racist but fundamental to the right to pursue 
                           happiness and be rewarded for industry.   
                      •    A person, by virtue of his or her race or sex, does not bear responsibility for actions committed in 
                           the past by other members of the same race or sex. 
                      •    A person should not be instructed that he or she must feel guilt, anguish, or other forms of 
                           psychological distress for actions, in which he or she played no part, committed in the past by 
                           other members of the same race or sex. 
                            
                      Instructional personnel may facilitate discussions and use curricula to address, in an age-appropriate 
                      manner, how the freedoms of persons have been infringed by sexism, slavery, racial oppression, racial 
                      segregation, and racial discrimination, including topics relating to the enactment and enforcement of 
                      laws resulting in sexism, racial oppression, racial segregation, and racial discrimination, including 
                      how recognition of these freedoms have overturned these unjust laws. However, classroom instruction 
                      and curriculum may not be used to indoctrinate or persuade students to a particular point of view 
                      inconsistent with the principles of this subsection or state academic standards. 
                       
                      Note: The State Board of Education shall develop or adopt a curriculum to inspire future generations 
                      through motivating stories of American history that demonstrate important life skills and the 
                      principles of individual freedom that enabled persons to prosper even in the most difficult 
                      circumstances. This curriculum shall be known as "Stories of Inspiration" and made available to 
                      schools to implement the requirements of subsection (3).

              teaching of reproductive health or any disease, including HIV/AIDS, its symptoms, development, and 
              treatment. A student so exempted may not be penalized by reason of that exemption. Course descriptions 
              for comprehensive health education shall not interfere with the local determination of appropriate 
              curriculum which reflects local values and concerns. 
               
              All instructional materials used to teach reproductive health or any disease, including HIV/AIDS, its 
              symptoms, development, and treatment, must be annually approved by the district school board in an 
              open, noticed public meeting.  The school district shall, on the district's website homepage, notify parents 
              of this right and the process to request an exemption. The homepage must include a link for a student's 
              parent to access and review the instructional materials used to teach the curriculum. 
               
              Classroom instruction by school personnel or third parties on sexual orientation or gender identity may 
              not occur in kindergarten through grade 3 or in a manner that is not age-appropriate or developmentally 
              appropriate for students in accordance with state standards. 
               
              Selecting & Using Non-Adopted Instructional Materials and School Library Media Center Books [F.S. 
              1006.28] 
              The 2022 Legislative Session (HB 1467) increases school district transparency and accountability for 
              selecting and using non-adopted instructional material and school library materials.  Administrative 
              procedures for the following actions will be followed beginning in the 2022-2023 school year:

                       appropriate materials and library resources. 
                  •    Each book made available to students through a school district library media center or included in 
                       a recommended or assigned school or grade-level reading list will be selected by a school district 
                       employee who holds a valid educational media specialist certificate, regardless whether the book is 
                       purchased, donated, or otherwise made available to students. 
                  •    District-wide procedures for developing library media center collections are implemented and

                       instruction). 
                  •    The district will provide public review access to all non-adopted instructional materials (excluding 
                       teacher editions) in accordance with s.1006.283(2)(b)8.a. and request school board approval prior to 
                       purchase. 
                  •    The district will annually report to the Commissioner of Education, and identify in the 
                       superintendent9s annual certification of approved instructional materials programs, materials for

              Computer Science and Technology Education [F.S.1007.2616] 
              Middle and high schools in each district, including combination schools in which any of grades 6-12 are 
              taught, must provide an opportunity for students to enroll in a computer science course as identified in 
              the Florida Department of Education9s Course Code Directory.  If a school does not offer an identified 
              course, the district will provide students access to a computer science course through Charlotte Virtual 
              School, Florida Virtual School or through other means. 
               
              Grade Level Classification and Placement 
              A student9s learning path is unique to that student9s academic needs and college or career interests.  
              Students will be considered freshmen, sophomores, juniors, seniors and fifth-year seniors based on the 
              credits they have achieved.  
               
                  ➢  Grade Level Classification and Promotion within High School 
                  •    Under normal circumstances, students are classified at the end of each school year. 
                  •    In order to be classified as a sophomore (grade 10 student), the student must have completed one 
                       year of high school with a minimum of five credits to include one credit in mathematics and one 
                       credit in English.

                       of high school and been awarded eleven credits to include two (of four) in mathematics and two 
                       (of four) in English. 
                  •    In order to be classified as a senior (grade 12 student), the student must have completed three 
                       years of high school and been awarded a minimum of 16 credits, or at the beginning of the third

                       ACCEL Option. 
                  •    Students in regular education programs not reaching graduation status in four years (<fifth-year 
                       senior=) shall be provided the opportunity of a fifth year to meet the district9s graduation 
                       requirements.  Remediation shall be provided to assist the student passing the state-required 
                       assessments necessary to earn a standard diploma. 
                  •    High schools may promote retained students from grade 9 to grade 10, grade 10 to grade 11, or 
                       grade 11 to grade 12 at the end of the first semester upon documentation of the awarding of 
                       required make-up credit(s). 
                  •    A junior who is enrolled in a 24-credit diploma program may be moved to senior status at the end 
                       of the first semester if enrolled in the necessary coursework to graduate in the spring. 
                        
                  Note: Programs at The Academy have a different grade level classification which is dependent upon 
                  the needs of its student population.

               When students do not meet classification requirements, they may only proceed to the next grade level 
               on the recommendation of the Student Assistance Team and the approval of the Principal. A Certified 
               School Counselor9s recommendation to modify grade level classification procedures of any 
               particular student must have the prior permission of the school9s Principal or designee. 
            
               For courses which result in a state standardized end of course assessment (EOC), any teacher-made 
               assessment administered during midterm exams or final exams week will not be cumulative in 
               nature and will be factored as a quarter 2 or a quarter 4 grade.  The state standardized EOC will 
               calculate at 30% of the student9s final course grade, pursuant to F.S. 1003.4282: Requirements for a 
               standard high school diploma. 
            
               ➢  Placement for Students with Disabilities 
                   Students with disabilities shall be placed in appropriate courses as dictated by their Individual 
                   Education Plan (IEP).

                   school and the support information provided that documents student progress and mastery of 
                   standards.  SBE Rule 6A-1.09941 State Uniform Transfer of Students in Middle Grades and High School 
                   shall be the governing rule and guiding policy when making decisions on enrollment and

                   Florida Statute 1002.41 defines home education programs. Students entering Charlotte County 
                   Public Schools and requesting credit for a home education program must follow the Alternative 
                   Validation Procedure specified by 6A-1.09941, F.A.C., State Uniform Transfer of Students in Middle 
                   Grades and High School.  Students seeking initial placement in grades 9-12 from a home education 
                   program or an unaccredited charter, public or private school shall be evaluated by the local school 
                   to determine the most appropriate grade level placement. Criteria to be considered shall include 
                   age and maturity, standardized achievement test results, state assessment results, progress as it 
                   relates to the Florida Standards and benchmarks, previous records from public or private schools 
                   and evidence from the student's portfolio of work and achievement while in home education.  
            
                   In no instance shall the placement be automatic, based solely on the recommendation of the 
                   unaccredited public or private school, home educator, or age. The placement decision is subject to 
                   review and revision after school personnel have had the opportunity to observe the student's 
                   work. Should there be reasonable suspicion of a student9s grades, initial assessments may be 
                   required to determine grade placement.

                       the Florida DOE Course Code Directory. If a letter grade is assigned, that grade is entered in our 
                       system, even if the grading scale from which the student transferred is not equivalent to Charlotte 
                       County Public School9s grading scale. If only a numerical grade is provided and no grading scale is 
                       provided, the Charlotte County Public School9s grading scale is applied to the student record. 
               
                  ➢  Promotion of Late-in-the-Year Transfer Students 
                       The promotion of students transferring into Charlotte County Public Schools during the last

                       does not possess an official transcript, or the student is a home education student, credits shall be 
                       validated through performance during the first grading period.  A student transferring into a 
                       school shall be placed at the appropriate sequential course level. To receive credit, a student 
                       should have a minimum grade point average of 2.0 at the end of the first grading period for each 
                       course.

                       under School Board Policies in comparable periods of time. 
               
                  •    No transfer student shall receive a high school diploma without having passed all required 
                       Florida state assessments or earned the applicable concordant or comparative scores unless the 
                       student demonstrated mastery on a reciprocal exam from the state of origin. 
               
                  •    Transfer students shall be required to complete graduation requirements based upon their grade 
                       placement. Such requirements for graduation shall not be retroactive for transfer students, 
                       provided the student has met the requirements of the school district or state from which he or 
                       she is transferring. However, students may be required to complete the maximum number of 
                       credits a student may earn during regular full terms each year if their overall high school 
                       credit total will be less than the credits normally required of Charlotte County Public Schools 
                       students to graduate. 
              Beginning with the 2012-13 school year, if a student transfers to a Florida public high school from an 
              out of country, out of state, a private school, or a home education program and the student9s transcript 
              shows a mathematics credit in a course that requires passage of a statewide, standardized assessment in 
              order to earn a standard high school diploma, the student must pass the assessment unless the student 
              earned a comparative score, passes a statewide assessment in that subject administered by the 
              transferring entity, or passed the statewide assessment the transferring entity uses to satisfy the 
              requirement. If a student9s transcript shows a credit in high school reading or English Language Arts II or 
              III, the student must take and pass the grade 10 FAST ELA or earn a concordant score on the SAT or ACT 
              as specified by state board rule. 
               
              Class Enrollment Requirements 
              Every student in grades 9-12 must be scheduled for a full day of classes in each semester.  Exceptions 
              might include home school, hospital/homebound, early admission under dual enrollment, and alternative 
              school programs.  Other exceptions must be referred to the Assistant Superintendent for Learning. 
               
              In addition to the credits available during the school day, in the course of the school year students may 
              earn the following credits: 
                        •    Two credits per year may be earned outside the regular school day for courses 
                             where the student has received a grade of <D= or <F.= This is subject to principal and 
                             district office approval of the course. 
                              
              Any special hardship cases involving credit recovery of more than two credits per year must be referred 
              to the Assistant Superintendent for Learning. 
                              
                        •    Students  who  have  the  opportunity  to  accelerate  their  learning  through  special 
                             courses must have principal approval BEFORE enrolling in such courses if they wish 
                             to receive high school credit. 
                              
              Virtual School Education [F.S. 1002.455, 1003.4282] 
              At least one eligible course of the required 24 graduation credits must be completed through online 
              learning beginning with the 2011-2012 ninth grade cohort group.  Charlotte County Public Schools has put 
              into place several options to assist and ensure that students are able to meet this requirement.  In all these

              options, students are strongly encouraged to meet with their Certified School Counselor to determine 
              their best route in meeting the online course requirement.  Charlotte County Public Schools strongly 
              recommends that this requirement be met prior to the end of the junior year (grade 11).  The online course 
              graduation requirement does not apply to a student who has an individual education plan under s. 
              1003.57 which indicates that an online or blended-learning course would be inappropriate, or to an out-of-
              state transfer student who is enrolled in a Florida high school and has 1 academic year or less remaining 
              in high school. 
               
                  •    Online driver9s education courses can meet the online course requirement for graduation 
                       purposes.   
                  •    Charlotte Virtual School (CVS) is the provider of first choice for virtual instruction; however, in 
                       situations in which CVS cannot fulfill the need, students may qualify to access the services of 
                       Florida Virtual School (FLVS).   
                  •    Students involved in credit retrieval programs may also be eligible to complete the online learning 
                       requirements through the district9s approved online credit retrieval program.  
                  •    Students may complete this requirement through an online dual enrollment course.  
                  •    Important Note:  House Bill 7029 amended F.S. 1003.4282 to add that a district school board may 
                       offer students two additional options to satisfy the online course graduation requirement.  A 
                       student may satisfy this requirement with completion of a course in which a student earns a 
                       nationally recognized industry certification in information technology that is identified on the 
                       CAPE Industry Certification Funding List pursuant to s. 1008.44 or passage of the information 
                       technology certification examination without enrollment in or completion of the corresponding 
                       course or courses.  In addition, passage of an online content assessment, without enrollment in or 
                       completion of the corresponding course or courses, as applicable, by which the student 
                       demonstrates skills and competency in locating information and applying technology for 
                       instructional purposes.  A CAPE Digital Tool certificate does not satisfy this requirement. 
                  •    An online course taken in grade 6, grade 7, or grade 8 fulfills this requirement.  
                  •    Computer labs have been established at each high school to assist in student access to virtual 
                       courses.  Students enrolled in these labs will be held to daily class attendance requirements even if 
                       the course is completed prior to the end of the enrolled semester. 
                  •    Once a semester has begun, a student may not withdraw from a school course to enroll in the same 
                       course online without administrative approval. 
                  •    Students may not simultaneously be placed in the same course concurrently at a district high

              Academically Challenging Curriculum to Enhance Learning (ACCEL) options are educational options that 
              provide academically challenging curriculum or accelerated instruction to eligible public school students 
              in kindergarten through grade 12.  At a minimum, each school must offer the following ACCEL options:  
                  •    whole-grade and midyear promotion;  
                  •    subject-matter acceleration;

              or Biology), an Advanced Placement Examination, or a College Level Examination Program (CLEP).  
              Notwithstanding s. 1003.436, a school district shall award course credit to a student who is not enrolled in 
              the course, or who has not completed the course, if the student attains a passing score on the 
              corresponding end-of-course assessment, Advanced Placement Examination or CLEP. The school district 
              shall permit a public school or home education student who is not enrolled in the course, or who has not 
              completed the course, to take the assessment or examination during the regular administration of the 
              assessment or examination.  Students wishing to utilize CAP through an Advanced Placement 
              examination or CLEP are highly encouraged to speak to their Certified School Counselor as implications 
              to the timeliness of awarding course credit upon the availability of certain Advanced Placement 
              Examinations scores may have impact on graduation status, GPA calculation, diploma awards and

               ➢  Advanced International Certificate of Education (AICE) 
                   The University of Cambridge, England, sponsors the AICE program which is offered at select 
                   Charlotte County Public Schools9 high schools, when available. Cambridge AICE is an 
                   international curriculum and examination system. Its strengths lie in the flexibility and structure of 
                   the curriculum and encouraging in-depth, working knowledge of each subject and essay-based 
                   examinations of knowledge and skill mastery. Alongside in-depth understanding of a variety of 
                   subjects, students also need to master a broader range of skills critical for success in university 
                   study and employment. These essential skills include the ability to: think critically, carry out 
                   independent research, evaluate arguments, communicate clear and well-reasoned arguments and 
                   understand global issues from multiple perspectives. Starting in 2017, attainment of the Cambridge 
                   AICE Diploma will require students to pass AS Level Global Perspectives and Research which 
                   helps develop these essential skills This evolution will help higher education institutions identify 
                   students with the type of cohesive academic experience and higher-order thinking and 
                   communication skills that are associated with distinguished achievement at university. 
            
                   Within AICE, there are more than 40 subjects from four subject group areas:  
                   1. Mathematics and Sciences  
                   2. Languages  
                   3. Arts and Humanities  
                   4. Interdisciplinary and Skills-Based  
            
                   Most subjects are studied either at the Advanced (A) Level or at the Advanced Subsidiary (AS) 
                   Level.  Both Cambridge International AS and A Levels are considered college-level courses of 
                   study and students passing these examinations with a Cambridge grade of E or higher may receive 
                   up to 45 hours of college credit or advanced standing based on their scores in these examinations 
                   from universities throughout the United States and all public universities and colleges in Florida. 
                   Credit is typically awarded based on each subject and examination grade earned.  
            
                   Section 1003.4282, F.S., defines the options for earning a high school diploma stating that 
                   graduation requires successful completion of either a minimum of 24 academic credits in grades 9-
                   12, an IB curriculum or an AICE curriculum. To be considered for an AICE Diploma, students 
                   must earn the equivalent of a minimum of seven credits by passing a combination of examinations 
                   at either double credit (A Level) or single credit (AS Level).

           Dual Enrollment Programs & Articulation Agreements [F.S. 1007.271(1)(2), 1007.27(4)] 
           The Dual Enrollment program is the enrollment of an eligible secondary student (grades 6-12) or home 
           education student in a postsecondary course creditable toward high school completion and a career 
           certificate or an associate or baccalaureate degree.

           A student who is enrolled in postsecondary instruction that is not creditable toward a high school 
           diploma may not be classified as a Dual Enrollment student. 
           If the student is projected to graduate from high school before the scheduled completion date of a 
           postsecondary course, the student may not register for that course through Dual Enrollment. 
             
           Students dually enrolled in the regular school year are exempt from payment of all application, 
           registration, tuition, textbook costs, and laboratory fees. Home education students and charter school 
           students may participate in the dual enrollment program.  Students enrolled in home education will not 
           be liable for the cost of instructional materials.  Non-public and charter school students are responsible 
           for the cost of their instructional materials.  Transportation is the responsibility of all students. 
            
           Students are not to enroll in a college course during the summer months nor are they to enroll after 
           regular school hours with a full schedule of courses during the school day.  If a student enrolls as such, 
           all cost associated with the course may be at the obligation of the student and course work will be at the 
           risk of not counting towards fulfilling graduation requirements.  
            
           Dual Enrollment shall be offered on the high school campus whenever possible.  Students should take DE 
           courses on their zoned high school campus if they are offered there.  Dual enrolled courses receive the 
           same weighting for GPA calculation as Advanced International Certificate of Education (AICE) and 
           Advanced Placement (AP). 
            
           The Dual Enrollment program is designed to expand the learning opportunities for qualified 
           students. Qualified students who wish to enroll in college level or technical courses and who need 
           credits to meet high school graduation requirements may enroll in approved post- secondary

           courses.  These courses are taught as part of the high school curriculum and follow the curricular 
           guidelines established by the high school under Articulation Agreements with Charlotte Technical 
           College, Florida SouthWestern State College, State College of Florida - Manatee-Sarasota, and Florida 
           Gulf Coast University. Students must meet enrollment criteria specific to each dual enrollment course, 
           and upon successful completion of each course will receive both high school and post-secondary 
           credit. The number of college credits a student may earn is determined by the college or university.   
           
           Students interested in Dual Enrollment opportunities are encouraged to speak to their school9s Certified 
           School Counselor and refer to the various articulated acceleration plans between Charlotte County 
           Public Schools and the appropriate state college or university to carefully determine the criteria that is 
           required for Dual Enrollment.   
            
           A Dual Enrollment status is assigned to an eligible secondary school student who has certified that s/he 
           is seeking an associated degree or vocational certification and who is enrolled in a college post-
           secondary course that is creditable toward the high school diploma.  A Dual Enrollment student must be 
           concurrently enrolled in a high school program. 
              
           Dual Enrollment courses will be graded using the college standards for grading. The Dual Enrollment 
           grade will be reported the same for the high school report card/transcript and the college transcript.  
           Dual Enrollment courses are part of a student9s permanent college transcript and are calculated into the 
           student9s permanent postsecondary GPA. Poor performance as a Dual Enrollment student can ultimately 
           impact one9s postsecondary career, including academic standing and financial aid eligibility.  
            
           All  instructional  materials  are  the  property  of  the  Charlotte  County  Public  Schools.  The  student  is 
           responsible for returning the materials to the home school principal or designee.  Materials should be 
           returned in the same condition as when initially issued to the student.

                       This is a structured high school acceleration program in which a cohort of students is enrolled full 
                       time in postsecondary courses toward an associate degree. The early college program must 
                       prioritize courses applicable as general education core courses under s. 1007.25 for an associate 
                       degree or a baccalaureate degree.  Located on a student9s high school campus that is a 
                       geographically isolated area from the College9s main District campus, the Early College Program 
                       follows a school-within-a-school model that allows students to complete an Associates of Arts 
                       degree. The district, college, and an approved SACS Prospectus is required before implementation.  
                       Charlotte County Public Schools will not establish a Collegiate Institute under the current 
                       articulated and acceleration plan with FSW. A charter school may execute a contract directly with 
                       the local Florida College System institution or another institution as authorized to establish an 
                       early college program at a mutually agreed upon location. 
                        
                  5.  Early Admissions Program - The Early Admissions Program is a full-time Dual Enrollment 
                       Program providing high school students the opportunity to earn both high school and college 
                       credits simultaneously by taking college courses on the College9s campus or online, but not 
                       through concurrent courses. Students may continue to participate in extra-curricular activities at 
                       their sending school and/ or at the College. The Early Admissions Program processes are the same 
                       to that of Dual Enrollment with the following exceptions.

                       Enrolled students must submit any request for accommodations to the Office for Adaptive Services 
                       on the appropriate campus for consideration. Individuals with a disability must provide recent 
                       documentation from a qualified, licensed professional that speaks to the specific disability and the 
                       requested  accommodation.  Requests  for  accommodations  must  be  specific  to  the  documented 
                       needs. Once a student has been established with the office, it is the student9s responsibility to 
                       request accommodations each semester that the student is enrolled.  
                  •    Individual Education Plans (IEPs) are not acceptable forms of primary documentation. IEPs are 
                       plans which were structured and agreed to with that school at the time they were written. They are 
                       not binding agreements with Florida SouthWestern State College. A valid IEP with the school 
                       district does not make the student eligible for college accommodations. Students with an IEP must 
                       request an accommodation. Approved district accommodations may be helpful in determining the 
                       level of support and types of accommodations which were provided to a student in the past. 
                  •    Students who take courses concurrently, and have approved high school accommodations, may 
                       not be supported by the College if issues arise and the student has not self-identified through the 
                       College9s process. 
                  •    Dual Enrollment Program students and their parents will be offered the College9s Accelerated

                       webinars to thoroughly explain college-level course expectations.  
                  •    Dual Enrollment Program students have the same rights and considerations of all college students, 
                       as determined by the College9s Students Rights and Responsibilities, found in the College9s

                       Program courses will be awarded in accordance with the aforementioned agreement. The Florida

                  •    Since students enrolled in the Dual Enrollment Program are meeting high school graduation 
                       requirements while taking college courses, the College accepts the signature of the School 
                       Designee as decisive regarding suitability of courses and/or the applicability towards high school 
                       graduation. 
                  •    All courses must be at least three (3) credits and be taken for a letter grade, not including required 
                       co-requisite courses.

                       elective credits toward high school graduation requirements. All credits not earned but attempted 
                       must be entered on the high school transcript. 
                  •    Dual Enrollment Program courses must apply directly toward the student9s general requirements 
                       for high school graduation as outlined in 1003.4282, F.S., pursuant to 1007.271, F.S.  
                  •    Participating in any Dual Enrollment Program course creates a college transcript for the student. 
                       All grades, including withdrawals, will be posted to the student9s permanent academic record. 
                       Low grades in college courses may adversely affect subsequent admission to public or private 
                       colleges and universities, as well as financial aid eligibility and/or availability. 
                  •    College credits earned through an articulated accelerated mechanism, as defined in the articulation 
                       agreement from 1007.27 F.S., are not calculated towards the excess hour requirement in 1009.286, 
                       F.S. which states students are required to pay an excess hour surcharge for each credit hour in 
                       excess of the number of credit hours required to complete the baccalaureate degree program in 
                       which a student is enrolled. 
                  •    Students earning credit under various acceleration programs are guaranteed transferability of 
                       credit under provisions of the State Articulation Agreement in cases where the student completes 
                       <general education requirements= and/or the Associate of Arts degree and is transferring to a state 
                       university in Florida. 
                  •    Students earning college credit through the Dual Enrollment Program in courses outside of the 
                       general education categories or outside of the AA degree requirements are not guaranteed 
                       transferability of credit and will be evaluated by the individual college or university policy 
                       involved. 
                  •    In accordance with 1007.271 (18), F.S., all courses taken through the Dual Enrollment Program 
                       must be weighted the same as Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate, and Advanced 
                       International Certificate of Education courses when weighted grade point averages are calculated. 
                       Alternative grade calculation or weighting systems that discriminate against courses offered in the 
                       Dual Enrollment program are prohibited.

                       Principal.  
                  •    The School Designee will notify the College, in writing, of the reasons why the Principal wishes to 
                       exempt a student from the state criteria. 
                  •    The Director of Accelerated Pathways reviews all exemption requests and makes a 
                       recommendation to the Dean of the School of Education. 
                  •    The Vice Provost of Academic Affairs is authorized to review and determine waiver eligibility in

                       School Designee of the approval or disapproval of the exemption. 
                  •    Students whose IEP requires special education, transition planning, transition services or related 
                       services through the age of 21 may defer receipt of their standard diplomas, defined by 300.43 of

                            Homework 
                            Homework is an extension of learning and is important for improved student achievement.  Each school is 
                            expected to have homework guidelines tailored to its student population including a system for reviewing 
                            homework in an effort to promote learning.  The following guiding principles regarding homework shall 
                            be considered:  
                                        •        Homework is designed as an extension of school class work for the purpose of practice and 
                                                 reinforcement of classroom learning. 
                                        •        Homework is purposeful and meaningful. 
                                        •        Students should be able to successfully complete homework independently. 
                                        •        There is a system for reviewing homework assignments that promotes learning. 
                                        •        Parents shall be fully informed of the school9s homework policy. 
                                        •        It is expected that parents will instill in their children the responsibility to see that 
                                                 homework is completed and returned.

           The book Classroom Instruction that Works:  Research-Based Strategies for Increasing Student 
           Achievement by Marzano, Pickering, and Pollick (2001) identifies nine (9) instructional strategies that 
           have a probability of enhancing student achievement at all levels.  The following strategies are significant: 
           1. Identifying similarities and differences  
           2. Summarizing and note taking  
           3. Reinforcing efforts and providing recognition  
           4. Homework and practice  
           5. Non-linguistic representations  
           6. Cooperative learning  
           7. Setting objectives and providing feedback  
           8. Generating and testing hypotheses  
           9. Questions, cues and advance organizers  
            
           As homework is a proven strategy in improving student achievement, it is important to look at the 
           recommendations from the research. The research study identifies four areas to guide teachers in 
           assigning homework:  
            
           1. The significance of homework on student achievement  
           2. The purposes for homework - Homework should have a specific purpose, be familiar and connected to the 
           standards being studied, and be relevant. The purpose could be for students to (1) practice or rehearse, to begin (2) 
           preparation for the introduction of new content, or to (3) deepen knowledge and understanding (Marzano, 2001). 
           3. The importance of providing feedback to students - According to the research, homework must be 
           commented on to be of value. When the teacher provides specific feedback on student work in writing, it enhances 
           their achievement by 30 percentile points (Marzano, 2001). When it is checked by the teacher, even if checked 
           through whole group discussion and participation, there is a gain of 28 percentile points in learning. It is 
           recommended that teachers check and discuss homework to gather data and reteach as necessary. 
           4.  Parental involvement  
            
           Academic Honesty 
           As students progress through school, they are reminded that academic honesty is an expectation for all 
           students. Instances of cheating in any form will be considered a critical breach of character and integrity as 
           well as a serious violation of the Code of Student Conduct.  Cheating is defined as <The inappropriate and 
           deliberate distribution or use of information, notes, materials, or work of another person, used as your own, in the 
           completion of an academic exam, test or assignment.=  Cheating violations may result in the loss of eligibility 
           for local scholarships, loss of honors, awards, and membership in extra-curricular activities. In addition, a 
           student whose actions enable others to cheat (e.g., stealing or selling a test) will be considered to have 
           committed a particularly serious violation of the Code of Student Conduct which will result in the 
           strongest of consequences related to the nature of the incident including, if applicable, referral to law 
           enforcement.   Parents and students are encouraged to consult the Code of Student Conduct for further 
           clarification. Please refer to the Code of Student Conduct on the district website. 
            
           GRADING AND REPORTING PROCEDURES 
            
           Charlotte County Public Schools offers a standards-based curriculum and strives for consistency so that a 
           course grade at one school equates to the same course grade and level of mastery at another school.  The 
           curriculum in all schools in Charlotte County is based on the State Academic Standards and B.E.S.T 
           Standards.  These standards specify what students should know and be able to do.  In a standards-based

                system, grades should be an indicator of the level of mastery of benchmarks and standards during and at 
                the conclusion of a learning sequence. 
                 
                Grading Criteria 
                High school students shall be expected to demonstrate achievement of the essential concepts (the 
                standards) in the core subject areas.  Student progress reporting will include mastery of standards data 
                in English Language Arts, mathematics, science, and social studies.  Key points regarding grading 
                criteria include the following: 
                •         Grading criteria must be based on a variety of learning activities and assessments which 
                          may include the following: 
                                    o         Classroom work 
                                    o         Projects/presentations  
                                    o         Summative assessments 3 assessments that are administered at the end of a learning 
                                              sequence after ample practice or rehearsal of essential knowledge.  These assessments 
                                              indicate mastery of benchmarks and standards.  Examples of summative assessments 
                                              include: 
                                                      ▪           Chapter tests

                                    o         Formative assessments 3 assessments which are frequent, in-progress checks for 
                                              understanding, on a regular basis used to inform instruction, to provide ongoing and helpful 
                                              feedback, to alert teachers to what challenges students are still facing, and to inform students 
                                              about where they are in relation to mastery of the standard.  Examples of formative 
                                              assessments include: 
                                                     ▪            Formal district-created formative assessments administered under

                      Teachers will provide opportunities for all students to demonstrate mastery of course-specific 
                      benchmarks and standards as outlined in the state course descriptions.   
                           
                      Teachers will ensure that progress monitoring reporting include mastery of standards data in ELA, 
                      mathematics, social studies, and science. 
                       
                      Teachers are not to use the results of district-wide progress monitoring Interim Assessments as a

                Teachers will not include conduct, effort, or attendance in the academic grade of a course.  Conduct 
                and effort reflect student work habits, not academic achievement of course-specific benchmarks and 
                standards, and therefore should not be included in the academic grade. 
                    
                Teachers will advise students of the grading criteria used in the school and in class at the beginning 
                of the course of study.  Grading criteria is to be addressed in all course syllabi. 
                    
                Teachers will adhere to the Charlotte County Public Schools9 <35-35-30= Grade Distribution 
                Matrix when calculating and posting final semester grades for all courses.  
                    
                Teachers will ensure that all syllabi distributed and/or communicated to students and 
                parents, for the purposes of setting guidelines and responsibilities within the domain of 
                make-up work policies and procedures, will comply with the Code of Student Conduct. 
                 
                Teachers shall be responsible for assuring student achievement of the student performance 
                standards which are incorporated into their course standards. 
                    
           State Grading Scale [F.S.1003.437] 
           Charlotte County Public Schools adheres to the following grading scale which is used in all middle and 
           high schools: 
               Grade            Percentage            Quality Point Value                   Progress

           Grade Point Average 
           Grade point averages (GPA) shall be computed by grade weight averages. A numerical grade weight shall 
           be determined by assigning a numerical weight to the alphabetical equivalent of the student9s final grade 
           in each course and multiplying it by its credit value. 
           A student9s overall (cumulative) grade point average shall be computed by adding together the grade 
           point average for each course and dividing it by the total number of credits attempted. GPA must be 
           computed to four decimal places (e.g., 1.9555 cannot be rounded up to 2.0). When the grade forgiveness 
           policy is used, only the higher grade will be averaged into the GPA. 
           All semester grades are averaged to determine a student9s cumulative grade point average (GPA) and 
           class rank. Class rank will be calculated on both an un-weighted and weighted basis. 
            
           Any course grade not replaced according to the grade forgiveness policy shall be included in the 
           calculation of the cumulative GPA required for graduation. All courses, however, must be shown on the 
           student transcript.

            Grades in the Extended Period 
            The extended period will follow all guidelines and policies outlined in the CCPS Student Progression Plan 
            for regular class periods. Letter grades are averaged to determine semester final grades as follows: 
            First 4½ weeks (equivalent to 9 weeks)                                35% 
            Second 4½ weeks (equivalent to 9 weeks)                               35% 
            End of the first nine weeks exam (equivalent to the semester exam)    30% 
            The same procedure will be followed for the second nine-week period to complete second semester. 
            Progress reports are likewise issued at appropriate times. In addition, the semester exam waiver policy is 
            applicable in the same manner as for regular classes. 
             
            Required Grade Point Average [F.S. 1003.4282(6)(a)] 
            To receive a standard high school diploma, a cumulative minimal GPA of 2.0 or above on a 4.0 scale is 
            required.  Any course grade not replaced according to the grade forgiveness policy shall be included in the 
            calculation of the cumulative grade point average required for graduation. 
            Any student whose cumulative GPA drops below a 2.5 on a 4.0 scale will be considered an at-risk 
            student  and  parents  will  be  notified  in  writing  as  to  the  student9s  risk  of  not  meeting  graduation 
            requirements. 
            Any student who has a cumulative GPA below 2.0 will be provided special academic assistance to aid in 
            meeting the GPA requirement. In such cases, a Progress Monitoring Plan providing the needed 
            assistance will be developed and implemented. This may be accomplished through one or more of the 
            following: grade forgiveness policies, second chance option, and/or modified curriculum. 
             
            Courses Earning Weighted Grade Point Average 
            All courses designated as <level 3= in the Florida Department of Education9s Course Code Directory are to 
            be assigned an honors9 weight (.50), unless that course is AP, DE, AICE, or IB.  These courses are to receive 
            a full 1.0 weight.  
             
            Discussion and decision regarding the weighting of courses resides with the Assistant Superintendent for 
            Learning and is guided by the Florida Department of Education9s Course Code Directory with feedback 
            and input from the Director of ICS and/or the school principal. 
            1.0 Additional Point Value for 
                 •    All courses at the Advanced Placement, AICE, IB, Dual Credit, or CTC Career-Dual level. 
            .50 Additional Point Value for 
                 •    Core courses (Math, English, Science, Social Studies) at the honors level as designated in 
                        the Course Code Directory (this includes courses identified as Pre-AICE);

            Grade Forgiveness Policy [F.S. 1003.4282(5)] 
            The district9s Grade Forgiveness Policy is designed to assist students in meeting graduation requirements, 
            including a minimum grade point average and successful completion of academic credit.  An evaluation 
            of a student9s transcript to identify and correct issues that could potentially keep the student from 
            graduating on time must be performed by the Principal or designee throughout the student9s high school 
            enrollment.  Transcript reviews occurring only in the student9s senior year is unacceptable practice since 
            this will significantly shorten the time and opportunity for the student to correct any deficiencies required

              to earn a standard diploma.  Any questions regarding the district9s Grade Forgiveness Policy are to be 
              directed to the Assistant Superintendent for Learning.  Schools do not have the authority to modify a 
              student9s transcript without written permission from the Assistant Superintendent for Learning.  
                     
                    All courses and grades, whether forgiven or not, must appear on the student9s transcript. The Grade 
                    Forgiveness Policy does not provide the school the authority to alter a student9s record or to delete 
                    the forgiven course and grade. 
                    Each school is responsible for keeping a record of courses taken and a record of achievement.  
                    Student records, including the student9s transcript, cannot be altered at any time unless it has been 
                    determined that the information is inaccurate. Transcript maintenance procedures are to be followed 
                    by the school as directed, in writing, by the Assistant Superintendent for Learning.

                                                  o  Yes. All courses and grades, whether forgiven or not, must appear on the 
                                                      student’s transcript. The Grade Forgiveness Policy does not provide the school 
                                                      the authority to alter a student’s record or to delete the forgiven course and

                                                    •  Each school is responsible for keeping a record of courses taken and a record of 
                                                         achievement.

                                                         is earned to apply grade forgiveness. 
                                                          
                    In order to improve GPA and assist with graduation requirements, a student may retake a course in 
                    which a <D= or <F= was attained. In cases where a course is no longer offered or where scheduling 
                    does not permit, the closest equivalent may be substituted upon written approval by the Assistant 
                    Superintendent for Learning. 
                           
                    Courses must be taken in the proper sequence as much as possible. 
                     
                    Forgiveness policies for required courses shall be limited to replacing a grade of <D= or <F= with a 
                    grade of <C= or higher earned subsequently in the same or comparable course. 
                     
                    Forgiveness policies for elective courses shall be limited to replacing a grade of <D= or <F= with a 
                    grade of <C= or higher earned subsequently in another course. 
                     
                    The only exception to these forgiveness policies shall be made for a student in the middle grades who 
                    takes any high school course for high school credit and earns a grade of <C,= <D,= or <F.=  In such 
                    cases, the district forgiveness policy must allow the replacement of the grade with a grade of <C= or 
                    higher earned subsequently in the same or comparable course. 
               
                    In all cases of grade forgiveness, only the higher grade shall be used in the calculation of the student9s 
                    grade point average.  Any course grade not replaced according to the district forgiveness policy shall 
                    be included in the calculation of the cumulative grade point average required for graduation.

                    The district9s Grade Forgiveness Policy will adhere to the FDOE9s stance that an <elective is an 
                    elective= regardless of content area. Electives are considered comparable.  
                     
                                                                                  th
                              ✓  For example:  A student takes French I in 9  grade and earns an <F= or a <D= in Semester 1 and 
                                   Semester 2.  The student then takes TV Production in the 11th grade and earns a grade of <C= or 
                                   higher in each semester.  The school can <exclude= the <F= and <D= in French I and <include= the 
                                   TV Production grades.  The <F= and <D= will no longer be calculated in the student’s GPA.  This 
                                   is acceptable under the Grade Forgiveness Policy, per Florida Statute, noting that, for elective 
                                   courses, the school is limited to replacing a grade of <D= or <F= with a grade of <C= or higher 
                                   earned subsequently in another course.  Since French I and TV Productions are different courses, 
                                   the grade forgiveness policy applies.  And, since Florida Statute states <subsequently= and not 
                                   <consecutively,= it is acceptable to apply grade forgiveness even in situations when the student 
                                   did not earn the higher grade in a course immediately following the school year of the course the 
                                   school wishes to forgive. 
               
                    When applying the district9s Grade Forgiveness Policy, it is acceptable to forgive a grade at a 
                    semester level only since the district issues credit on a semester basis.  In other words, if one semester 
                    (Sem. 1) of a course is a <D= or a <F,= and the other semester (Sem. 2) of that same course is a <C= or 
                    higher, the school may apply grade forgiveness if another comparable course is taken subsequently in 
                    a later school year, and forgive the <D= or <F= of that one semester (Sem. 1) from the GPA with a 
                    grade of <C= or higher. 
                     
                              ✓  For example:  A student successfully completes Liberal Arts Math 1, Sem 1 & 2, with a grade of 
                                   <C= or higher.  The student has 3 grades of <F= in one or the other semester in Financial Algebra, 
                                   Math for College Readiness, and Liberal Arts 2. 
                                         •   Question:  
                                                  Can the corresponding semester credit be used to replace credit in the failed course?   
                                         •   Answer:   
                                                  First, it needs to be confirmed that the Liberal Arts 1 course was taken subsequently 
                                         from the failed math course.  Never apply grade forgiveness using a grade of a course that 
                                         was taken prior to the course earning the D or F.   
                                         When applying the district grade forgiveness policy, it is acceptable to forgive a grade at a 
                                semester level only since the district issues credit on a semester basis.  In other words, if one semester 
                                (Sem. 1) of a course is a <D= or a <F,= and the other semester (Sem. 2) of that same course is a <C= 
                                or higher, grade forgiveness can be applied if another comparable course is taken subsequently in a 
                                later school year, and forgive the <D= or <F= of that one semester (Sem. 1) from the GPA with a 
                                grade of <C= or higher. 
                     
                                In this situation, the school may apply the Semester 1 grade of C or higher of the Liberal Arts Math 1 
                                course to Semester 1 of any of the three math failed courses since they are, according to the Florida 
                                Department of Education’s Course Code Directory, all level 2 courses with a MA (math) graduation 
                                subject. The school may do the same with Semester 2 of the Liberal Arts Math 1 course to Semester 2 
                                of the other failed math course.

                The district9s Grade Forgiveness Policy will allow a general level (non-weighted) class to replace a 
                failed  honors9 (.5 weighted) course. The general course and the grade obtained will replace the 
                honors9 course. The original honors9 grade will not be used to compute the student9s GPA. 
                  
               ➢     Grade Forgiveness/Credit Recovery and Dual Enrollment:   
                The district9s  Grade  Forgiveness  Policy  does  not  apply  to  college-level  dual  enrollment  courses 
                (contained within the Statewide Course Numbering System) as these courses are not comparable to 
                a course in the K-12 Course Code Directory. For example, the high school transcript must not reflect 
                grade forgiveness applied to a <D= or <F= grade earned in an Advanced Placement course with a 
                dual enrollment Course, and vice versa.  In addition, the high school transcript must not reflect 
                grade forgiveness of one dual enrollment course for another.   However, F.S. 1009.285 and rule 6A-
                14.0301, F.A.C. authorizes a Florida College System Institution to allow the forgiveness of <D= or <F= 
                grades.  It is at the discretion of the college to allow a student to retake a course for the purposes of 
                grade forgiveness.  Grade forgiveness policies for dual enrollment courses are included in the Dual 
                Enrollment  Articulation  Agreements  between  the  college  and  the  district.    If  the  articulation 
                agreement allows for grade forgiveness, all grades, including those forgiven, will remain on the 
                postsecondary transcript. 
                 
               ➢     Grade Forgiveness/Credit Recovery and AICE:  
                Due to the proprietary nature of the AICE curriculum, the district9s Grade Forgiveness Policy does 
                not apply to AICE coursework.  <Grade Forgiveness= and <Credit Recovery= are not available for 
                AICE coursework, whether using the district9s platform for credit recovery (Edgenuity) or the Credit 
                Recovery  courses  available  in  the  Florida  Department  of  Education9s  Course  Code  Directory. 
                Therefore, it is essential that the student, parent or guardian, and certified school counselor monitor 
                closely a student9s performance in AICE courses and make necessary decisions regarding schedule 
                changes in a timely manner, if warranted and supportive of the school9s schedule change policy.  
                This is especially critical when enrolling students into AICE courses that will serve as the required 
                credit to earn a high school standard diploma (i.e. English Language Arts).  The student9s option for 
                <retrieving= credit of a failed AICE course is to retake the course in its entirety. 
                 
                Scenario:  An 11th grade student is enrolled in AICE English General Paper to serve as the English III credit 
                towards a standard diploma.  The student earns a <D= or <F= in the course for either semester 1 and/or 
                semester 2.  It is unacceptable practice to enroll the student into English III, English III honors, AP Literature 
                or Language, or any other course in the Course Code Directory identified with an <EN= graduation subject 
                code, or any dual enrollment course, for the purpose of grade forgiveness or credit recovery as defined in s. 
                1003.4282(5), F.S. This is applicable to brick-and-mortar, Edgenuity, and virtual instructional platforms. 
                Important to note is that, per s. 1003.4282(5), F.S., any course grade not replaced according to a district 
                school board forgiveness policy shall be included in the calculation of the cumulative grade point average 
                required for graduation.

              •   Interim reports at the midterm for all students (i.e., at the 4 ½ week interval for regular schedule and 
                  at the 2-week interval for extended period) 
              •   Interim reports4daily, weekly, or an <as needed basis= for students performing below grade 
                  level 
              •   A standard report card issued to all students four (4) times a year, after each nine-week grading 
                  session, and on uniform dates as adopted annually 
              •   An annual report of student progress towards achieving state and district expectations for 
                  mastery of standards in English Language Arts, Mathematics, Social studies and Science based on 
                  results of district and statewide testing. Even if a student is 18 years of age or older, the parent 
                  will be notified when it is apparent that the student may fail or is doing unsatisfactory work in 
                  any course. The opportunity for a conference with the teacher, certified school counselor, and/or 
                  principal (or designee) will be provided 
              
             The results of statewide, standardized assessments in ELA and mathematics, science, and social studies, 
             including assessment retakes, shall be reported in an easy-to-read and understandable format and 
             delivered in time to provide useful, actionable information to students, parents, and each student9s current 
             teacher of record and teacher of record for the subsequent school year. 
              
             In accordance with F.S. 1008.22, the right of the parent to review statewide, standardized assessment 
             results is provided via the parent9s login to his/her account in FOCUS (student information system) 
             and/or the Individual Student Score Reports published and distributed to school districts by the Florida 
             Department of Education. Individual Score Report are four-page color reports. The report provides 
             general information about the statewide, standardized assessment program and the student9s assessment 
             results, including the student9s scale score, performance level, previous performance, and reporting 
             category scores. The report also indicates how the student9s performance compares to that of other 
             students who took the same test in the same school, district, and the state, and provides a list of helpful 
             resources. Parents may contact their child9s school principal for a copy of this report and for guidance on 
             how to login to FOCUS. Parents wishing to review school-wide and district-wide statewide, standardized 
             assessment results may also visit the <Know Your Schools= Data Portal. 
              
             Report Cards [F.S. 1003.33] 
             Report cards provide the student and the student9s parents or guardians with an objective evaluation of 
             scholastic achievement with indicators of progress.  All schools use the district approved report card as 
             the primary means of reporting student progress.  Report cards shall be issued at the end of each 
             grading period on uniform dates as adopted annually on the official school year calendar.  Students 
             transferring into the district after the midpoint of a reporting period may be assigned grades based on 
             records/grades from the sending school.

              Report cards will clearly depict and evaluate the following: 
                             o The student9s mastery of Florida Standards 
                             o The student9s attendance, including absences and tardies 
                             o The student9s conduct and behavior 
                             o Indication to parents when a student is working at a level below that expected for his/her 
                                assigned grade placement 
                             o Grades which reflect 
                                                      ▪    mastery of performance standards as outlined in the state course

                                                           Mathematics, Social Studies and Science as appropriate; and 
               
                       •       Annual report of student progress towards achieving state and district expectations 
                               for master of standards in English Language Arts, Mathematics, Social Studies and 
                               Science, based on results of district and state-wide testing; and  
                       •       For ESE and ELL students, the report will include progress towards achievement of 
                               all goals and objectives.   
                                
              Semester Grades 
              Semester grades are determined as follows: 
                                First nine weeks                   35% 
                                Second nine weeks                  35% 
                                Semester exam                      30% 
              The process is repeated for the second semester.   
                                                                    
              Semester Exams                                        
              High school students will be administered a teacher-made, midterm assessment at the end of semester one 
                                                                    
              and a teacher-made, final exam at the end of semester two in courses that do not have a state End-of-
                                                                    
              Course (EOC) Assessment.  Semester exams are based on subject performance standards.  
                
              Semester grades and credit of courses having a state standardized EOC assessment are not determined 
              until the results of the state standardized EOC assessment are received by the district.  Statewide, 
              standardized EOC assessments constitute 30% of the final course grade.  As such, teachers will not 
              administer <teacher-made= semester exams to students enrolled in a course resulting in a statewide, 
              standardized EOC assessment.  Instead, the semester 1 and semester 2 averages will include 30% of the 
              EOC assessment results.  Charlotte County Public Schools reports grades on a semester reporting system 
              only (terms one and two), therefore, the semester one and two averages must include 30% of the EOC 
              assessment results. For semester one and semester two report cards, an asterisk (*) will be placed with a 
              special note:  
              *Semester Exams & Semester Final Grades are pending end-of-year EOC assessment results. Please be advised:  Due 
              to various arrival dates of End-of-Course Assessment (EOC) results, CCPS will publish report cards in the FOCUS 
              Parent Portal each time EOC assessment scores are received.  At that time, the cumulative GPA will be updated and 
              final.  This will affect students that have taken EOC assessments for Algebra 1, Geometry, Biology, and U.S. 
              History.

              Senior End-of-Course Exam Waiver 
              NOTE: Official State of Florida End of Course (EOC) assessments cannot be waived. Only seniors 
              can waive exams; however, no one can waive statewide, standardized EOC assessments. 
              Exam waivers do not pertain to College Board Advanced Placement (AP) exams, AICE exams, and Dual 
              Credit exams required by colleges and taken while enrolled in dual enrollment courses, nor do they 
              pertain to official State of Florida EOC assessments. 
               
              The semester exam in a year-long course such as English or math, etc. can only be waived at the end of the 
              entire course.  A semester exam for a semester course can be waived at the end of first or second semester. 
              Students must have 
                  •     an overall <A= or <B= average in the course 
                  •     no more than 5 absences for the semester (3 in a block class) 
                  •     no more than five tardies for the semester 
                  •     no external suspensions for the entire semester 
                        
              The  waiver  must  be  signed  by  the  student9s  parent/guardian  and  submitted  for administrative 
              approval three (3) days prior to the semester exam date. When an exam is waived, the two nine-week 
              grades for that semester will be averaged to obtain a semester average for the course. 
               
              Grade Point Average and Interscholastic Activities [1006.15(2)(3)(a)] 
              In order for a student to be eligible to participate in athletic activities, an athlete must meet all of the 
              requirements established by the Florida High School Athletics Association and maintain satisfactory 
              conduct, as defined by the district Code of Student Conduct.  
               
              In order for a student to be eligible to participate in extra-curricular activities, the student must meet all of 
              the requirements established by the governing regulations of the organization and maintain satisfactory 
              conduct as defined by the district Code of Student Conduct.  For more information, please refer to the Student 
              Progression Plan ~ Introduction. 
               
              HIGH SCHOOL CREDIT  
              The Board recognizes that circumstances may permit students in grades 9-12 to meet course requirements 
              in less time than the state requirement of 135 clock hours (120 in an extended period or block class) of 
              instruction for the purpose of determining graduation credit. 
              The Board hereby delegates the responsibility to determine whether or not such circumstances exist to 
              the Superintendent, whose decision in such matters shall be final.  The Superintendent will inform the 
              Board of any such circumstances. 
              If, in the judgment of the Superintendent, circumstances exist that allow students to earn credit required 
              for graduation without meeting the state requirement of 135 clock hours for credit, students must 
              demonstrate mastery of established performance standards and applicable standards. 
              In such cases, each school department and/or grade level will identify and submit in writing to the 
              principal for approval a set of strategies that will be used to assess student mastery of the established 
              performance standards for each course in which the students are enrolled. 
              Furthermore, in such cases, it shall be the responsibility of the teacher of each course in which students 
              are enrolled to provide instruction in, and to assess mastery of all established performance standards. 
                                                                                                                                                
              STUDENT PROGRESSION PLAN – HIGH SCHOOL 2022-2023                                               THE DIVISION OF LEARNING  50 
               
              Progress towards mastery will be measured by teacher observation as well as the use of classroom 
              assignments and/or teacher-made or commercially developed tests. At the conclusion of the days 
              available for instruction, mastery of the established performance standards shall be measured by the use 
              of comprehensive departmental/grade level examinations or by culminating activities or projects.  Credit 
              will be earned by successful mastery of the established standards as described above. 
               
              Definition of High School Credit [F.S. 1003.436(2)] 
              One full credit is defined as a minimum of 135 hours (120 in the extended or block period) of instruction in 
              a designated course of study which contains student performance standards based on state standards. 
              •   The school district maintains a one-half credit earned system; full year courses will reflect two .5 credit 
                  awards.   
              •   A student enrolled in a full-year course shall receive one-half (.5) credit if the student successfully 
                  completes either the first half or the second half of a full-year course, but fails the other half of the 
                  course, and the averaging of the grades obtained in each half would not result in a passing grade.  
              •   A student enrolled in a full-year course shall receive a full (1.0) credit if the student successfully 
                  completes either the first half or the second half of a full-year course but fails to successfully complete 
                  the other half of the course, but the averaging of the grades obtained in each half would result in a 
                  passing grade, provided that such additional requirements specified in district school board policies, 
                  such as class attendance, homework, participation, and other indicators of performance, shall be 
                  successfully completed by the student.  
              •   Three (3) semester hours of college credit earned through dual enrollment and satisfying the 
                  requirements of the district9s articulation agreement shall also equal one-half (.5) high school credit 
                  unless otherwise designated by the Articulation Coordinating Committee or the Florida Department 
                  of Education. 
              •   The amount of in-class instruction time may be modified in dropout prevention program courses; 
                  however, the time must be sufficient to allow students to master course descriptions and district-
                  adopted performance standards. 
              •   A complete list of courses of study is available by accessing the Florida Course Code Directory. 
               
              Credit Acceleration Program [F.S. 1003.4295] 
              The Credit Acceleration Program (CAP) authorizes secondary students to earn high school credit in a 
              course that requires a statewide, standardized end-of-course (EOC) assessment if the student attains a 
              passing score on the EOC. These courses include Algebra I, Geometry, Biology and U.S. History. The 
              district shall award course credit to a student who is not enrolled in the course, or who has not completed 
              the course, if the student attains a score indicating satisfactory performance on the corresponding EOC. 
              High school students interested in this option must confer with their counselor. The requirements and 
              eligibility process are as follows:  
                       • The EOC will be administered only at the times established by the state assessment calendar.  
                       • The score necessary to earn credit will be determined by the state and applied in all situations.  
                       • Only credit (no grade) will be earned by meeting the passing score on the EOC.  
                        
              In addition, F.S. 1003.4295, Acceleration options, allows a student to earn high school credit in courses 
              required for high school graduation through passage of an Advanced Placement Examination or a College 
              Level Examination Program (CLEP). Notwithstanding s. 1003.436, a school district shall award course 
              credit to a student who is not enrolled in the course, or who has not completed the course, if the student 
              attains a passing score on the Advanced Placement Examination or CLEP. The school district shall permit 
                                                                                                                                                
              STUDENT PROGRESSION PLAN – HIGH SCHOOL 2022-2023                                               THE DIVISION OF LEARNING  51 
               
             a public school or home education student who is not enrolled in the course, or who has not completed 
             the course, to take the assessment or examination during the regular administration of the assessment or 
             examination.  Students wishing to utilize CAP through an Advanced Placement examination or CLEP are 
             highly encouraged to speak to their Certified School Counselor as implications to the timeliness of 
             awarding course credit upon the availability of certain Advanced Placement Examinations scores may 
             have impact on graduation status, GPA calculation, diploma awards and designations, etc.  
              
             Credit for High School Courses Taken Prior to Grade 9 [F.S. 1002.3105] 
             High school level courses taken prior to grade 9 may be used to satisfy high school graduation 
             requirements and Florida Bright Futures Award requirements. 
             Middle school students may earn credit toward high school graduation under the following conditions: 
                  •   Students are considered ninth graders during the periods in which they are enrolled in the 
                      high school credit courses offered at the middle school site 
                  •   The courses are listed in the Florida Course Code Directory and meet high school 
                      requirements 
                  •   The courses are offered for the same number of hours of instruction as currently offered at the 
                      high school 
                  •   Students demonstrate mastery of district course performance standards 
                  •   All grades earned must be placed on the high school transcript 
                  •   Students who earn a grade of <C,= <D,= or <F= will have the opportunity for grade 
                      forgiveness by retaking the same course or a comparable course in high school 
                  •   For a grade of <A= or <B,= the course and grade cannot be forgiven, will appear on the 
                      student9s high school transcript, and will be used in the calculation of the high school 
                      grade point average 
                  •   If the student retakes the course, only the higher grade and credit will be included in the grade 
                      point average calculation; however, the original grade will be shown on the transcript 
                       
             Performance Based Credit 
             Credit can be awarded for performance-based learning as well as for courses with approved modifications 
             as a strategy for dropout prevention at all of The Academy programs.

             High school students have an opportunity to achieve successful course completions after failing a course 
             through participation in virtual courses, the summer credit retrieval program (when offered) or through 
             the before, during, or after school credit retrieval program(s) throughout the school year (when offered). 
              
             Students earning credit via credit retrieval shall earn one of two grades it they successfully 
             complete their coursework: 
             A grade of <D,= if the level of work results in a percentage of 60-69 percent. 
             A grade of <C,= if the level of work results in a percentage of 70 percent or higher. 
              
             Second Chance Option 
             For courses provided on a full-year basis, if a student fails the first semester, a full-year credit can be 
             earned under the following conditions; 
                  •   The student earns a <C= or higher for each of the third and fourth quarters; and

                  •   The student earns a <C= or higher on the second semester exam 
                       
             Credit Restrictions 
             Level One Courses 
             No student may be granted credit toward high school graduation for enrollment in any Level 1 course 
             unless the student9s assessment indicates that a more rigorous course of study  would  be 
             inappropriate,  in  which  case  a  written  assessment  of  need  must  be included in the student9s IEP or 
             a student performance plan signed by the principal, the guidance counselor, and the parent/guardian. 
             Student assessment will include review of all academic records, standardized test scores, and teacher 
             evaluation. If these requirements are met, a Level 1 course may meet subject area graduation 
             requirements. A Limited English Proficient (LEP) student may be placed in a Level 1 course based 
             only on the student9s previous academic achievement or current needs, irrespective of English mastery 
             of standards.  Level 1 courses are listed in the Florida Course Code Directory. 
              
             Remedial Credits 
             Any grade 9-12 course listed in the Florida Course Code Directory for which credit is given may be used to 
             meet the elective credit requirement, except no more than nine (9) credits earned in remedial or 
             compensatory education may be counted as elective credit.  Remedial credits in mathematics or English 
             may be used only as elective credits, and may not be used as credits for required courses in mathematics 
             and English. 
              
             ASSESSMENTS, INSTRUCTIONAL SUPPORT, AND PROGRESS MONITORING [F.S. 1008.22, 
             1008.25] 
              
             The primary purpose of the student assessment program is to provide student academic achievement and 
             learning gains data to students, parents, teachers, school administrators, and school district staff. This data 
             is to be used by districts to improve instruction and by students, parents, and teachers to guide learning 
             objectives.  Participation in the statewide, standardized assessment program required under 1008.22 
             which includes the coordinated screening and progress monitoring system, the Florida9s Assessment of 
             Student Thinking (FAST) in ELA and Mathematics, State End-of-Course (EOC) assessments, the statewide, 
             standardized science assessments, and Florida Standards Alternate Assessments (FSAA) is mandatory for 
             all VPK-12 students attending public schools.  
              
             In order to meet the state mandated requirements for assessment and progress monitoring, students will 
             participate in the required state and district assessments used at the high school level to help determine 
             student achievement. Each student must participate in statewide, standardized assessments unless 
             exempt under certain criteria established by the Commissioner of Education. For Exceptional Student 
             Education (ESE), English Language Learners (ELL) students, and students who have a 504 plan, any 
             accommodations must be specified in their individual education plans.  Each plan must state specifically 
             which tests the student is expected to take and the accommodations(s) allowed for that test. Other 
             formative assessments may also be used to help determine student progress towards achievement. 
             Required state and district assessments will be administered in accordance with the district9s Uniform 
             Statewide Assessment Calendar

                Required State and District Assessments in High School 
                In all high school courses that do not have a state End-of-Course (EOC) assessment, high school students 
                will take a district/teacher made midterm exam, and it will be 30% of the semester one grade.  They will 
                also take a district/teacher made final exam, and it will be 30% of the semester two grade.  State EOC 
                assessments are weighted 30%. The 30% weight of the State EOC assessment does not apply to students 
                enrolled in Advanced Placement US History or Dual Enrollment American History participating in the 
                State EOC assessment for the purpose of a Scholar9s Designation on the Standard Diploma. 
                 
                Florida Civics Literacy Exam (FCLE) 
                The 2021 Florida Legislature passed, and signed into law, Senate Bill 1108 which creates a process to allow 
                students in high school to earn the civic literacy requirement before enrolling in a public college or 
                university in the state.  Beginning with the 2021-2022 school year, students taking United States 
                Government will be required to take the assessment of civic literacy.  Students who earn a passing score 
                on the civic literacy assessment in the high school course will be exempt from the post-secondary civic 
                literacy assessment.  Please note the following: 
                 
                     •     All students enrolled in US Government must take the test; however, the test is not required to 
                           earn a diploma, and it will not count 30% of the US Government grade. Florida Statute 
                           1003.4282(3)(d) will require students completing the United States Government course to take the 
                           test. 
                     •     The assessment will be delivered via the Cambium platform (same platform used for FSA) 
                     •     Accommodated versions of the test, as well as braille and large print, will be provided. 
                     •     The test will be deployed twice in the school year for use by students enrolled in semester 1 
                           government courses and again for semester 2 government courses  
                     •     The requirement to sit for the test is based upon course enrollment, not grade level (in other words, 
                           it is not a <12th grade test.= It is a test that all students enrolled in US Government are required to 
                           take, regardless of the students9 grade level. 
                     •     Test results are not to be used in the calculation of the student9s final course grade. 
                     •     Since a passing score exempts students from the postsecondary civics requirement, FDOE will 
                           have test score data transmitted on survey 5 so that it can be included on students' transcripts.  
                     •     On April 1, 2022, the Department posted the FCLE Supplemental Guide and FCLE Sample Items. 
                     •     The purpose of these sample test materials is to orient faculty and students to the nature of the test 
                           content and test questions on the FCLE. 
                     •     The content included in the Supplemental Guide is not intended to replace associated coursework 
                           or other preparation methods required to demonstrate civic literacy, as described in Florida 
                           Statute. 
                     •     The sample questions and answers are not intended to demonstrate the length of the actual test. 
                     •     Student performance on the sample test should not be used as a predictor of performance on the 
                           actual test.

             Concordant & Comparative Score Options [SBE Rule 6A-1.09422] 
             Concordant and Comparative Scores4A student can also meet assessment graduation requirements by 
             earning a concordant or comparative score as specified in Rule 6A-1.09422, Florida Administrative Code 
             (F.A.C.). Tables 3 and 4 below show the concordant and comparative scores students may use to satisfy 
             assessment graduation requirements. 
              
             In accordance with section (s.) 1008.22, Florida Statutes (F.S.), all students enrolled in grade 10 are 
             required to participate in the grade 10 ELA assessment and all students enrolled in Algebra 1 or an 
             equivalent course are required to participate in the Algebra 1 EOC assessment, regardless of whether they 
             have a passing concordant or comparative score on file. 
              
             Passing concordant or comparative scores on these alternative assessments are valid even if the student 
             has not yet taken the respective statewide assessment.

                 1.  Administered in March 2016 or beyond. The combined score for the EBRW must come from    the 
                      same administration of the Reading and Writing subtests.  
                 2.  The average of the English and Reading subtests. If the average of the two subject test scores 
                      results in a decimal (.5), the score shall be rounded up to the next whole number. The scores for the

                  concordant and comparative scores aligned to the FSA by one year. Therefore, scores that were 
                  previously only available to students Revised February 2022 3 who entered grade 9 prior to 2018319 
                  are now available to students who entered grade 9 prior to 2019320. 
              
             The Next Generation Sunshine State Standards (NGSSS) Algebra 1 Retake End-of-Course (EOC) 
             Assessment was administered for the final time during the summer 2017 administration, and the FCAT 2.0 
             Reading Retake was administered for the final time during the spring 2018 administration.  Students for 
             whom these tests were their graduation requirement can meet that requirement by using either the prior 
             or current concordant and comparative scores. 
              
             When a student or adult earns a passing concordant or comparative score to meet graduation 
             requirement(s), it shall be recorded in their cumulative record. Regardless of whether they have already 
             been awarded a certificate of completion, a student or adult who has met all other high school graduation

           FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS 
            
               1.  Can students still use a PERT comparative score to meet the Algebra 1 assessment graduation   
               requirement?  
                    
                   No.  Students entering the 2021-2022 school year as SENIORS were the last cohort of students that 
                   could use PERT to satisfy the Algebra 1 assessment requirement. Students who enrolled in grade 
                   9 prior to the 2018-19 school year will continue to be eligible to earn a passing comparative score 
                   of 97 on the PERT assessment to meet the graduation requirement for the Algebra 1 EOC 
                   assessment. Students enrolled in grade 9 in the 2019-2020 school year and beyond will not be 
                   eligible to use PERT to satisfy the Algebra 1 assessment graduation requirement. 
            
               2.  Can a student who will enter grade 9 in 2019-2020 and beyond use a concordant or comparative 
                   score earned prior to the adoption of this rule if the score or assessment is not one listed in the 
                   amended rule (e.g., a current 8th grader earned a 97 on PERT in the 2017-18 school year)? 
                     
                   No. Students who will enter grade 9 in 2019-2020 and beyond are not eligible to use concordant or 
                   comparative scores earned prior to the implementation of the revised rule. 
            
               3.  How does the amendment to the Rule presented to the State Board of Education in July 2020 add 
                   an additional pathway and extend the opportunities of earning a comparative score to meet the 
                   Algebra 1 EOC assessment requirement? 
                    
                   An additional pathway to meet the Algebra 1 EOC assessment graduation requirement provided 
                   students enrolled in a course aligned with the Algebra 1 EOC assessment during the 2019-2020 
                   school year the option of meeting the requirement by achieving a passing score on the Geometry 
                   EOC assessment.  This additional pathway is extended to all students who entered grade 9 in the 
                   2011-2012 school year and beyond.  This change is retroactive for any student in one of these 
                   cohorts who has not yet met the Algebra 1 assessment graduation requirement but who has a 
                   passing Geometry EOC score on file.   
                    
               4.  Can a student CAP both Algebra 1 and Geometry by passing the Geometry EOC? 
                    
                   No.  Because section 1003.4295 Florida Statutes specifies that credit under CAP is limited to 
                   passage of a corresponding EOC, the statute anticipates that credit will be given upon passage of 
                   an EOC that to some degree covers the content of the course.  Therefore, the fact that a passing 
                   score on the Geometry EOC assessment will be used to meet the Algebra 1 EOC assessment 
                   graduation requirement does not mean that it is a corresponding EOC for CAP credit. 
                                                     
               5.  Will PERT still be used for dual enrollment or other placement decisions?  
                    
                                                                                                                     
           STUDENT PROGRESSION PLAN – HIGH SCHOOL 2022-2023                             THE DIVISION OF LEARNING  58 
            
                   Dual enrollment assessment requirements are defined in the articulation agreements between the 
                   district and the post-secondary college or university. 
            
               6.  Can students still use an SAT Reading subscore to satisfy the requirement?  
                               
                   Students who entered grade 9 prior to the 2018-19 school year will continue to be eligible to use the 
                   SAT Reading test subscore of 24. Students who enter grade 9 in 2019-2020 and beyond will not be 
                   eligible to use SAT Reading subscore. 
            
               7.  Are there ways to help students pay for SAT or ACT tests?  
                    
                   Yes.  Both the College Board and ACT offer fee waivers for eligible students participating in the 
                   SAT and ACT, respectively. For more information on SAT eligibility, please visit  
                   https://collegereadiness.collegeboard.org/sat/register/fees/fee-waivers. For more information 
                   on ACT eligibility, please visit

               8.  Can students use the average of ACT English and ACT Reading scores from different test 
                   administrations?  
                    
                   Yes.  The new concordant passing scale score for the average of the English and Reading subject 
                   test scores on the ACT shall be a score equal to or greater than eighteen (18) on the 1 to 36 scale. 
                   For the ACT, if the average of the two subject test scores results in a decimal of .5, the score shall 
                   be rounded up to the next whole number. The scores for the English and Reading subject tests on 
                   the ACT are not required to come from the same test administration.  For any student who has 
                   taken ACT more than once, the student9s highest ACT English score from any administration may 
                   be combined with the student9s highest ACT Reading score from any administration to determine 
                   an average of the two scores.  
                    
               9.  Can students use SAT or ACT concordant or comparative scores that are deemed <non-college-
                   reportable= by College Board or ACT?  
                    
                   Yes.  Statute and Rule do not offer any distinction between <college-reportable= or <non-college-
                   reportable= scores for either the SAT or ACT. Any valid passing score reported by ACT or College 
                   Board may be used for the purpose of satisfying Florida9s assessment graduation requirements. 
            
           Achievement Levels for Comprehensive Statewide Assessments [F.S. 1008.22 & SBE Rule 6A-1.09422] 
           Section 1008.22, Florida Statutes, requires that the State Board of Education (SBE) specify, by rule, the scale 
           score ranges and achievement levels for each statewide, standardized assessment.  In addition, F.S. 
           1008.22(3)(e)2 requires that the SBE designate passing scores, by rule, for each statewide, standardized 
           assessment, which has been the minimum score in achievement level 3 for all statewide assessments since 
           the requirement was first implemented in rule in 2013.  The Florida Standards in Mathematics and English 
           Language Arts were approved by the Florida State Board of Education in February 2014 and were 
           implemented in grades K312 in the 201432015 school year. All Florida schools teach the State Assessment 
           Standards, and all students are assessed through the statewide, standardized assessment program.

        Florida Standards Alternate Assessment. 
        The Florida Standards Alternate Assessment (FSAA) is designed for students with the most significant 
        cognitive disabilities and whose participation in the general statewide assessment is not appropriate, even 
        with accommodations, assistive technology or accessible instructional materials. The Florida Standards 
        Alternate Assessment measures student academic performance on the Access Points (FS-AP) in English 
        Language Arts, mathematics, science and social studies.  Like the alternative assessment, Access Points 
        reflect the essence or core intent of the standards that apply to all students in the same grade with reduced 
        levels of complexity. Access Points are academic expectations written specifically for students with the 
        most significant cognitive disabilities. IEP Teams are responsible for determining whether students with 
        disabilities will be assessed with the FAST or with the FSAA based on criteria outlined in Rule 6A-
        1.0943(4), Florida Administrative Code (F.A.C.)

        PSAT/NMSQT for all 10  Graders [F.S. 1007.35(5)] 
        In accordance with Florida Statutes, each high school, including alternative sites, shall provide for the 
        administration of the PreACT or PSAT/NMSQT to all enrolled grade 10 students.  However, a written 
        notice shall be provided to each parent that includes the opportunity to exempt his or her child from

              PSAT/NMSQT for districtwide administration.  Test results will provide each high school with a database 
              of student assessment data that certified school counselors will use to identify students who are prepared 
              or will need additional work to be prepared to enroll and be successful in AP courses or other advanced 
              high school courses.

              SAT/ACT for all 11  Graders [F.S. 1008.22] 
              The 2021 Florida Legislature passed, and was signed into law, Senate Bill 1108 which incorporates 
              nationally recognized high school assessments into F.S.1008.22 and requires each school district, by the 
              2022-2023 school year and subject to appropriation, select either the SAT or ACT for district-wide 
              administration to each public school student in grade 11, including students attending public high 
              schools, charter schools, alternative schools, and DJJ education programs.  Please note the following: 
                  •    The district must choose between the SAT or the ACT; all schools must administer the same 
                       assessment. 
                  •    Participation in the assessment is determined by the enrolled grade of the student.  Only 11th grade 
                       students may participate, and ACT/SAT will not make a distinction between first time 11th graders 
                       and students that are repeating the 11th grade. 
                  •    The test is college-reportable. 
                        
              Assessment Opportunities for Home Education Students 
              Opportunities to take state assessment tests are available to home education students.  
               
              Assessment of Virtual Students 
              Students enrolled in a CVS/FLVS course that requires a state End-of-Course assessment (EOC) are 
              required to take the EOC in their home zoned school. 
               
              No Assessment Exemptions Based on Attendance [F.S. 1003.33 (2)]  
              Schools shall not exempt students from academic performance requirements, such as final exams, based 
              on practices or policies designed to encourage student attendance.  
               
              Algebra I, Geometry, Biology, & US History EOC Assessment & High School Credit Scenarios: 
              Because passing the Algebra 1 EOC is a graduation requirement, it is important to understand the possible 
              scenarios for a high school Algebra 1 student. Each student and parent/guardian should be aware of the 
              following possible scenarios upon enrollment in an Algebra 1 course. 
               
              *The following scenarios are also applicable to students enrolled in a Geometry, Biology, and/or a US 
              History course that elicits high school credit.  Exceptions are noted in the chart below:

              State Assessments for Transfer Students [State Rule 6A-1.09941, F.A.C] 
              If a student transfers into a Florida high school from out of country, out of state, a private school, or a 
              home school, and the student9s transcript shows credit received in Algebra I or an equivalent course, the 
              student must pass the statewide, standardized Algebra I EOC assessment in order to earn a standard high 
              school diploma, unless the student earned a comparative score or passed a statewide assessment in algebra I 
              administered by the transferring entity.  If a student9s transcript shows a credit in high school reading or 
              English Language Arts II or III, in order to earn a standard high school diploma, the student must take and 
              pass the grade 10 ELA assessment, or earn a concordant score.  
               
              If a transfer student9s transcript shows a final course grade and course credit in Algebra I, Geometry, 
              Biology I or U.S. History, the transferring course final grade and credit shall be honored without the 
              student taking the requisite statewide, standardized EOC assessment and without the assessment results 
              constituting 30 percent of the student9s final course grade. However, transfer students must pass Florida9s 
              EOC assessments in order to be eligible for the scholar designation.

                          teacher endorsed or certified in reading 
                 
                High schools will utilize the Assessment/Curriculum Decision Trees of the District9s K-12 Comprehensive 
                Evidence-Based Reading Plan to demonstrate how data will be used to determine specific reading 
                instructional needs and interventions for all students, when a student is identified to receive intensive 
                reading intervention, what intensive reading interventions will be used, how the intensive reading 
                interventions are provided and assurance that intensive reading interventions are delivered by a teacher 
                who is certified or endorsed in reading. 
                 
                High schools will provide and modify instruction for students who have not responded to a specific level 
                of reading intervention with the initial intensity (time and group size) provided.  
                           
                High Schools will provide targeted instructional support for students identified as having a reading 
                deficiency or who are reading below grade level as determined by the statewide, standardized English 
                Language Arts assessment.  In accordance with Section 1008.25(4)(c), F.S., students identified with a 
                substantial reading deficiency as determined in Section 1008.25(5)(a), F.S., must be covered by a federally 
                required student plan, such as an individual educational plan (IEP) or an individualized progress

              interventions are delivered by a teacher who is certified or endorsed in reading. 
               
              High schools will utilize a core curriculum and intervention materials that address the six (6) components 
              of reading: oral language, phonological awareness, phonics, fluency, vocabulary, and comprehension. 
               
              High schools will develop methods to provide reading instruction and intervention to students who 
              receive instruction through distance or blended learning in situations of Instructional Continuity Plan 
              facilitation. 
               
              High schools will utilize the four (4) types of classroom assessments:  screening, progress monitoring/ 
              diagnostic, and summative assessment 
               
              High schools will ensure the following: 
                           •    Core instruction (Tier 1): is standards-aligned; includes accommodations for students with 
                       a disability, students with an Individual Educational Plan (IEP), and students who are English 
                       language learners; provides print-rich explicit and systematic, scaffolded, and differentiated 
                       instruction and corrective feedback; builds background and content knowledge; incorporates 
                       writing in response to reading; and incorporates the principles of Universal Design for Learning

                       via one-on-one or very small group instruction with more guided practice, immediate corrective 
                       feedback, and frequent progress monitoring; and occurs in addition to core instruction and Tier 2 
                       interventions. In accordance with Section 1011.62(8)(d), F.S., intensive reading interventions must 
                       be delivered by instructional personnel who are certified or endorsed in reading. 
                           •    Data from the results of formative assessments will guide differentiation of instruction and 
                       intervention in the classroom. 
                        
              For each year in which a student scores at Level 1 or 2 on the Florida Assessment of Student Thinking 
              (FAST) in English Language Arts (ELA), the student may be enrolled in an Intensive Reading course the 
              following year.

              Targeted Instructional Support - Mathematics [F.S.1008.25] 
              High Schools will provide targeted instructional support for students with identified deficiencies in 
              Mathematics.  For each year in which a student scores at Level 1 or Level 2 on a statewide, standardized 
              assessment for mathematics, the student may receive support the following year.  Support may be 
              provided within the student9s regularly scheduled math class or through the Foundational Skills in 
              Mathematics 9-12 course. The school-wide plan must contain the following elements: 
                                   •   Additional diagnostic assessment; 
                                   •   Identification of the specific diagnosed academic needs to be remediated; 
                                   •   Identification of the success-based and/or research-based strategies to be used; 
                                   •   Identification of how, when, how often, by whom and how long intensive 
                                       remedial instruction is to be provided; and 
                                   •   Identification of monitoring and re-evaluation activities to be employed. 
              Students will be re-assessed at the end of the remediation period to determine if grade-level 
              achievement in the B.E.S.T. Mathematics standards has been attained.  Remediation must consider a 
              student9s learning style. 
               
              All high school students must participate in school-wide, district-required progress monitoring 
              testing for mathematics as described in the District9s 2022-2023 Uniform Statewide Assessment Calendar. 
               
              *Note:  Remedial instruction is not in lieu of mathematics course completion requirements for promotion.  
               
              Multi-Tiered System of Supports (MTSS) 
              Each student who does not meet specific levels of performance in English Language Arts, Science, 
              Social studies and/or Mathematics shall be provided with scientifically research-based interventions 
              as indicated by additional diagnostic assessments used to determine the nature of the student9s 
              difficulty and areas of academic need.  Supportive instruction shall continue until performance 
              expectations are met as documented by demonstrating mastery, passing the state assessment(s) or 
              graduating from high school. 
               
              Progress monitoring plans (PMP) shall be developed in consultation with the parent or guardian for any 
              student not meeting district or state achievement levels in English Language Arts, Science, Social 
              Studies, or Math. The plan can be an IEP or a school-wide system of progress monitoring for all 
              students through the Multi-tiered System of Supports (MTSS). The multi-tiered system of academic 
              and behavioral supports relies on problem solving and data-based decision-making to improve 
              educational outcomes and meet the academic and behavioral needs of all students. Multiple tiers of 
              increasingly  intense  instruction or intervention  services  are  implemented  and monitored. 
               
              The school-wide Progress Monitoring Plan must include intensive remedial instruction in the areas of

                  weakness. Intensive remediation means instruction designed to specifically concentrate time and effort 
                  on the diagnosed deficiencies of the individual student.  If a student is being served in ESE, ELL, or 
                  Intensive  Literacy  programs,  the  plan  developed  for  these  programs  can  serve  as  the  Progress 
                  Monitoring Plan if the Plan addresses the specific area(s) of need identified for English Language Arts, 
                  Science, Social studies and/or Mathematics. 
                   
                   High School Early Warning System Indicators 
                  A school that serves any students in kindergarten through grade 8 shall implement an Early Warning 
                  System to identify students in such grades who need additional support to improve academic 
                  performance and stay engaged in school.  Charlotte County Public Schools has developed an Early 
                  Warning System (EWS) at all grade levels in accordance with the requirements of Florida statute and after 
                  review of the research on the benefits of employing an EWS. Utilizing data systematically to identify at-
                  risk students as early as possible will allow for the application of more effective prevention and early

        test administration limit may be exceeded as needed to provide test accommodations that are required by 
        an Individual Education Plan, 504 Plan or English Language Learner Plan.  
         
        In order to meet the state mandated requirements for assessment and progress monitoring, state and 
        district-required assessments are used at the secondary level to help determine student achievement.  Other 
        formative assessments may also be used to help determine student progress and achievement.    
         
        Each student who does not achieve a level 3 or above on the English Language Arts assessment or the 
        Algebra 1 EOC assessment must be evaluated to determine the nature of the student9s difficulty, the 
        areas of academic need, and strategies for providing academic supports to improve the student9s 
        performance. School personnel shall use all available resources to achieve parent understanding of, and 
        cooperation with, the progress monitoring requirements.  A student who is not meeting the school 
        district or state requirements for satisfactory performance in English Language Arts and mathematics 
        must be covered by one of the following plans: 
             •    a federally required student plan such as an individual education plan (IEP),  
             •    a school-wide system of progress monitoring for all students except a student who scores 
                  level 4 or above on the English Language Arts and mathematics assessments may be 
                  exempted from participation by the principal; or  
             •    individualized progress monitoring.  
              
        A student who has a substantial reading deficiency must be covered by a federally required student plan, 
        such as an individual education plan or an individualized progress monitoring plan, or both, as necessary. 
        All progress monitoring shall be tailored to identify the individual assistance deemed necessary to remedy 
        a student's diagnosed deficiencies. The progress monitoring must clearly identify:  
             •    the specific diagnosed academic need(s) to be remediated,  
             •    the success-based intervention strategies to be used,  
             •    how, when, how often, by whom and how long intensive remedial instruction is to be 
                  provided, and  
             •    the monitoring and reevaluation activities to be employed. 
         
        GRADUATION:  DIPLOMAS and PATHWAYS:  REQUIREMENTS, OPTIONS, and 
        GUIDELINES [F.S. 1003.4282] 
         
        Graduation Requirements 
        According to Florida law, students must meet all academic requirements to earn a standard high school 
        diploma from a public school. This means that students must pass required courses, earn a minimum 
        number of credits, earn a minimum grade point average, and pass the required statewide assessments.  
        Students who pass required courses and earn the minimum number of credits required, but do not pass 
        the required assessments (or earn a concordant and/or comparative score) and/or do not achieve a 
        cumulative grade point average of 2.0 on a 4.0 scale will receive a certificate of completion, which is not 
        equivalent to a standard high school diploma. Passing scores for the statewide assessments are 
        determined by the State Board of Education.

               (e) By October 1st of each year, districts must report to the Department of Education the formative 
           assessments they are using for this purpose and the score or metric that is used on the assessment to 
           demonstrate that grade-level expectations have been met.

              Beginning with the graduating class of 2022-2023, HB 461 (2022 Legislative Session) set into law that 
              students may complete 100 hours of paid work to satisfy the volunteer service hour requirement for any 
              Bright Futures award. 
               
              Note:  The eligibility requirements vary for each scholarship. Requirements include, but are not limited 
              to, certain course requirements and minimum grade point average. Detailed information about these

              Talented 20 Program 
              At the end of the seventh semester, the school district provides the Department of Education a list of the top 
              twenty percent (20%) of the senior class seeking a Standard Diploma based on their weighted grade point 
              averages as defined by the Charlotte County School District.  Students within this top twenty percent who 
              have met the State University System required courses for admission are guaranteed admission by the State of 
              Florida into one of the public universities. If more than 20% of the senior class falls into the top 20% due to 
              ties in weighted grade point average, the following will be considered in the order listed: 
                       •  State University System 3 19 required credits; 
                       •  Number of level 3 courses; and 
                       •  Length of time at school.

              additional year and receive instruction to remedy the deficiencies.  If the student does not elect to enroll in 
              high school, the student may enroll in an Adult Education Program for remediation and participate in the 
              assessments to meet graduation requirements.  The adult student may also earn the concordant or 
              comparative score to meet graduation requirements.  There is no time limit by which the district will 
              accept a concordant or comparative score in order to issue a standard diploma to the adult student.  A 
              student who has received a standard Certificate of Completion, who subsequently meets the requirements 
              for a standard diploma, shall be awarded a standard diploma whenever the requirements are completed.

                                                  in s. 1003.572. 
                
               Assessment Waivers for Students with Disabilities [F.S. 1008.22(3)(c)2] 
               All students, including Exceptional Student Education (ESE) students, must participate in the state9s 
               assessment and accountability system.  ESE shall participate in the same state and district assessments 
               including the Florida9s Assessment of Student Thinking (FAST) or Florida Standards Alternate 
               Assessment (FSAA), and End of Course (EOC) exams or Access End of Course (Access EOC) exams.  If 
               ESE students receive testing accommodations, the accommodations must be listed in the student9s 
               Individual Education Plan (IEP) and utilized regularly during classroom instruction and assessment. 
               Allowed accommodations are listed in the procedures9 manual for each specific assessment. 
                
               Legislation, however, provides for a waiver of statewide, standardized assessment graduation 
               requirements for students with disabilities whose abilities cannot be accurately measured by the 
               assessments. Pursuant to s. 1008.22(3)(c)2., F.S., <A student with a disability, as defined in s. 1007.02(2), for 
               whom the individual education plan (IEP) team determines that the statewide, standardized assessments 
               under this section cannot accurately measure the student9s abilities, taking into consideration all allowable 
                                                                                                                                                              
               STUDENT PROGRESSION PLAN – HIGH SCHOOL 2022-2023                                                         THE DIVISION OF LEARNING  79 
                
           accommodations, shall have assessment results waived for the purpose of receiving a course grade and a 
           standard high school diploma. Such waiver shall be designated on the student9s transcript.=  For 
           additional information, students and parents are encouraged to contact the Certified School Counselor 
           and/or ESE Liaison at the school site. 
            
           Special Exemptions 
           A student with a disability may be allowed a special exemption from participating in FAST or FSAA due 
           to extraordinary circumstances that affect the student9s ability to physically show mastery of the skills that 
           have been acquired for a statewide assessment. A student with a disability may also be considered for a 
           medical exemption from statewide assessments, providing the IEP team determines that the student 
           should not be assessed based on medical documentation that confirms that the student meets the criteria 
           of medical complexity. 
            
           All decisions regarding special exemptions from statewide assessments will be made by the student9s IEP 
           team, of which the parent is a part.  A specific process and timeline must be followed as outlined in Rule 
           6A-1.0943(5) F.A.C. 
            
           SWD Deferring Receipt of a Standard High School Diploma [FS1003.4282(11)] 
           A student9s Individual Educational Plan which requires special education transition planning, transition 
           services, or related services beyond graduation through the age of 21 may defer receipt of their standard 
           diploma. Prior to deferring receipt of the diploma, the student must be enrolled in accelerated college 
           credit instruction, industry certification courses that lead to college credit, a collegiate high school 
           program that leads to Career and Professional Education Industry Certification, courses necessary to 
           satisfy the Scholar designation requirements, or a structured work-study, internship or pre-apprenticeship 
           program in order to continue to receive a Free and Appropriate Public Education.  For the IEP in effect at 
           the beginning of the school year that the student is expected to graduate, there must be a signed statement 
           from the parent, guardian, or the student, if the student has reached the age of majority and rights have 
           transferred to the student, that he/she understands the process for deferment and identifying if the 
           student will defer the receipt of his/her standard high school diploma. The deferral applies until the 
           student is no longer age eligible for FAPE or elects to accept the standard diploma, whichever comes first.  
           A student choosing to defer the acceptance of his or her diploma will be eligible to participate in the 
           graduation ceremony.  Once the deferment period has ended, the student will receive his or her diploma.
