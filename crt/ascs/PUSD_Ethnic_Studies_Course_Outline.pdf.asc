       Overview 
       This Ethnic Studies course is designed to develop an understanding of how race, 
       ethnicity,  nationality,  and  culture  have  shaped  and  continue  to  shape 
       individuals and society in the United States. It is designed to provide students 
       with the knowledge to achieve an understanding of and an appreciation for the 
       various cultures in their community and the nation. This course aims to educate 
       students  to  be  politically,  socially  and  economically  conscious  about  their 
       personal connections to local and global histories. By studying the histories of 
       race, ethnicity, nationality, and culture, including the legacy of social movements 
       and  mass  struggles  against  injustice,  students  will  cultivate  respect  and 
       empathy for individuals and solidarity with groups of people locally, nationally 
       and globally to foster active social engagement and community building.  
        
       Course Content 
       Unit 1: Introduction to Ethnic Studies and Identity 
       In this introductory unit, students explore both the history of the Ethnic Studies 
       movement and the influences that have shaped and continue to shape students’ 
       own identities.  Students learn the origins of Ethnic Studies as an academic 
       discipline in California in 1969 as well as about current efforts to ban Ethnic 
       Studies courses in Arizona schools.  Students analyze scholarly literature on the 
       origins, historical, and contemporary meanings of identities/names of African 
       Americans,  Asian  Americans,  Chicana/o/x  and  Latina/o/x  Americans,  and 
       Native Americans that have been assigned or forced upon them by dominant 
       society (external forces) as well as the identities/names that these respective 
       communities have self-determined and embraced (internal forces).  Students will 
       explore answers to the essential question: What is Ethnic Studies and how might 
       our participation in the course positively influence our intellectual development, 
       the improvement of our school culture and increase our community pride? 
        
       As students learn about the history and impact of Ethnic Studies, they also begin 
       exploring their own identities in this unit.  Students investigate the myriad 
       influences that impact their identities and perceptions of themselves, including 
       bias,  stereotyping,  gender,  sexuality,  geography,  race,  class,  language,  and 
       immigrant  status.  To  better  understand  these  influences,  students  are 
       introduced to frameworks and theories such as Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs and 
       Critical Race Theory.  They begin to study the concepts of systemic racism and 
       institutional, interpersonal and internalized oppression in order to apply them 
       to future units of study.  Students continuously ask the essential questions: How 
       do we define our various intersectional identities: global, national, state, local 
       and community? What has shaped and continues to shape who I am? 
        
       Key Assignments 
        1.  Students  will  begin  journals  that  continue  throughout  the  year-long 
          course, used for reflecting on their own identities as well as their newfound 
          understandings of others. 
        2.  Using <I am Esperanza= by Sandra Cisneros as a model, students will write 
          an autobiographical <I am= poem in which they reflect on how intersections 
          of race, ethnicity, nationality, and culture have shaped their identities. 
          Students will have choice in the way they choose to publish their poem 
          (autobiography,  visual  essay,  mural,  performance  art)  as  a  way  of 
          answering the essential question: What has shaped and continues to 
          shape who I am? 
        3.  Students select and analyze examples of contemporary stereotyping in 
          popular  culture  (advertisements,  music,  television  programs,  films)  to 
          understand how stereotypes are reproduced and perpetuated. Based on 
          these investigations, students produce public service announcements for 
          distribution in their schools that challenge particular stereotypes in terms 
          of institutional, interpersonal and internalized oppression. 
        4.  Students will first draw their own maps of the Los Angeles area based on 
          their  perception  of  where  they  believe  different  ethnicities  and  socio-
          economic classes live. They will then compare these maps with maps 
          derived from 2010 census data. They will write a 1-page reflection on the 
          similarities and differences between their perceptions of geography and the 
          realities based on data, linking this back to how geography shapes ethnic 
          and cultural identity. 
        5.  As a culminating activity to end the unit, students will participate in a 
          Socratic  Seminar  that  focuses  on  the  impact  of  Ethnic  Studies  on 
          individuals and communities, the impact of stereotyping, the difference 
          between race and ethnicity, race as a social construct and the impact of 
          social media on identity.  Students will have the opportunity to create their 
          own questions as well as discuss questions posed by the teacher. 
        
       Unit 2: History of Immigration and Movement in the US 
       In the second unit, students address the essential question: How did we get here? 
       By analyzing the history of the US, California, Los Angeles, and Paramount and 
       its surrounding cities, students gain an understanding of immigration policies 
       throughout US history, identifying the push and pull factors of voluntary, forced, 
       and refugee migration including the role of war, natural resources, and ideology 
       in movement. Students look at the cultural, social and economic implications of 
       immigration, including how waves of immigrants have been treated differently 
       and how immigration policies and legal status influences the perceptions that 
       people hold of immigrants and their rights. Students identify and analyze the 
       historical and current contributions that immigrants make politically, culturally, 
       socially and economically in the US and how various immigrant experiences 
       contribute to ethnic identity.  Students also examine and analyze the processes 
       of acculturation and assimilation, weighing both their potential positive and 
       negative effects. 
        
       Key Assignments 
        1.  Students will continue their journals, using them to reflect on the impact 
          of immigration and movement on culture, society, economics, and politics 
          as well as the contributions made by various ethnic groups.  
        2.  Students will research their own family history or that of another culture, 
          including their history before the US, where entrance to the US occurred; 
          the reasons behind immigration (push/pull factors); initial experiences 
          related to settlement, economic issues and assimilation; how immigration 
          policy affected the family/culture; migration patterns through the US over 
          time; and how the culture has contributed to the overall American cultural 
          experience today.  Students will give a final multimedia presentation to 
          share their research with their class.  After the presentations, students 
          will  reflect  on  what  they  learned  about other cultures or the differing 
          experiences of immigrants from the same culture. 
        3.  Students will interview an immigrant or migrant and address a specific 
          issue to the ethnicity of the person being interviewed (i.e., immigration 
          experience or experiences as a member of their ethnicity in school, etc.). 
          The interview should be audio recorded and transcribed. Students must 
          get a signed consent form to conduct the interview and will have the choice 
          to  create  a  PowerPoint,  short  film,  visual  presentation,  design  an 
          illustrated comic book or write an essay as a final product. The final 
          product can then be presented to the class and/or shared with the school. 
         
       Unit 3: Power and Oppression 
       In this unit, students answer the essential question: To what extent do internal 
       and external social, political and interpersonal structural controls shape the 
       inequalities  found  in  American  society?  Students  focus  on  comparing  how 
       institutions, such as public education, the legal system, immigration system, 
       health care system, housing system, labor system, prison/detention institutions 
       and economic system have functioned over time to impact groups’ oppression, 
       identity  and  resistance.  Students  analyze  institutional,  interpersonal  and 
       internalized  oppression  as  well  as  media  stereotypes  and  the  rights  of  the 
       governed and oppressed. Students connect the learning from this unit to their 
       own community and reflect on ways that structural controls, institutions and 
       resistance have influenced their lives. To close out the unit and bridge to the 
       next unit, students use critical thinking skills to begin to identify and evaluate 
       the  forms  of  resistance  that  specific  groups  use(d)  to  counter  oppressive 
       structural controls and institutions. 
        
        
        
        
       Key Assignments 
        1.  Students  will  continue  their  journals,  using  them  to  reflect  on  how 
          institutions, media and stereotypes play a part in the oppression of groups 
          of people.  
        2.  Students  will  create  a  dominant  narrative  reference  guide  for  how  to 
          evaluate the various narratives they encounter in their lives. Students 
          should use this assignment to design a plan for how to determine a 
          narrative’s reliability motivation and bias. 
        3.  Students will produce public service announcements for distribution in 
          their  schools  that  challenge  particular  stereotypes  in  terms  of 
          institutional, interpersonal and internalized oppression. 
        4.  Students will reflect on their history, culture and identity by evaluating 
          their consciousness around a specific institution or structure that has 
          influenced their lives by creating a visual representation to illustrate their 
          ideas  (using  educational  applications  like  Canva  or  PowerPoint)  and 
          writing a reflection that highlights their forms of resistance. 
        
       Unit 4: Social Movement and Advocacy 
       In  this  final  unit,  students  study  various  past  social  movements,  analyzing 
       similarities  and  differences  in  the  approaches  taken  by  different  groups  in 
       overcoming oppression to gain an understanding of the most effective techniques 
       used in the past. Using this knowledge, students answer the essential question: 
       How might we continue to promote positive identities as scholars and community 
       members  through  our  continued  engagement  in  advancing  our  studies, 
       strengthening our community and advocating in favor of ideas that counter 
       racism and oppression? Students will synthesize what they have learned and 
       develop a passion project around contemporary issues that interest them most. 
        
       Key Assignments: 
        1.  Students will continue their journals, using them to reflect on their roles 
          in the social movements of today and how they can effectively advocate for 
          themselves and others.  
        2.  Students will compare at least two social movements with a small group, 
          based on interest, and then verbally present information to the class. 
          Following the presentations, students will complete a 1-page reflection 
          paper on larger themes across multiple social movement groups and how 
          different  social  groups  support  one  another throughout history to the 
          present day. 
        3.  Through  an  in-class  exploration,  students  will  investigate  community 
          involvement on a local level (Consider: Mayor, School Site Council, Student 
          govt., city council, school board, etc.). As an end product, students will 
          engage in a discussion thread to share their learning. To engage more 
          meaningfully, they will respond to others’ posts.  
        4.  As culminating activity for the course, students will select a contemporary 
          social justice topic (e.g., racism, LGBTQ rights, immigration rights, access 
          to quality health care, income inequality, War on Drugs, school-to-prison-
                         pipeline,  poverty,  religious  persecution,  access  to  equitable  public 
                         education, and gangs and violence) to explore more deeply through a 
                         passion project. Students will conduct research to identify, evaluate and 
                         interpret an issue that needs to be addressed and pose a solution and plan 
                         of action that is connected to topics that were analyzed in a previous unit 
                         of  study.  Students  will  research  multiple  sources  and  current 
                         organizations to determine what social inequalities still exist and put their 
                         ideas into action through civic engagement. Students will be paired with a 
                         peer support partner throughout the research process. Projects might 
                         include: Proposing a bill or law, podcast, writing a song, creating art, 
                         designing a mural, website, social media campaign, photo series, blog, 
                         video,  celebratory  letter,  critical  letter,  planning  an  event,  etc.  These 
                         projects will be presented in a gallery walk as an exhibition.
