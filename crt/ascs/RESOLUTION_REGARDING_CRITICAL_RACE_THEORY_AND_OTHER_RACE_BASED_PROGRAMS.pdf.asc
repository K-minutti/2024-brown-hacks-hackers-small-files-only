                                                                                  
                                                             RESOLUTION 
                                                                       
                  
                 RESOLUTION REGARDING CRITICAL RACE THEORY AND OTHER RACE-
                 BASED PROGRAMS 
                  
                 A RESOLUTION OF THE BOARD OF EDUCATION (BOE) OF EL PASO COUNTY 
                 COLORADO SCHOOL DISTRICT 49 (D49), DECLARING ITS OFFICIAL OPPOSITION TO 
                 THE USE OF CRITICAL RACE THEORY AND OTHER RACE-BASED TRAINING, 
                 CURRICULA, AND METHODOLOGY IN PUBLIC EDUCATION. 
                  
                 Definition:  As defined in Edweek.com, The core idea of Critical Race Theory "is that racism is a 
                 social construct, and that it is not merely the product of individual bias or prejudice, but also 
                 something embedded in legal systems and policies."  
                  
                 WHEREAS, The Colorado Constitution, in Article IX, Section 15, declares that the directors of 
                 each local school district <shall have control of instruction in the public schools of their respective 
                 districts,= and C.R.S. 22-32-109 sets forth the role of this Board to <determine the educational 
                 programs to be carried on in the schools of the district and to prescribe the textbooks for any course 
                 of instruction or study in such programs.=; and  
                  
                 WHEREAS, Public Education, properly designed, includes age-appropriate exposure to history, 
                 philosophies, and structures which comprise the American experience.  Pertinent instruction 
                 regarding history of racism and inequality in America should not purport to deliberately undermine 
                 race groups, student/family values, religious beliefs, or founding principles; and 
                  
                 WHEREAS, Public educators are not authorized to endorse or proselytize on behalf of a specific 
                 perspective in any areas of faith, civil rights, economics, international affairs, sociology, or politics; 
                 and 
                  
                 WHEREAS, Critical Race Theory (CRT), antiracism, and all related, euphemistic, surrogates should 
                 similarly not be advocated in any form, in D49’s curricula or staff training; and 
                  
                 WHEREAS, D49 schools and teachers are expected to provide a comprehensive education on 
                 America’s history that neither sanitizes its past, nor denies the possibility of moral progress; and 
                  
                 WHEREAS, D49 partners with parents to assist in their responsibility to educate their children in 
                 accordance with the principle that America is a nation founded on the principle that all men and 
                 women are created equal; complemented by the Civil Rights Act of 1964. 
                  
                 NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT RESOLVED AS FOLLOWS: 
                  
                 D49 will not utilize Critical Race Theory or antiracism curriculum for student education or any staff 
                 training.  With this statement, D49 reiterates that: 
                        Schools may not use race as a consideration when hiring or administering academic 
                         programs or evaluation systems.  
                        Neither schools, nor instructors, shall have students participate in class or complete 
                                                                       
                         assignments on the basis of race.  
                        Schools shall not discipline students differently on the basis of race. 
                        Schools shall not engage in racial stereotyping, including ascribing character traits, values, 
                         moral and ethical codes, privileges, status, or beliefs on the basis of race. 
                        Schools may not force individuals to admit privilege or to <reflect,= <deconstruct,= or 
                         <confront= their racial identities. 
                  
                 BE IT ALSO RESOLVED THAT: 
                  
                 District 49, as a whole, will embrace and implement the tenants of our Vision and Mission, the 
                 Cultural Compass and Strategic Priorities (Big Rocks) in how we approach our work and how we 
                 treat each other. 
                  
                 Nothing in these resolutions shall be construed to restrict any expressive activities protected under 
                 the Constitution, including academic freedom or student political speech. 
                  
                 ADOPTED AND APPROVED this 8th day of July 2021
