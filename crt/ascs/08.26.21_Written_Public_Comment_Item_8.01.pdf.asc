          Hello Trustees, 
          Please stop the discrimination against non-vaccinated students and staff!

          As a teacher, I wanted to thank the board & Dr. Jara for implementing & enforcing the mask mandate for all. I felt safe the
          first week of school and my students followed the mask wearing protocol 100%. We had zero Covid cases in my
          classroom! Regardless of the louder voices at the board meetings, please continue to follow the science. And, thank you
          for all you do as you navigate through these difficult issues. There are many people who appreciate you, although they
          just may not be as "vocal" as those who show up at your meetings!

          Dear Clark County School Board,
          I am a parent of a 6th grader 
          I appreciate that the board is following public health guidelines for COVID-19.   
          From what I understand of the current COVID-19 public health guidelines, I express my strong support in these areas: 
                All COVID safety measures.   
                Requiring masks.
                Requiring all staff to be vaccinated (with narrow exemptions for medical reasons).
                Requiring all age-eligible students to be vaccinated  (with narrow exemptions for medical reasons).
          Thank you for your service to your community.
          Sincerely,
          Fred Van Dyk

          Superintendent Jara, Trustees,
          For the record, my name is Robert Cowles. 
          The district absolutely needs a code of ethics. I would suggest the Model Code of Educator Ethics. I would also suggest mechanisms to
          report and investigate ethical violations be placed in a separate policy, preferably backed by specific NRS/NAC.
          When I was on the state committee discussing teacher ethics, established by AB-124 in the 2017 legislative session, we discussed the model
          code of educator ethics, and how it should be implemented. There was agreement among the committee that training would be required,
          after receiving several hours of training on the model code from one of the primary authors. 
          I am concerned that Regulation 3100 will be used to silence educators who advocate for adequate resources and facilities for all students. It
          is difficult to be an "ambassador of the district" when students' needs are not being met. In many cases, the district is unable to meet the
          needs of our students because they are lacking a qualified teacher. This year we have the added problem of not enough substitute teachers
          to fill those vacancies.
          I have mentioned the solutions to these specific issues at great length previously, so I will not do so again here. 
          Thank you for your time and consideration,
          Robert

                Dear Clark County School District Board of Trustees: 
                 
                The Nevada Commission on Minority Affairs supports the efforts of the Clark County School 
                District Board of Trustees in creating the Anti-Racism, Equity, and Inclusion Task Force to 
                develop an anti-racism policy for the Clark County School District. The task force is essential for 
                fostering safety, equity, and inclusion in our schools, and sends a signal to the community that 
                these matters are taken seriously. 
                 
                We applaud the extensive efforts by the Board of Trustees in seeking community input for this 
                external task force, reaching out to members of the public and advocates in diverse 
                communities to submit their interest for the external taskforce, and making the interest form 
                available in both English and Spanish. We appreciate the transparency of breaking out the race 
                and ethnicity of applicants at the Board of Trustees meeting on June 24th and hope that this 
                process will lead to an equitable, inclusive, and diverse representation of all communities on 
                the task force. 
                 
                We look forward to the policy work that comes out of this task force.

          I am emailing for public comment at the CCSD Trustee's meeting on August 26th regarding the CCSD Budget.
          I have 3 children that have attended the school district and I am ALARMED by the continued failure of this school board.
          You have received record amounts of funding and still parents are asked to buy text books, teachers are asked to supply
          their own classrooms. 
          Your school district budget is over 2.2 billion.  Where is all the money?  How is this obvious mismanagement of funds
          acceptable.  CCSD's lack of vision and unpreparedness makes our entire community suffer.  As you continue to be
          focused on the wrong thing all the time, playing politics.  When your only concern should be the education of our
          children.  
          Year after Year we are continually ranked near the bottom nationally.  A lesson proving that even 2.2 billion can not fix
          your ineptness. 
          CCSD has failed the people they serve, the students, the teachers and the parents.
          If CCSD would have the community best interest in mind it would admit to its failing and agree to be broken up into
          smaller more localized school districts.
          Break up CCSD for the good of the community.
          Thank you

          I am emailing for agenda item 5.01 at the CCSD Trustee's meeting on August 26th regarding the Anti Racism Policy
          Development Work.
          I was one of the individuals who expressed an interest on your online form.   I did not receive a confirmation email for my
          submittal nor an update on how the process was going.   Weeks ago I sent an email to you President Cavasos asking
          where we were at in the process of selecting the task force.  My email of course went ignored.
          The handling of this process just confirms to me that it is CCSD that is RACIST.  How can we trust you to put together a
          task force when your process continues to exclude, divide, put people into boxes and label them.  You separate,
          segregate and show favoritism.
          This behavior is OUTRAGEOUS! It should make everyone start questioning:
          Who was it, that decided what a diverse group of the community looks like ?
          Who decided, who the EXPERTS would be?
          We the people need to know since this is the group that will be developing the anti-racism policy.
          We can not trust CCSD with their demonstrated bias and racist start to this task force.
          I recommend that you, the CCSD School Board and its selection process be investigated.  The community should
          demand transparency.
          Thank you

          What is being done to recruit more bus drivers? 
          At present many kids are waiting 30 to 90 minutes for buses to become available to give them rides to school or back
          home from school. 
          We have received no communication from the district about this at all.

           Something has to be done about the crosswalks for middle school, and possibly highschool, in the morning. My child, and
           many others, are terrified to cross alone. My child goes to         however I've found through social media that this is a
           consistent problem at all middle schools and some highschools too. None of the cars use the 4 way stop appropriately
           and drop kids off anywhere near it. Because of this some of the kids simply run out, since there's no way to figure out
           when it's appropriate to go. when the police are there, it only solves it while they are present. I've almost been hit a few
           times and we're only a few weeks into the year. I hear from other parents that it's been this way for years, never a
           permanent solution. How do we send kids to school, but force them to risk their lives getting there? Our school has a
           teacher helping with the crosswalk after school, and I appreciate that so much. I know it's not in their job description,
           pluss they don't have a stop sign or anything, just their body and a walkie. We need help to keep our kids, and teachers,
           safe.
           If I didn't have a toddler with me I would volunteer to be a crossing guard myself, but I can't do that with it being so
           dangerous. Can we get someone out there permanent? Something?

      5.02 Substitute Teachers and Substitute Support Professionals
      Presentation. 
      I am AGAINST hiring Education Staffing Services!! While this proposal may look good
      on paper, it is NOT a true assessment of the situation. It is NOT logical and I do NOT
      trust the numbers here. 
      CCSD will NOT know that those hired are vetted according to CCSD policies and
      requirements. Next, the people managing the substitutes will be getting a big chunk of
      the money, which means: Substitutes Teachers and Substitute Support Staff will
      get LESS!!!!! Simple logic!
      Simply give benefits to Long-term and Vacancy subs . Next, offer at a reasonable rate,
      an HMO Health Insurance Plan to subs working 21 hours or more. Simple. You may
      have to hire 2-3 extra payroll and benefits employees, maybe even 4-5; but that will be
      WAY LESS than hiring a company to manage subs!!! Please do NOT Outsource.
      Quality will go down. And quite honestly, this plan will NOT fulfill the goal of providing
      the needed qualified Substitute Teachers at CCSD.
      I was part of the full-time Pilot Substitute Teacher program. It was very successful!!
      CCSD can do this in-house!! I know they can because they did it before!! 
      Respectfully,
      Autumn Tampa

     School Reopening

      I find it absurd that we are reopening when none of the elementary students are eligible to be vaccinated. It is unsafe.
      Students, and staff have tested positive. There is no way to enforce social distancing given the square footage of each
      classroom. I am National Board Certified and cannot adhere to social distancing and teach full project based lessons
      when the students have no access to materials and cannot interact with each other. I think it is cruel to keep students in
      their seats away from others in order to keep them safe. They should be home with families that care about them and at
      least have freedom of movement. I lack cleaning supplies, other materials the students need, and I even lack WATER to

       Hi Board Members, 
       I am against all these mandates. Kids do not need to wear masks, as they don't get Covid that often nor do they spread it
       to others (per the CDC). And with the vaccines, the FDA now says kids under 16 should not take the vaccine. As noted
       here: 
       August 24, 2021
       The agency granted full approval to Pfizer's vaccine yesterday for people 16 and
       older.
       Pfizer's COVID vaccine should not be given to young children off-label. That's according
       to the head of the FDA. 
       The agency granted full approval to Pfizer's vaccine yesterday for people 16 and older –
       but says it still needs more data on children younger than 12.  
       For that reason, it says those kids should not get the vaccine – even at a smaller
       dosage.
       YOU CAN NOT MANDATE ANYTHING FOR THESE KIDS! It needs to be by the
       parents' choice of what they want for their kids. You are going down a slippery slope
       here with these mandates and "rules" you think are the right thing to do, BUT IT IS NOT
       YOUR JOB!
       Please leave this up to the parents and keep out.
       Thank you, 
       Ashley Abbott

       Vaccinated players are banned from playing

       To: boardmtgcomments@nv.ccsd.net, 
         Why is there a mandatory 10 day shutdown on sports team for one positive case within ccsd. Current protocols for
         vaccinated students is they do not have to quarantine. But a team of vaccinated players gets their game cancelled if one
         unvaccinated player tests positive during the testing week. In addition the team is SHUT DOWN for the mandatory 10
         day. 
         This is punishing the vaccinated athletes! The district is asking all students of age to vaccinated. Why would a team of
         vaccinated athletes be excluded from playing their game? This is the policy that has been given to our school athletic’s
         departments and it will be discouraging for students to vaccinate if they are prohibited from competitions.
         If this is SNHD policy, please someone, anyone, let me know and I will personally connect with Dr. Lohff and
         commissioner Kirkpatrick and have this changed. 
         Sincerely 
         Kimberley Brock

      I am High School Counselor here in the Clark County School District. 
      Supt. Jara you have chosen to turn your back on educators and reopened schools in a disorganized and unsafe way. 
      It has been three months since the end of the Nevada legislative session, one month into the school year, and yet there is
      still no contract for educators.
      It is time Supt. Jara, to stop turning your back on educators, provide safe working conditions for students and
      staff, and give educators a contract that respects us as professionals.

          Hello,
           
          It has become increasingly clear that the school board and district are either unwilling or unable to address 
          some of the serious crises we are currently facing.  Chronic issues like sub shortages, overstuffed 
          classrooms, teacher retention, and lack of clear communication have been discussed ad infinitum for years, 
          but all that talk has led to no substivie action.  Perhaps if you actually fixed some of the issues that 
          perpetually crop up, our district wouldn’t be consistently in disarray.   Our students deserve better.

                    Re:    August 26, 2021 Board of School Trustees Meeting; Reference 5.02(A); 
                           Outsourcing Substitute Teachers and Substitute Support Professionals
              Dear Pres. Cavazos:
                    The Education Support Employees Association (<ESEA=) hereby submits this public 
              comment regarding Reference 5.02(A), a contemplated contract with Education Staffing Services 
              (<ESS=).  ESEA was alerted to this Agenda item in advance by the District’s Lead Negotiator, 
              Fikisha Miller.  In impact bargaining discussions with Ms. Miller, the District assured ESEA that 
              no education support professionals in the ESEA Bargaining Unit would be adversely affected if 
              the District decided to move forward with a contract to outsource recruitment and daily 
              placement of substitute teachers and substitute support professionals for classroom instruction.  
              The District has assured ESEA that no ESEA Bargaining Unit members would lose their jobs nor 
              would any such Employees suffer a reduction in hours.  Stated differently, the District has 
              assured ESEA that there would be no adverse impact if the District entered into the 
              contemplated contract with ESS.
                    Although ESEA cannot state that it is in support of the contract under consideration, or 
              any contract that outsources ESEA Bargaining Unit work, it does appreciate the challenges the 
              District faces in placing substitutes and the fact that those challenges have been exacerbated by 
              the COVID-19 pandemic.  As it has in the past, ESEA asks that the Board of School Trustees 
              remain mindful of the following deleterious effects of outsourcing:
                    There are adverse effects on worker morale and workplace cohesion as a result of co-
                 
                    workers having different supervisors, different pay scales and different training, 
                    recognition and benefits

                        allow for private contractor profits.
                        When school workers work for a private contractor rather than the District, there is 
                    
                        confusion over accountability.  The involvement of a private contractor muddies the

                        the buck,= and other District staff and parent concerns are not timely and effectively 
                        addressed.
                        Private contractors often underestimate or low-ball initial bids to get the contract, then 
                    
                        raise fees later.
                        Privatization of any service carries a risk of corruption.  There is a dark history of 
                    
                        nepotism, cronyism, bribery, kickbacks and payoffs in some contracting businesses.  This 
                        is why the civil service was created.

          Good evening,
          I’ve enclosed two screenshots from Kelli Sommer who is an assistant principal at our daughters high school.
          As a parent I’m outraged and supremely disappointed.
          We currently have  a daughter at home recovering from COVID-19. We’re deeply offended by this post!
          To see someone who is not just an employee of CCSD BUT in a leadership position at our daughters school post this is
          mind blowing. This woman is in a position of power. How is this acceptable? 
           
          I know Mrs. Sarabyn addressed this just a few hours ago via a voicemail and email  BUT I want you all to know this is
          upsetting to a lot of parents, not to mention students. I’m hoping this was the one she was referring too and that
          leadership just hasn’t gone rogue at Cimmaron. 
          This is in parent groups, CCSD groups etc, there’s no just erasing this.
          In healthcare we fight for life, we do our best everyday. To wish death on people
          Is disgusting. This seems like bullying and discrimination to me. I’m saddened that this person is one of many who’s in
          charge at my daughters school.
           We have to do better CCSD this is unacceptable.

          I am writing to let you know that I feel teachers need more support from the board in medical insurance.  CCSD would not
          allow us to raise the premium we pay for our insurance and the Trust almost went bankrupt.  Please give teachers and
          support staff as much money as you pay for administrators.  We raised our union dues to have money to petition the
          legislature and lobby for more money.  We got the money and now need you to give us our share.  No other Union
          worked for the good of the entire district.  We did.  Please be fair to those who gave our extra dues money to help CCSD
          as a whole.  Thank you.

          When decisions are made by CCSD without a clear vision it creates chaos. No one seems to think about the
          consequences on the people doing the work nor the stress it puts on families. The last minute decision to make NVLA the
          only online choice for families without preparing the small staff was disrespectful to the staff as they left them with no
          answers but an unwritten message to just fix it. The blame should start at the top and with those board members
          approving this process with no support for our school. Your decisions matter. They affect families and staff. Leaving us to
          figure it all out was not fair to those who are in the midst of the work. Be a part of the solution and not part of creating the
          problems. NVLA should matter to the school district but sure feels like you left us to fend for ourselves and that no one
          cared we were not equipped to handle the expectations. Check on NVLA for yourselves so they know they matter in the
          transition process.

        School COVID transparency and mitigation concerns

         Hello,
         My name is Zachary                I’m a senior                                 Ever since COVID first
         emerged in the end of 2019/beginning of 2020, i’ve expressed concern over the enforcement of
         mitigation measures in relation to COVID. At                         School, and what seems to be
         other schools in the district, students don’t adhere to mitigation measures and mandates in place,
         the school isn’t adequately cleaned to the liking of most for us for still being in a pandemic, social
         distancing isn’t achievable due to how small the classrooms are, etc.
         Myself and others in the school don’t feel that the district or the school is doing all that it can to
         enforce mitigation strategies or transparency as there have only been 2 general COVID
         notifications since August 9, 2021, but I was informed that there were more known COVID cases in
         the school. Also, students with known exposure to individuals who have tested positive weren’t
         being forced to quarantine in most situations.
         More transparency is needed from individual schools, and CCSD as a whole to ensure students,
         staff, and parents confidence in the district during these still uncertain times.
         Please work with students, parents, and teachers alike with equal respect to make us feel as safe
         as possible when in an educational environment by creating and providing adequate resources,
         guidelines, procedures, and transparency.
         Thank you,
         Zachary

          To the Superintendent and the Board of Trustees, 
          It is unacceptable that the teachers do not have a new contract. We are asking for our cost of living adjustment, health
          insurance adjustment, and our step increase that is being illegally withheld. It is the least we should get considering that
          we delivered more than 500 million dollars to CCSD. Our labor group is the one that committed in 2019 to increasing
          education funding in Nevada. It only took us two years to successfully do just that. It is more of a shame every day that
          the district drags its feet and blows us off in negotiations.

       Lack of support

         Good Afternoon. 
         As you know, the lack of trained staff is extremely alarming for parents. It puts our kids at serious risk. Especially those
         with special needs. Substitute teachers aren’t cutting it. The district needs to use ALL funds to improve teacher retention
         and quality of life for them. Happy teachers make for a better teaching environment for our children.  
         This particularly important because we need solid teachers for distance learning as well. I’m disappointed at how we are
         handling covid in the district, especially at the elementary school level. Maskless cafeterias, large classrooms, no
         temperature checks, lack of mandatory vaccination and refusal of transparency is the opposite of taking this disease
         seriously.  
         Parents know you want the money on September 10th, but you are doing nothing to earn it. Mark my words, more
         children will be pulled out due to your actions.

          Akiko Cooks and the #1865 group are racist, anti-America, and openly supports CRT. Akiko and her group should not be
          part of the anti-racism policy group.
          She is trying to get rich off propaganda and cause division amongst CCSD parents and students. 
          She has posted hundreds of racist posts and tweets on social media, as well as threatened other parents and school
          board trustees. 
          Below are a couple posts on social media the group ran by Akiko has posted: 
          "And as for Trustee Garcia you ought to be more careful who you keep company with."
          "Dear Black people, we have been conditioned to be proud of a country that hates us."
          "if this is y'all homegirl tell her the #1865 Momz wanna holla at her about this Black privilege" 
          "If critical race theory threatens your Christianity, you may be worshipping whiteness"
          "I think we should host a watch party for the next CCSD board meeting. We can watch the white fragility and racist cry
          together."
          "White ppl will just take anything they hear black people say and just run with it. No critical thinking, just vibes" 
          "I've never seen a be er example of white fragility than this"
          The definition of racism: The belief that race accounts for differences in human character or ability and that a
          particular race is superior to others.

          My comments are related to high-school student athletes. 
          As you are aware, the current management of high school athletic teams as it relates to COVID testing is 
          that if one student tests positive, the entire team is quarantined and cannot participate in the scheduled 
          game. Not to mention the team they were scheduled to play that may have had no positive covid tests is 
          also penalized and can not participate in the athletic contest. 
          Do you know what the term discriminate means?
          Discriminate: make an unjust or prejudicial distinction in the treatment of different categories of people.
          I feel like SNHD is discriminating how they penalize student athletes and athletic teams compared to how SNHD 
          manages and or penalizes individuals and teams or crews in any other team, organization, or business setting.
          Can you imagine if the same management that SNHD is applying to student athletes teams were applied to other 
          organizations, businesses or emergency response personnel?
          Let me give you a few examples:
                You want to get groceries at your local grocery store but one member of the store staff tested positive so 
                the entire staff had to be quarantined for 14-days. Hopefully every grocery store in the valley did not 
                experience one positive test at the same time or else all grocery stores would close.
                You experienced a heart attack and need immediate attention but one member of the ambulance crew 
                tested positive so the entire crew team is unavailable. Yes there are other ambulances but what if every 
                crew had a positive test at the same time. 
          There is a legal term you are all familiar with, innocent until proven guilty. This approach should be utilized with 
          our student athletes as it pertains to allowing them to play in their corresponding sport. 
          This should be the approach for our student athletes on teams. If a football player on a team wants to step on the 
          field for a contest, proof of a negative COVID test should be required. Any with a positive test would not be 
          allowed on the field. An entire team should not be penalized for one member of the team having a positive test. 
          Surely students and parents would be taking precautions anyways if their child was experiencing COVID 
          symptoms and would not put that child/player in a situation to transmit to other players. 
           
          The overreach of making an entire team not participate in a contest is discriminating and needs to be adjusted 
          immediately.

          Subject: Item 5.02 Substitute Teacher, Substitute Support Staff Presentation
          Greetings Madame President, Members of the Board, and Superintendent Jara, 
          It is clear as day that there is a problem. The school district believes that the problem is a shortage of teachers and a 
          shortage of subs; however they are observing the symptoms and not the disease. The root of the problem is the lack of 
          respect, mistreatment, and the low pay. The COVID-19 pandemic has just exacerbated and exposed problems that have 
          always existed within the district. A reasonable person wouldn't think to fix a broken car window with a roll of tape (this roll 
          of tape costs $10M), but that's what CCSD does year after year.
          Educators love their jobs but many have issues with how they are treated by admin and the district. Subs have been left 
          behind as teachers and the CCEA have fought for raises each year. Even then, CCSD struggles to retain teachers due to 
          low pay and large class sizes. Also, Nevada would fare better if our education system created a pipeline for future 
          educators instead of hiring teachers who will go home after they've had enough. In January 2021, substitute teachers 
          were finally given an increase in pay after months of organizing; but not given a pathway to health benefits, PTO, and 
          PERS. Not even long term and vacancy subs, burdened with all the duties of licensed teachers, were offered health 
          insurance.
          The time is NOW to improve efficiency of teacher and sub licensing as well as to increase the pay. (I know people who 
          have applied, but are waiting to get a badge). Rather than give ESS $10M, why not use that $10M for an increase in pay, 
          health benefits, and a staffing increase for sub services? We are in a pandemic after all. 
          Sincerely,
          Brandon Summers 
          Substitute Teacher

          Dear CCSD Board of Trustees,
          I believe the district should use some of the Federal Funds in Biden's new infrastructure plan that are
          appropriated for Clark County to split the school CCSD.  One of the reasons I've been told we can't split the
          district is due to the expense of crea ng new ones.  What a great opportunity we have to do it now since
          the government is providing this giant fund!
          Thank you,
          Anne McNinch

          Dr Jara and the rest of you , your rules don't work we have the worst school system for years and you have taken it to
          FAR. MY CHILDS HEALTH IS ONLY MY DECISION NOT YOURS ,NOT THE CDC, NO ONE BUT MINE! MY BODY MY
          CHOICE! Masks need to be the parents decision. I decide what my son wears not you. This is a form of child abuse
          which all of you will be held liable AND ACCOUNTABLE.
          Facts: 420 kids passed from the flu in 2019  that's more than a year and a half of this pandemic.
          During this time did anyone make our children wear masks with the flu. THE Flu is more dangerous than covid to our
          children, NO YOU DIDNT! THIS HAS BECOME A POLITICAL AGENDA!
          MASKS NEED TO BE REMOVED NOW . OUR VOICES WILL BE HEARD

        To: boardmtgcomments@nv.ccsd.net, 
          Good evening,
          My name is Ashley Tewey for the record, and I am a stay-at-home mother of two (2) CCSD elementary students, grades
          kinder and 2nd.  I do not agree nor approve of masking young children while in school.  That decision was not based on
          science but solely on liability.  There has only been one (1) study on mask effectiveness, and was deemed
          "inconclusive".  Both of my children have been suffering with severe nose bleeds due to the hot conditions inside their
          masks, and it is only week 3 of the school year.  We do not yet know of the long-term consequences in regards to
          masking young children, and I would rather my children not be in that test study!  Remove the mask mandate for all
          CCSD students before further action is forced to be taken.  Parents will pull their children from the district if our needs
          and demands are not met.  I already have the Nevada Notice of Intent in my posession, and I will be guiding other
          parents to do the same.
          P.S. My children will NOT be getting the covid-19 gene therapy technology even if it is mandated and/or FDA approved.   
           
          Disappointed and Unimpressed,
          Ashley Tewey

                  walks of life; European, Middle Eastern, Latin, and African American to name a few.  I still remember the 
                  tears of joy streaming down my face the day my Uncle Armando was Nationalized here in LV.   
                  I am a firm believer that tough conversations and educating our youth, in any subject matter, starts at 
                  home.  I raise my children with a couple mottos in mind; Be nice be kind, mind your manners, life can be 
                  hard at times but always beautiful, and 8Same, Same but Different9 - a wonderful book provided by 
                  CCSD.    
                  I will not allow my children, at any point in their lives, feel that they are oppressors just because they 
                  were born white.  It saddens me that the actions of the few represent the bunch.  I truly believe anti-
                  racist policies will further divide us as a people because it is dealing with a topic and not the issue.  If you 
                  must implement a policy for CCSD staff and administration do so, but don9t put this on our kids; they do 
                  not see color.  
                  I will leave you with a quote: 
                  <Within each of us there is an intense need to feel that we belong.  This feeling of unity and 
                  togetherness comes through the warmth of a smile, a handshake, or a hug, through laughter and 
                  unspoken demonstrations of love.  It come in the quiet, reverent moments of soft conversation and in 
                  listening.= – William R. Bradford

          Hi,
          I'm currently working as a sub, filling a long term job in pre-k.  I retired as a teacher with CCSD in 2019.
          I am very much against using ESS to supply subs to the CCSD classrooms.
          1. ESS is a third party vendor who will profit from this arrangement.  Either subs will earn less or CCSD will pay more (if
          subs were to retain the current pay).  If CCSD is going to spend more money, why not use that money to raise sub pay to
          attract more subs?  Extra money spend by CCSD or less pay for subs is just going to a for-profit company.
          2.  How will ESS be able to obtain more subs than CCSD is able to?  Where will they be getting the subs from?  I find it
          rather fishy if they are promising to get more subs.   Will they screen and background check their subs to the same extent
          as CCSD.  If they are under contractual obligation to provide subs, there will be a monetary incentive for them the cut
          corners if they can't find the subs needed.  
          3.  I don't think CCSD should be giving up power over who is in the classrooms with our students.  CCSD has a
          responsibility to educate all its students.  This appears as if CCSD is trying to abdicate that responsibility to a for-profit
          company.  Then if there are shortages or problems, CCSD can simply say "It's the vendor's (ESS) problem or issue." 
          This strikes me as CCSD shirking one of it's duties.
          Why not ask subs (currently working and those who have not returned) what it would take to get more people to sub?
          --

              Re: Agenda Item 5.01 Anti-Racism Policy Development Work      
               
              Dear Board of School Trustees, 
               
              The first order of business is to ensure that the Anti-racism policy is developed within 90 days. 
              LVABSE stands in solidarity with <No Racism in Schools, 1865.= The law is in place and we 
              want it fully implemented in our district. Racism is alive and well all around us, and especially in 
              our district. Please get the policy written so that our schools can have guidance and direction.  
               
              The second order of business. Let’s be reminded that the Las Vegas Alliance of Black School 
              Educators (LVABSE) has a long standing history of community service and contributions to the 
              CCSD. You should have been quite alarmed when a member of LVABSE or the Ministers 
              Alliance of Southern Nevada was not selected to be a part of the 38 members of the 
              Superintendent’s External Anti-racism, Equity, and Inclusion Taskforce. Please inform LVABSE 
              of the individuals or groups on this task force who will be able to provide a historical reference 
              of Historic West Las Vegas. Again, voices from Historic West Las Vegas have been left out of a 
              very important matter.  
               
              The hope is that Trustee Garcia-Morales would find some space here to advocate for her district. 
              Trustee Garcia-Morales, you had a perfect opportunity to select or urge members of the 
              community from the Matt Kelly ES Community Input Meeting to apply. It’s quite disturbing that 
              there was a perfect opportunity to include a member of Historic West Las Vegas. The digital 
              divide may have impacted members of this community from applying through the online option. 
              I’m interested to know if every person selected on the task force complete an application. 
               
              True and effective leadership requires that you lay down your personal dislike for LVABSE and 
              our advocacy and do what’s best for our students and community. Critical feedback and being 
              held accountable is a part of the position.

          CCSD is currently in violation of Nevada law by not having implemented an anti-racism policy. The law went into effect on
          July 1st. 
          You also have a trustee who openly violates that law by publicly tweeting harmful, abusive, transphobic rhetoric on her
          platform, which she uses in an official capacity. Katie Williams.
          There can be no effective policy while Katie Williams serves on the board, as she uses her platform to bully and promote
          the bullies.
          Katie Williams is violating the law openly.
          CCSD is violating the law by not implementing the policy and enforcing it.
          Write the policy.

          Today, Trustee Williams violated the ethics of her position by promoting the violation of the governor's and CCSD's mask
          mandate, protecting students and staff from COVID-9.
          Tweets celebrating students at a District B high school who removed their masks in protest were retweeted by Trustee
          Williams, endorsing & celebrating their behavior.
          We demand the immediate investigation of Trustee Williams for violating her oath of office and endorsing
          delinquent behavior in her schools, endangering the health and safety of our community.

      My name is Rebecca Garcia and I am the parent of three CCSD students as well as the President of the Nevada PTA and 
      an administrator of the CCSD Parents Group. Over the last month, I have been fielding questions, concerns, and 
      comments from families and staff regarding several critical issues that need to be brought to the attention of the board. 
      While I appreciate the efforts of Dr. Jara and some trustees to reach out as I have raised these issues publicly recently 
      none are resolved yet. 
      The vast majority of repetitive issues fall into the following areas. 
      Communication - District communications to families on essential issues for our children have been severely lacking for 
      months. The weekly updates are repetitive and missing needed updates. As the district continues to not share relevant 
      information this further erodes public confidence and trust. What will be done to address this? And the answer should not 
      be that a new CCO has been hired, CCSD's communication issues go far beyond a single hire. 
      Transportation - While we recognize the hard work of many drivers and that the dept is short-staffed that doesn't change 
      the need for students to be safely transported to school. Hiring new drivers is a weeks-long process and even longer if 
      they need to be trained for CDL so what is being done now to address the issues? 
      Health Protocols - Families and staff deserve clear, consistent, and timely updates regarding health protocols. The 
      information on ccsd.net is often out of date and not easily formated for family access. Schools seem constantly inundated 
      with ever-changing guidance and the frustration and lack of clarity is passed to families causing confusion and 
      unnecessary frustration for staff and families. Health meetings are not always happening in a timely fashion delaying 
      notification, parents attempting to notification are often put off or provided confusing information, schools are health and 
      safety policies and quarantines are not consistent. Most families receive their information from teachers and office staff 
      and yet it appears they are often the last provided the relevant information. 
      Covid Data - Again, timely and accurate covid positives and exclusions by schools should be provided to the community. 
      Dr. Jara's refusal to do so is inconsistent with dozens of other states and districts across the country and even here in 
      Nevada as Washoe provides this information. Parents and staff are not asking for identifying information, a letter is sent to 
      the entire school community when there is a positive there is no reason that should not then be included immediately in 
      the CCCD Dashboard along with if exclusions occur. The total number of district exclusions should also be published in a 
      timely manner. For reference the WCSD Covid Data: https://www.washoeschools.net/Page/15625
      Example dashboard from Hillsborough (FL) https://www.hillsboroughschools.org/coviddashboard
      Staff Shortages - Beyond transportation, there are staff shortages across the district. This directly impacts students. 
      While these shortages aren't unique to CCSD and are being felt across the nation immediate solutions are needed to 
      ensure students receive the best possible education especially after a tumultuous distance education year. We continually 
      hear concerns of feeling unsupported and overwhelmed by constantly changing directives that add extra duties or cause 
      confusion. The emotional well-being of all the CCSD community is important for student success. Further, the shifting 
      numbers of students to NVLA, etc will have potentially cause more staffing issues after count day and strategic budgets 
      are reopened. What is the plan to address without causing more upheaval for students and staff? 
      The pandemic has caused overwhelming upheaval with heightened student needs and rampant staff shortages but the 
      core mission of CCSD is to provide all students a quality education. That requires that students are safely learning and 
      the above mention issues are a hurdle to making sure that happens for every student, in every zip code, every day. 
      Regards,
      Rebecca Garcia

        8.01 Non Agenda Items 
        1 message
        KRISSI Alba [Foothill HS]                                                               Thu, Aug 26, 2021 at 1:48 PM

          Hello Madam President and Members of the board. I previously wrote a letter that I believe falls under 8.01 Non Agenda
          Items.
          Since writing the letter, my family tested positive for Covid in July after exposure. I wasn9t allowed back to work until
          August 11. Along with being quarantined during June enrichment for exposure, my paychecks were very short and very
          much needed. Rent is late, bills are past due, stress is high. Hazard pay would9ve helped cover that.
          Here is the short version of the letter previously sent:
          <My name is Krissi and I am a Title 1 SPTA for the STAR program (children with emotional trauma and aggression
          disorders for those who are not familiar).
          I returned to work in the classroom in April and worked through the June acceleration program.
          While in the class, I had children purposely pull my mask down and cough in my face, smear snot on us, and force
          themselves to vomit. We were not allowed to send kids to the nurse office, in fact, the offices were kept locked and even
          staff couldn9t go inside. We had to assess the children ourselves, call the nurse or FASA to discuss any ailments to decide
          if the Child needed sent home. If it was decided so, the FASA or nurse was seen in their hazmat gear.
          I was given a paper mask and some hand sanitizer.
          During June accelerator, I was exposed to 2 definite covid cases within the school. I am vaccinated so I was fine to work,
          until I developed cold symptoms. At which time, Emocha yellow carded me and I couldn't return to work. Even after a
          negative covid test, it was a struggle to return. Due to it being June enrichment, I was not able to get paid anything for the
          time lost. 
          I am not jealous or angry that nurses, FASAs, or backups receiving stipends. I am bothered because they received so
          much.  The ones who were less protected and directly in contact were the ones who were overlooked and given nothing.
          We didn't receive gowns or N95 masks. We weren't given a warning if the Child was sick. We didn't get to stay behind
          locked doors. 
          We were there, face to face, teaching these children. Constantly worrying if that child who just spit in our face, or just
          vomited on the floor exposed us to anything dangerous.
          I lost 2 grandparents to this virus , 4 other family members were hospitalized, my father in law became ridiculously ill. So
          while this pandemic may seem like a political move to some, it is very real to this family. For the ones who were locked
          away and protected to receive $10000-$15000 or more in hazard pay, while we received nothing. It hurts.
          I bring home less than $2000/mo. To lose out on pay due to covid exposure in a family of 4 hurts us financially. So trust
          that hazard pay would have been helpful. Not a vacation, or new car,  or some luxury. That is rent being paid, that is
          getting caught up on utility payments. That is our lifeline.
          Job stability within the district in nonexistent. Our pay goes up, it goes down, insurance goes up, pay still goes down.
          Hours are up, hours are down. Positions are cut, then replaced. 8I'm sorry9 doesn9t matter if we are being overlooked.
          Support staff is asking to be recognized. Hear our stories. Understand why we are upset.
          See us, have empathy, and understand we are coming to you for a solution, not to complain.
          I do not look for sympathy, but I do hope for inclusion and recognition as do so many others who work for you. I
          appreciate you taking the time to read this and hope you will take it seriously.=
          Thank you,
          Krissi
