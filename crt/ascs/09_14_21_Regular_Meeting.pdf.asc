                  7.01  Standing Committee Reports 
                        Dr. Warner reported that the school board’s Finance and Budget Committee met on September 9. 
                        The committee made its final edits to the proposed FY23 Budget Priorities and is recommending that 
                        the Board adopt the priorities this evening. The committee also discussed large class sizes, staffing 
                        shortage areas, and employee salary scales. As one of several recruitment and retention tools, the 
                        committee will be recommending that the Board amend Policy 2105 (Nonresidents) to allow full-
                        time nonlicensed staff who live outside Stafford County to enroll their children in our schools. 
                        Dr. Warner also reported that the school board’s Governance Committee met on September 13. The 
                        committee reviewed proposed amendments to Policy 1121 (Electronic Participation in Meetings 
                        from Remote Locations). The amendments are required due to recent changes to Virginia laws. The 
                        committee also received information regarding updates to our Title IX policy, which are the result of 
                        a federal update. Additionally, the committee reviewed proposed amendments to a number of 
                        4,000-series policies (Human Resources policies). Dr. Warner further stated that the committee 
                        reviewed a draft school board resolution for the creation of a new ad hoc school transportation 
              Approved by the School Board on October 12, 2021.                                                  P a g e  2

                        resolution and all of the proposed policy amendments. 
              8.  BOARD MEMBER COMMENTS 
                  8.01  Board Member Comments 
                        Ms. Healy spoke of her deep frustration about our lack of communication to parents regarding late 
                        buses. She requested that staff improve communication to parents. 
                        Ms. Hollerback urged Dr. Jones to let the Board know if more personnel resources are needed to 
                        assist Transportation staff to answer parent phone calls. 
                        Dr. Chase agreed with Ms. Healy’s comments and also expressed concern about students missing 
                        instructional time due to late buses.  
                        Dr. Chase stated for the record that Critical Race Theory (CRT) is not part of our curriculum and, to 
                        her knowledge, is not being taught in any of our schools. She also condemned the recent adoption of 
                        a resolution by the board of supervisors regarding the teaching of CRT. 
                        Ms. Yeung stated that when the Board decided in May to change the school start times this year, it 
                        may have contributed to the transportation problem that we are now experiencing. She believes the 
                        Board needs to relook at the start times. Ms. Yeung also wishes to provide some type of 
                        compensation to parents who are transporting their own and neighbors’ children to school. 
                        Ms. Randall spoke about the divisions that exist today in our society – both national and local. She 
                        also expressed her hope that we will be able to shorten the required duration of our quarantines so 
                        that students will lose less in-person instructional time. Further, Ms. Randall requested that we 
                        establish vaccine clinics in all four quadrants of the county for the convenience of students and 
                        parents. She also expressed deep concern for the lost instructional time due to chronically late 
                        buses. 
                        Dr. Warner thanked parents for their patience and cooperation as we struggle to resolve the many 
                        transportation issues. She then echoed Dr. Chase’s assurance that SCPS does not teach CRT. She 
                        spoke of the difference between CRT and the subject of equity. Dr. Warner stated she shares  
                        Dr. Chase’s concern regarding the board of supervisors’ recently adopted CRT resolution. 
                        Ms. Hazard spoke of the partnerships that make it possible to educate our County’s children. She 
                        also stated that our staff are diligently trying to find ways to resolve the transportation issues that 
                        are causing frustration for everyone.  
              9.  SUPERINTENDENT COMMENTS 
                  9.01  Interim Superintendent Comments 
                        Dr. Jones stated that he hopes to have transportation data to share with the Board members within 
                        the next few days. He also reported that the Transportation Department has been holding bus driver 
                        recruitment drives and training classes. Every effort is being made to onboard as many qualified new 
                        drivers as possible. Dr. Jones then invited Executive Director of Transportation Keba Baldwin to 
                        update the Board on what has been done in recent days to improve communication. Mr. Baldwin 
                        explained the communication processes that are being followed by his staff.

                         Ms. Healy moved, and Dr. Warner seconded, that the Board move this item from Information (as 
                         Item 12.03) to Action (as Item 11.01). The motion passed by a vote of six ayes and no nays.

              Approved by the School Board on October 12, 2021.                                                  P a g e  4 
              School Board Meeting                                                                September 14, 2021 (7:00 p.m.) 
      
      
                  11.02  Approval of the Proposed FY23-FY32 Stafford County Public Schools Capital Improvement 
                         Program (CIP) and <3R= Infrastructure Plan 
                         Ms. Hazard noted that page 29 of the proposed CIP/3R plan talks about our aging infrastructure. 
                         She pointed everyone’s attention to the age of the Fleet Services and support services  
                         facilities (c. 1980 and c. 1998, respectively). She strongly believes that the FY23-FY32 capital 
                         improvement plan should include a project to address the Fleet Services facility. With our county’s 
                         explosive growth, it would be far more efficient and cost-effective to have at least two Fleet 
                         Services shops (one in each half of the county). She stressed the importance of telling the board of 
                         supervisors about our needs. 
                         Ms. Healy recommended tasking the new transportation advisory committee with looking at this 
                         issue and providing recommendations. Dr. Chase and Dr. Warner agreed. 
                         Ms. Healy also requested that the Joint Schools Working Committee discuss the issue of shared 
                         Fleet Services at its next meeting. 
                         Dr. Chase moved, and Dr. Warner seconded, that the Board approve the proposed FY23-FY32 CIP 
                         and 3R Infrastructure Plan. The motion passed by a vote of six ayes and no nays. Ms. Yeung was 
                         unable to cast a vote due to technical difficulties. 
                  11.03  Adoption of the School Board’s FY23 Budget Priorities 
                         Ms. Hazard asked her fellow Board members to consider amending the proposed document to 
                         include a statement about establishing an agreement with the local funding body to begin providing 
                         a certain percentage of funding over what the State provides. That is truly the only way we will be 
                         able to compete with other school divisions for high quality staff and faculty. 
                         Dr. Warner advocated for maintaining some flexibility and recommended against committing to any 
                         particular percentage. But she agrees that the school board does need to work with the board of 
                         supervisors on a long-term strategy to improve our competitiveness. 
                         Dr. Chase moved, and Dr. Warner seconded, that the Board adopt the proposed school board 
                         FY23 budget priorities. The motion passed by a vote of six ayes and no nays. Ms. Yeung was 
                         unable to cast a vote due to technical difficulties. 
                  11.04  Adoption of a Proposed Amendment to Policy 1403 (School Attendance Areas) 
                         Dr. Warner and Ms. Healy voiced their support for the amended draft policy. 
                         Dr. Warner moved, and Ms. Healy seconded, that the Board adopt the proposed amendment to 
                         Policy 1403. The motion passed by a vote of six ayes and no nays. Ms. Yeung was unable to cast 
                         a vote due to technical difficulties. 
                  11.05  Adoption of a Resolution for the Formation of a One-Year Ad Hoc Transportation Advisory 
                         Committee 
                         The Board members reviewed the proposed resolution and agreed upon the following edits:

                           Dr. Chase moved, and Dr. Warner seconded, that the Board move this item from Information (as 
                           Item 12.01) to Action (as Item 11.05). The motion passed by a vote of six ayes and no nays.  
                           Ms. Yeung was unable to cast a vote due to technical difficulties. 
                           Dr. Warner moved, and Dr. Chase seconded, that the Board adopt the proposed resolution for the 
                           formation of a one-year ad hoc school transportation advisory committee with the edits listed 
                           above. The motion passed by a vote of six ayes and no nays. Ms. Yeung was unable to cast a 
                           vote due to technical difficulties. 
                   11.06  Award of a Delivery Order to Blue Bird Bus Sales of Virginia, Using Budgeted FY22 Annual 
                           Operating Funds in the Amount of $973,051, for the Procurement of Five Mainstream School 
                           Buses and Four Special Needs School Buses 
                           Assistant Superintendent of Finance and Administration Chris Fulmer advised the Board that it 
                           would be to our benefit to complete the delivery order as soon as possible, as there are parts 
                           shortages in the school bus manufacturing sector just as there are in the regular automobile sector. 
                           It typically takes at least six months to receive a new bus after ordering it. The current 
                           manufacturing issues will likely extend that even further. 
                           Ms. Hazard asked for clarification about the pricing differences between the two vendors (Blue Bird 
                           Bus Sales and Sonny Merryman). Mr. Fulmer explained that some of the new buses will run on gas, 
                           while others will run on diesel, so the prices are slightly different. 
                           Dr. Chase moved, and Dr. Warner seconded, that the Board move this item from Information (as 
                           Item 12.04) to Action (as Item 11.06). The motion passed unanimously. 
                           Dr. Chase moved, and Dr. Warner seconded, that the Board award the proposed delivery order to 
                           Blue Bird Bus Sales of Virginia in the amount of $973,051 for the procurement of five mainstream 
                           buses and four special needs buses. The motion passed unanimously. 
                   11.07  Award of a Delivery Order to Sonny Merryman, Inc., Using Budgeted FY22 Annual Operating 
                           Funds in the Amount of $344,515, for the Procurement of Two Mainstream School Buses and One 
                           Special Needs School Bus 
                           This matter was discussed simultaneously with Item 11.06. 
                           Dr. Chase moved, and Dr. Warner seconded, that the Board move this item from Information (as

              12. INFORMATION ITEMS 
                  These items were brought to the Board for a <first reading= and discussion today. Unless otherwise 
                  indicated, the items will be brought back to the Board for action on September 28, 2021. 
                  12.01  Adoption of a Resolution for the Formation of a One-Year Ad Hoc Transportation Advisory 
                         Committee 
                         This item was moved to Action. (See Item 11.05.) 
                  12.02  Discussion Regarding the Stafford County Planning Commission’s Possible Recommendation to 
                         Modify the Urban Services Area Boundary in the Vicinity of the Clift Farm School Property Owned 
                         by the School Division 
                         Executive Director of Facilities and Operations John Anderson provided a draft map of the Clift Farm 
                         Project Future Land Use and explained there has been a request for the County to remove an area 
                         from the urban services area (<USA=) which includes our Clift Farm property. He advised the Board 
                         that it would not be to our advantage for the land to be removed from the USA. School division 
                         staff has notified County staff of our opposition to the plan. Mr. Anderson stated, however, that if 
                         the land is removed from the USA, it could be put back if and when we are ready to build on the 
                         site. He explained that although the property is not suitable for any of the projects that are in our 
                         current 10-year capital improvement plan, the land could be suitable for something further into the 
                         future. 
                         Dr. Chase reported that she has spoken with a number of residents in that area and some of them 
                         have concerns about the nearby Filippo Farm property being rezoned and turned into a 55+ 
                         community. Dr. Chase also stated that she hopes the Clift Farm property can remain in the USA. 
                         Ms. Hollerback stated she is curious to know the intent behind the push to remove the property 
                         from the USA, and she wonders how doing so could aid the County’s efforts to control urban 
                         sprawl. 
                         Ms. Hazard stated that she does not want to make any decision that would make the Clift Farm 
                         property any less marketable. 
                  12.03  Approval of the Name and Dedication of an Outdoor Classroom at Widewater Elementary School 
                         for Dr. Scott R. Kizner 
                         This item was moved to Action. (See Item 11.01.)

                         Buses and Four Special Needs School Buses
