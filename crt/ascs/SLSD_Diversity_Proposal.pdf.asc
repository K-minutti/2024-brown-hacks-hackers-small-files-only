       PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT SERVICES 
        
       Objective 
       To provide professional development to Southern Lehigh School District (SLSD) staff and administration regarding 
       concepts related to human diversity, racial equity, social justice, and equitable education policies and practices. To 
       assist SLSD staff and administration in understanding the historical context of race and racism in education and 
       how it connects to current events. To assist staff in developing culturally relevant/sustaining pedagogical practices.  
       Goals 
       In education, gaps and disparities in discipline data and academic outcomes continue to persist between students 
       of color and their white counterparts. Education, as a social system, is fraught with a history of systematically 
       underserving, or, in some cases overtly oppressing, students of color and other marginalized identities (bell, 1995). 
       Current research suggests that, in order to eliminate these disparities, students of color and other marginalized 
       identities must have their unique socio-cultural needs met (Ladson-Billings, 1995). One manner of meeting these 
       needs is for educators to develop culturally relevant/sustaining pedagogical practices (Paris, 2012). The primary 
       goal of this training program is to assist SLSD staff and administration in developing these culturally 
       relevant/sustaining pedagogical practices. Upon completion, participants in this training program should be able 
       to: 
        "  Define and understand terminology such as race, racism, systematic oppression, marginalization, implicit 
         bias, prejudice, discrimination, etc.  
        "  Understand the role of socialization in the development of implicit bias 
        "  Understand racial identity development 
        "  Understand the history of racism and social injustice within the system of education and how it relates to 
         contemporary classrooms 
        "  Understand the unique socio-cultural needs of various student ethnic and racial groups 
        "  Understand, develop, and practice culturally relevant/sustaining pedagogical practices 
       Training Outline 
       The proposed Diversity, Inclusion, and Equity Training Program will be comprised of 5 modules. Modules can be 
       delivered asynchronously (as an online course via Canvas or any other online student management program), 
       synchronously (live, on-line sessions), face-to-face (in-person sessions), or as a hybrid model. Modules may 
       require participants to read various text (academic articles, national data reports, selected readings from books), 
       view publicly accessible documentaries or films, and complete assignments to demonstrate mastery of the

       Needs Assessment 
       A needs assessment can be conducted on behalf of SLSD to analyze and inform a 3-year, district-wide action 
       plan that specifically address issues of diversity, inclusion, and equity. The needs assessment will consist of three 
       components: 
        "  An analysis of discipline data from the last five years 
        "  An analysis of academic data from the last five years 
        "  One of two district wide survey options: either a) a climate survey for all staff and students regarding their 
         perceptions, dispositions, and concerns related to diversity, equity, and inclusion, or b) a survey for all 
         teaching staff to determine their self-reported self efficacy regarding culturally responsive teaching 
        
       Regarding discipline and academic data, a statistical analysis can be conducted to determine which of five primary 
       factors (race, gender, time, grade level, and school) is the most significant predictor of outcomes in both 
       categories (discipline rates and academic performance). Regarding the district wide survey, data analysis will be 
       determined by which survey option is chosen.  
        
       Data collected from the needs assessment will be used to generate recommendations that will be presented to 
       SLSD administration in the form of a 3-year action plan (see below).  
       Action Plan 
       A 3-year diversity, inclusion, and equity action plan will be generated for SLSD administration based on the data 
       generated in the needs assessment. This action plan can include, but is not limited to, the following: 
        "  Identification of targeted areas of improvement (schools, grade levels, content areas) 
        "  Recommendations regarding how to narrow gaps and minimize discrepancies in discipline data and 
         academic outcomes, particularly as it relates to race 
        "  Recommendations regarding district-wide professional development related to diversity, equity, and inclusion 
        "  Recommendations regarding the development of student initiatives associated with diversity, inclusion, and 
         equity across all grade levels 
        "  Recommendations regarding community partnerships and engagement opportunities as it relates to SLSD 
         diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives
