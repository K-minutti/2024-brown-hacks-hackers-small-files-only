        Prior to roll call, Mrs. Kresge expressed concern about Addendum item #14.C. and requested 
        that an update be provided as to everything that is being done in order to make things better 
        than last year with Cyber School. Dr. Brennan stated that she is aware of the issues that 
        occurred last year and is working closely with Mr. Tomori who is also in communication with 
        VLN to, among other things, determine the initial licenses that we need. Dr. Brennan said that 
        there are 144 currently enrolled in PVCA and Mr. Tomori is communicating with VLN with regard 
        to additional enrollments, if needed. Dr. Brennan stated that the numbers are down compared

        Mrs. Yozwiak referred to the 17 individuals who resigned from the district and thanked them for 
        their dedication and wished them the best of luck. 
         
        Dr. Brennan stated that it has been difficult to reach parents whose children enrolled in outside 
        cyber school and/or home school. She said that in order to insure that we can plan for all 
        children, we are sending out a letter certified mail, return receipt requested, to families asking 
        them to let us know by August 4th whether or not they will be returning to brick and mortar. Dr. 
        Brennan will also send out a Connect Ed call to the families.

        John  Hines,  Polk  Township,  expressed  his  opinion  against  mask  wearing  and  requested  a 
        reference that supports the federally mandated mask wearing on school buses. Solicitor Mark 
        Fitzgerald outlined the specific order that the CDC put out in January concerning mask wearing 
        on all public transportation including school buses and although there is some debate as to the 
        CDC’s  authority,  PDE  has  interpreted  the  order  as  a  requirement.  He  also  addressed  the 
        obligation of outsourced services.

        Maryellen Altman, Chestnuthill Township, questioned the implementation of CRT. Dr. Brennan

        District will be implementing with no changes.

        Carlos Lizardi, Jr., Chestnuthill Township, read a letter from a teacher regarding critical race 
        theory.
