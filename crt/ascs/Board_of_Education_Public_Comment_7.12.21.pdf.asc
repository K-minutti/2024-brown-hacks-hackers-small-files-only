                                                     You have local control. Kids have not been wearing masks all summer. They’re hanging out, having 
                                                     sleepovers, playing sports, etc. 
                                                      
                                                     Any teacher or adult who works in a school building who wants a vaccine has had an opportunity to get it.  
                                                      
                                                     Therefore take the masks off the kids, make it optional, and let’s let the school system align with the rest of 
                                                     the state and move forward.  
                                                      
                                                     If you do not do so, it will be clear as day that you are putting the needs of the adults ahead of the needs of 
                                                     kids. And that would be a pathetic display from a school board in the city which has been rated the ‘#1 place

                                                     I appreciate all the hard work that you have done this past year to ensure that our students were able to 
                                                     safely attend school in person or online. Due to the CDC’s recent shift in guidance, I realize that the district 
                                                     will be looking to change some policies.  
                                                      
                                                     The Communicable Disease Prevention Act (410ILCS315/) discusses various diseases that can have “serious 
                                                     threats to the health of the community”. As we have seen, COVID-19 is most definitely a disease that is a 
                                                     serious thereat to our community. While vaccination against SARS-COV2 is not yet required under this act, it 
                                                     does provide for the vaccination of other diseases in the community. Under Illinois Public Act 097-0910, a 
                                                     student’s is required to “present to the local school proof of having received such immunizations against 
                                                     preventable communicable diseases.” Therefore, it is not an undue burden, nor request, that any student, 
                                                     faculty, or staff member who would like to be maskless in school buildings provide their proof of vaccination 
                                                     to the school before being allowed to unmask. This will allow those who are fully vaccinated to remove their 
                                                     masks while maintaining trust in the community. 
                                                      
                                                     Thank you,

                                                     I strongly urge district 203 to make masks optional in the fall, regardless of vaccination status. For teachers 
                                                     and students who are vaccinated, they should not be concerned about those who do not wear masks. That is 
                                                     the point of getting vaccinated. If I choose not to vaccinate my child, the concern lies solely with me. Data 
                                                     shows that children are a low risk population, but if anyone is still concerned then they can choose to wear a 
                                                     mask. There is no scientific need to require masks at this stage.

                                                     With vaccination not yet available for elementary students (age 11 and under) it is imperative to continue 
                                                     wearing masks AND to also offer remote learning. The increased spread of the Delta variant reinforces this 
                                                     need.  
                                                      
                                                     An additional benefit for continued mask wearing is that it will help reduce the spread of cold, flu, strep 
                                                     throat, etc. 
                                                      
                                                     If the District chooses to forgo masks for vaccinated children (age 12 and older), I want to know how 
                                                     specifically the District will verify the vaccination status of these children. I think proof of vaccination is 
                                                     mandatory.

                                                     I am writing in to share my family’s concern about mandatory masks for children. 
                                                      
                                                     One of the reasons we moved to Naperville was for the great schools, but due to the threat of mandatory 
                                                     masks and other politicized health-related guidelines, we have had to find an alternative private school 
                                                     option for our soon-to-be first grader right now.  
                                                      
                                                     The facts and science surrounding covid and children have not changed. Children overall have been and 
                                                     continue to be unaffected by this virus. Children who do get it have very mild symptoms, if any. There are 
                                                     unfortunately rare cases of immune-deficient children who get more seriously ill, but this is not unlike any 
                                                     other disease, including a regular coronavirus(cold).  
                                                      
                                                     Each year millions of kids come down with the annual influenza virus. Some children get so sick with 
                                                     influenza they lose their life to it. There were 192 pediatric deaths associated with influenza during the 2019-
                                                     2020 flu season, according to the CDC. This is sadly something that occurs every year, yet our kids have been 
                                                     able to attend school normally without enforced masks or other social distancing measures.  
                                                      
                                                     I know there is a strong and passionate argument that children need to be masked to “protect others”. But, 
                                                     the truth is we have always had vulnerable and immune-deficient populations who are more susceptible to 
                                                     illness. As someone who is immune deficient myself and faced serious illness, I would never put the 
                                                     responsibility of my health on my child or ANYONE else for that matter. My health is my responsibility,

      period. We cannot put this burden on our children. Especially when children can’t even properly wear masks 
      for them to be medically beneficial anyways. 
       
      Masking our kids isn’t how we can combat illness or better protect our health. Changes in lifestyle, diet and 
      mindset is how we better arm our bodies and immune systems against a virus.  
       
      Masks have created physical health issues and psychological trauma for many children over the last year. 
      They have been a hinderance to their learning, socialization and well-being. 
       
      Unfortunately masks have been politicized. If you travel to other states you will not see adults or children 
      wearing masks at anywhere near the same rate as here in Illinois, yet they are not experiencing increased 
      covid cases or deaths across state lines.  
       
      There has always been and will always be threats facing our safety and health. That is the reality of life. 
      Nothing has changed with that. What has changed is people’s perspective. Our society is now making 
      decisions out of fear, what if’s, and political agendas, rather than utilizing facts and discernment.  
       
      When a life threat is statistically under one percent, parents should be the authority figure making decisions 
      for their own child. Children (and most parents of school-aged children) have the same chance of dying from 
      covid as they do in a car crash...under one percent. Yet, most of us get in our cars to drive our children to 
      school each day, and that is our right to continue to make that decision.  
       
      After all, as parents it is our number one job to decide what’s best for our kids—which is why mask wearing 
      should be optional and up to each family.  
       
      Covid is no longer the biggest threat. Fear has become the biggest threat against our children. Mandatory 
      masks are definitely not the solution.

                                                     I appreciate all the efforts that the district leadership is taking to provide the best possible education to the 
                                                     students. Thank you! 
                                                     I want my kids to learn the actual history of this country. In elementary read aloud should include books like 
                                                     Loretta Little Looks Back: Three Voices Go Tell It. Also, I think representation is very very important. It 
                                                     shouldn't just be the social media public posts by district, schools and teachers, the students should feel it. 
                                                     Reading a book based on a particular holiday and then doing the regular reading lesson is also not enough. 
                                                     'Read Aloud' should be made the major method to do this. That way students won't be taught 'racism' and 
                                                     'representation', they will have a chance to think about it, absorb it and embrace it.

                                                     Since August 1, 2020, just 4 Naperville kids ages 10-19 were hospitalized for COVID. That is out of nearly 500 
                                                     COVID-related hospitalizations of Naperville residents, in the same period. None of the hospitalizations were 
                                                     of kids under the age of 10. 
                                                      
                                                     ****** AT LEAST IN NAPERVILLE, OUR KIDS AREN’T DRIVING COVID SPREAD. IN NAPERVILLE, KIDS AREN’T At 
                                                     SIGNIFICANT RISK OF SERIOUS COVID DISEASE. ****** 
                                                      
                                                     ISBE & CDC say decisions can & should be made locally. It is time for District 203 to let parents make the 
                                                     decision for their own children whether to mask them or not. There are many parents who are not 
                                                     comfortable with giving their children a vaccine that is not FDA approved and only approved for emergency 
                                                     use. To push this and then allow those vaccinated to unmask is a wrong. The district has never before 
                                                     required unvaccinated children (childhood vaccines such as MMR, polio, etc) to wear masks and those are 
                                                     FDA approved vaccines. It’s time to end this hypocrisy.  
                                                      
                                                     This is also an OSHA violation for the amount of carbon dioxide our children are forced to breathe. Will the 
                                                     district take on that liability when a child gets injured from wearing a mask?? 
                                                      
                                                     Those who are unvaccinated and required to wear a mask will be ridiculed and bullied by other students 
                                                     because it will be blatantly obvious who has chosen not to get an EUA shot. I cannot believe the district 
                                                     would allow this as my child’s medical information is private.  
                                                      
                                                     This is a parental choice and not the districts to push! End the nonsense and make masks optional!!!

                                                     This follows what the science says and I understand that. But please require proof of vaccination in order to

                                                     on this district, this seems the perfect way to reinforce the message of helping others.

                                                     I thank you so very much for your hard work during the most challenging year of our children’s lives. My son 
                                                     will be going into 3rd grade this year. He is sensitive and sweet and loves making new friends. He adores his 
                                                     teacher and truly went above and beyond to make this past school year a positive experience. That being 
                                                     said, he deeply misses the connection he once had with his peers before masks in school ever existed. Please 
                                                     make masks optional for our children. Give parents the choice. Give our children the best experience 
                                                     possible. Let them see their fellow classmates smile, grimace, laugh, ponder, think, and explore. A smile is 
                                                     worth so much more than words. 
                                                     Thank you for your consideration.

                                                     Hi, 
                                                      
                                                     I would like to request the 203 School District to survey parents regarding masking students during the 2021-
                                                     22 school year.  
                                                      
                                                     I have had so many parents share w/ me this summer that they would like to see schools head back to some 
                                                     sort of normalcy this year, and masking seems to be one of their biggest concerns.  
                                                      
                                                     This weekend I opened a google form doc to survey my small area of influence (friends and neighbors, etc) 
                                                     and within 48 hours received over 500 responses of parents wishing for a mask-optional learning 
                                                     environment for their child.  
                                                      
                                                     The obvious limitations of this survery include the length of time available for response, the fact that I am 
                                                     not a native to Naperville and only have children in elementary schools. But there are parents listed from 
                                                     every school in the district.  
                                                      
                                                     I ask you to consider creating your own district wide survey on this matter.

                                                     Although you are hearing a lot from a vocal group, there is a silent majority that has politely given you a 
                                                     chance to breathe and determine how best to safely open our schools now that the CDC has issued their 
                                                     guidance on mask wearing. We all have a responsibility and the ability to end this public health crisis by 
                                                     either wearing a mask or getting a vaccine; these are simple safety measures that can protect ourselves, as 
                                                     well as the many others that have selflessly worked throughout this pandemic. Vaccinating against 
                                                     communicable diseases is not new; public schools have required them for many years. Until the FDA fully 
                                                     approves the mRNA vaccines, mask wearing is the temporary solution. 
                                                     Appeasing the partisan whims of a vocal interest group with regards to public health, as well as the teaching 
                                                     of concepts related to diversity could most certainly lead to unintended consequences.

                                                     Original Message: 
                                                     First of all, I would like to thank Superintendent Bridges for advocating with state agencies to allow local 
                                                     school boards to decide covid policies for their districts. Your advocacy worked and both Illinois Department 
                                                     of Public Health and the State Board of Education have agreed to allow districts the flexibility to set policies 
                                                     with respect to covid.  
                                                      
                                                     We can debate all day about whether masks actually work to reduce the transmission of an aerosolized virus. 
                                                     However, no one knows with any degree of certainty because the proper Randomized control trial studies 
                                                     have not been done. For 16 months, we have forced children to mask without even knowing if there is a 
                                                     benefit that outweighs the risks. Masking is not a benign intervention. We know that masking can negatively 
                                                     impact speech. We know the masks get dirty and moist and filled with bacteria after even short periods of 
                                                     time, let alone 8 plus hours. We know that masking hinders communication between students and between 
                                                     students and teachers. We know that Facial expressions matter. Only 7% of what we communicate is done 
                                                     through actual words. The other 93% is communicated through facial expressions, body language and tone. 
                                                     You cannot remove facial expressions and expect no negative impact on communication. Yet, we are forcing 
                                                     kids to do this with no evidence or data to back it up. 
                                                      
                                                     But, the most important thing to consider is that the risk of severe disease or death from covid in children is 
                                                     extremely low, on par or lower than what we would see in a typical flu season. Per the CDC, the infection 
                                                     fatality rate for 0-17 year olds is less than .0002%.

      In contrast, Following are some of the death rates for children 5 to 14 years old per the CDC: 
      Vehicle Accidents: 1.9 per 100,000 
      Suicide: 1.5 per 100,000 
      Drowning: .5 per 100,000 
      Flu and pneumonia: .3 per 100,000 
      Covid: .2 per 100,000 
       
      From April 2009 to April 2010, almost 1300 children died of H1N1 and there was no call for masking or 
      closing schools or any interventions at all. In almost every recent flu season, more children have died of the 
      flu than have died from covid. In life, we accept some level risk in everything we do. My husband and I allow 
      our teenage daughters to drive knowing that there is a small risk that they may be seriously injured or die. 
      We allow our children to swim knowing there is a small risk they may drown. As adults, we must start 
      modeling RATIONAL risk assessment and allow our children to return fully to normal lives and normal school. 
      We have put the burden of this disease on our children for far too long and we know we have done great 
      damage to them emotionally, socially, and academically. We put their needs last when we should have put 
      them first.  
       
      We are going to live with endemic covid for many years to come. Some parents will decide to vaccinate their 
      children, some will decide against it. Medical interventions that have no solid evidence they are 
      necessary…including masking and vaccinating healthy children should never be forced. Only parents are in a 
      position to make medical decisions for their children. I’m asking you to please return that responsibility to 
      parents and allow masking to be optional for all children in the upcoming school year.  
       
      Thank you!

                                                     versus not vaccinated- this is a topic our children should not be asked to explain at this time. Personally, I 
                                                     would like to see research done on children before I subject my child to a new medical procedure and the 
                                                     schools should be looking for this data as well before asking parents to potentially harm their childs health. 
                                                     Please lets let families decide what is best for themselves individually like many other places in the country 
                                                     are doing. We pay alot of money in school taxes here, I would like our concerns to be considered.

                                                     My name is Karen Peck. My children went to Naperville schools. I remain a taxpaying member of the 
                                                     community.  
                                                      
                                                     My hero is the late Representative John Lewis. He said, “When you see something that is not right, not fair, 
                                                     not just, / you have to speak up. You have to say something; you have to do something.”  
                                                      
                                                     That’s why I’m here. The bullying at these meetings is appalling. And it’s part of a national, concerted 
                                                     strategy, fostered by think tanks, politicians, and shock pundits to falsely redefine concepts and push lies. 
                                                     /Nationwide./ Critical Race Theory is conflated with Culturally Responsive Teaching and rolled up with 
                                                     buzzwords like indoctrination, ‘social wokeism’, and calling the study of racism, racist. This is propaganda. 
                                                     /Critical Race Theory is not taught in K-12. / It is scholarly study in law school.

      Here’s a stunning fact I learned from Isabelle Wilkerson’s book Caste. The Nazis studied American slavery to 
      address the “Jewish Problem.” Think about that for a minute. / One of the worst atrocities in human history 
      was based on the success of American enslavement of other humans. / We must not silence this truth or its 
      lingering effects.  
      In Germany, school children learn about the atrocities of their county’s past in order not to repeat those 
      horrors in the future. German children do not break from guilt. They grow in empathy and compassion. Why 
      would parents want to oppose the opportunity for a more compassionate and empathetic child?  
      I have faith that our young people will make the world a better, more compassionate place. I am grateful 
      that our elected school board understands this, and I fully support our Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion 
      teaching.  
       
      Thank you.

                                                     I’m writing to you about my concerns about two issues a vocal minority is pressing: 1) school requirements 
                                                     for the unvaccinated and 2) seeking the elimination or whitewashing of Diversity, Equity & Inclusion (DE&I) in 
                                                     the curriculum for K-12. 
                                                      
                                                     I appreciate that D203 is waiting for complete updated guidance, including ISBE, and only then will decisions 
                                                     be made on policy. Assuming ISBE concurs with the CDC or is silent on mask wearing, I encourage you to 
                                                     adopt the CDC’s guidance: 1) masks optional for the vaccinated and 2) masks required for the unvaccinated. 
                                                     Demanding no masks, no conditions is advocating for the individual over the community/common good. We 
                                                     know that we have not achieved herd immunity. We know that masks work. We know that there is a virulent 
                                                     strain called the Delta variant that is more contagious. We know that if we work together we can maximize 
                                                     our children’s education and experience under strained conditions. There is an option for parents who have 
                                                     children who are too young to be vaccinated or don’t want their children vaccinated at all AND they do not 
                                                     want to follow mask guidance: home school or enroll in a private school without the requirement. Otherwise 
                                                     mask up.  
                                                      
                                                     Secondly, there are certain newly formed local groups decrying Critical Race Theory, a course of study and 
                                                     examination that is conducted in law schools and graduate schools. CRT is not taught in K-12 education. 
                                                     These complaints are a mask (ironic, right?) for their opposition to DE&I incorporated in K-12 curriculum. 
                                                     They suggest that by teaching and discussing US history with eyes wide open to well documented racial 
                                                     injustices that the schools are “dividing” students and promoting racism. In reality, if the district accedes to

                                                     As a District 203 parent, I fully support the school board and administration requiring masks to be worn by 
                                                     students and staff this fall who cannot prove that they have been fully vaccinated against Covid. 
                                                      
                                                     I would also strongly support a policy in District 203 where Covid vaccinations are a requirement for 
                                                     attendance, employment, and volunteering at 203 schools, for everyone who is eligible to receive the 
                                                     vaccine.  
                                                      
                                                     To do anything less than one of these options is reckless and ignores the science and facts about the Delta 
                                                     variant and its spread among unvaccinated populations.  
                                                      
                                                     Fear mongering, conspiracy theories, and political agendas being promoted by a malcontented minority in 
                                                     our community and outside it—whose candidates for school board were resoundingly defeated in the last 
                                                     election—are no match against sound policy meant to protect the health and safety of our students and 
                                                     staff.  
                                                      
                                                     Stay strong and stay true to the mission of our school district.

                                                     I would like to comment and urge District 203 to consider the new guidance issued by the CDC in regard to 
                                                     COVID-19 specifically addressing the mask mandate. District 203 should align with Phase 5 guidance which 
                                                     no longer requires its students to wear a mask, other than for public transportation, i.e. buses. As a parent of 
                                                     an early education student, I have seen first hand how masks are detrimental to the growth and the learning 
                                                     ability especially when it comes to reading. I would also be interested in seeing scientific research/studies on 
                                                     the effects of children wearing masks for a prolonged period of time and while engaging in strenuous 
                                                     activities, i.e. gym class/recess. I urge you to be an advocate for our children and not act selfishly or only in 
                                                     the best interest of yourself. It's not about you...it's about our children and giving them all the tools they 
                                                     require to foster the best chance to learn and a fair education.

                                                     From your FOIA release, you apparently believe you cannot show or tell us the content based on wording in 
                                                     the speaker's contract about proprietary intellectual property rights and confidentiality.  
                                                      
                                                     I understand why competitive businesses may want to require secrecy in contracts, and that a FOIA response 
                                                     might not be able to include "trade secrets" as defined in the trade secret laws. However, "trade secrets" are 
                                                     narrowly defined and would not include training session information provided to a public school system and 
                                                     given to teachers. The only truly applicable intellectual property interest would be "copyrights." Yet 
                                                     copyrights are automatically protected by law without the need for confidentiality clauses. A court might 
                                                     even rule that this confidentiality clause is invalid as surplus wording which also exceeds the board's

                                                     So it seems that the confidentiality clause in the contract may have been included perhaps as routine "legal 
                                                     boilerplate" - not actually necessary to protect intellectual property rights. I ask that the board please make a 
                                                     diligent good faith effort to seek the speaker's consent to the disclosure of the materials to the public per the 
                                                     FOIA request. I ask that the board's representative seek to explain to the speaker that a number of parents 
                                                     expressed concerns and may assume the worst about the materials if they are not disclosed.

      representative should pass along the points I've made about the copyright laws already protecting the 
      intellectual property interests regardless of publication. 
       
      Going forward, I ask that the board refrain from including confidentiality clauses in contracts absent an 
      actual legally sufficient concern about a valid trade secret, e.g. the secret recipe for Coke. In this case in 
      particular, I fail to understand why a school district would sign a contract that even purports to require 
      secrecy when there are plenty of speakers out there who already have recorded quality training material. 
      Some of it is free, some you might have to pay for, but I see no reason to buy material that the public is not 
      permitted to see. The current policy lacks transparency and generates suspicion. 
       
      In summary, can you tell us whether you will agree to my two requests: (A) a diligent good faith effort to 
      seek the speaker's consent to the disclosure of the materials, and (B) discontinue the policy of permitting our 
      school district to purchase teacher training content that is subject to confidentiality restrictions?

                                                     Original Message: 
                                                     I would like to thank the board for keeping student and staff health and safety front of mind during this 
                                                     pandemic. I am urging the board to continue to follow the CDC guidance and continue requiring masks at the 
                                                     start of the 2021/22 school year. This will help those in our community who are unable to be vaccinated as 
                                                     well as those with weakened immune responses. The hope will be to continue to keep numbers low so more 
                                                     restrictive measures will not be needed, ensuring consistency for our children. I know many others have 
                                                     provided the statistics to support masking, but as the parent of a neuro-divergent child, I would love to see a 
                                                     stable and consistent learning environment for him. He is comfortable and used to masking. He understands 
                                                     that masks allow us to be able to do more until the pandemic ends. Prematurely throwing out public health 
                                                     measures could send us back to a lockdown, causing more stress and chaos for all children, and it would be 
                                                     devastating for those children that have difficulty adapting to change. Thank you for considering what is best

                                                     including the school mask requirement, until a vaccine is approved and available for pre-k and elementary

                                                     Some parents are vaccine hesitant, concerned about potential long term effects from the shots. I am 
                                                     personally worried about potential long term health consequences for children who contract COVID. Until 
                                                     vaccines are approved for younger children, universal mask wearing in classrooms is my child’s best 
                                                     protection .  
                                                      
                                                     Some people are inclined to compare COVID infection in children to the flu. However, with the flu, we have a 
                                                     CHOICE as parents to seasonally vaccinate our children, which can at least decrease the severity of illness 
                                                     should they contract it. Whereas parents will not have the choice to provide their young children with similar 
                                                     protection against COVID-19 until several weeks or months after the start of the school year. Do we really 
                                                     want to risk an entire classroom of children not just quarantined as a precaution, but actually INFECTED and

                                                     around the corner? 
                                                      
                                                     Please continue to mandate common sense mitigation measures, including masks, for just a *little* while

                                                     Thank you to the board for all of your hard work. My children (3 kids in 3 schools in 203) spent all of last year 
                                                     remote because my son is immunocompromised. Please follow masking guidelines from the cdc and make 
                                                     masks mandatory for kids and make proof of vaccination mandatory for staff and students who claim to be 
                                                     vaccinated. It’s not a violation of rights, but does cost sick kids and their siblings to live in fear and risk their 
                                                     health to be in school to learn. My kids are so excited to come back to school. Please make proof of 
                                                     vaccination of Covid an essential part of the process to be in school. Thank you. There is a loud group of 
                                                     parents who want to make masks optional. Please don’t put the rest of us at risk bc of their lack of

                                                     When the 21-22 school year begins, masks should be optional for students and staff. This mask optional 
                                                     policy should be in place for ALL.  
                                                      
                                                     Thank you,
