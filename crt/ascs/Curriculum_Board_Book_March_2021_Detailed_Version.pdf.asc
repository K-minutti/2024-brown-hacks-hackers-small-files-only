                              BACKGROUND: The curriculum process at Cabrillo is robust and ongoing in response to changes in student needs, industry, technology, and state compliance requirements. Each primary semester, all curriculum 
                              proposals submitted by faculty are reviewed and approved by the Curriculum Committee, Faculty Senate, and the Vice President of Instruction. Preceding implementation and final authorization by the State 
                              Chancellor’s Office, approval is required by our Governing Board. The attached proposals represent those approved during the Spring 2021 curriculum cycle. The proposed implementation date is Fall 2021 for all 
                              proposals except for those which need Chancellor’s Office approval. Any proposals requiring Chancellor’s Office approval will be implemented after that approval is received.

         Title 5 and section 508 require that distance education complies with the Americans with Disabilities Act. To ensure
         success for all students, course content must be designed and maintained to ensure it is ADA and section 508 and section
         504 compliant. Please indicate that your course will meet the following requirements:
            Videos will be accurately captioned
            Audio files will be transcribed
            Objects (including images, tables, and charts) will have alternative text
            Course materials will be readable in terms of font, color contrast, and spacing. Color is not the only method used to convey meaning
            Hyperlink text will be meaningful
            Documents will be created in such a way that screen reading software can read them (i.e. styles are used, column header rows in tables
            are specified, etc.)
         One of the primary concepts of distance education is to offer students learning anytime, anywhere. This means all DE
         courses and resources must be designed to give students with disabilities the opportunity to access distance education
         resources without the need for outside assistance, with built-in accommodation. With this in mind, is there any aspect of
         this course that cannot be made accessible to students with disabilities?
         No
         If yes, please explain how you may address these issues:
         N/A
         All course outcomes identified in the course outline of record must be met in the distance learning environment. If this
         course is presented via distance education, would any of the following pose challenges to meeting the required course
         outcomes:

          Title 5 and section 508 require that distance education complies with the Americans with Disabilities Act. To ensure
          success for all students, course content must be designed and maintained to ensure it is ADA and section 508 and section
          504 compliant. Please indicate that your course will meet the following requirements:
            Videos will be accurately captioned
            Audio files will be transcribed
            Objects (including images, tables, and charts) will have alternative text
            Course materials will be readable in terms of font, color contrast, and spacing. Color is not the only method used to convey meaning
            Hyperlink text will be meaningful
            Documents will be created in such a way that screen reading software can read them (i.e. styles are used, column header rows in tables
            are specified, etc.)
          One of the primary concepts of distance education is to offer students learning anytime, anywhere. This means all DE
          courses and resources must be designed to give students with disabilities the opportunity to access distance education
          resources without the need for outside assistance, with built-in accommodation. With this in mind, is there any aspect of
          this course that cannot be made accessible to students with disabilities?
          No
          If yes, please explain how you may address these issues:
          N/A
          All course outcomes identified in the course outline of record must be met in the distance learning environment. If this
          course is presented via distance education, would any of the following pose challenges to meeting the required course

                                                            shifts the focus from physical infrastructre to cloud infrastructure. Understanding cloud services
                                                            will be of enormous and growing benefit to CIS students. The new transferrable course will be an

         Title 5 and section 508 require that distance education complies with the Americans with Disabilities Act. To ensure
         success for all students, course content must be designed and maintained to ensure it is ADA and section 508 and section
         504 compliant. Please indicate that your course will meet the following requirements:
            Videos will be accurately captioned
            Audio files will be transcribed
            Objects (including images, tables, and charts) will have alternative text
            Course materials will be readable in terms of font, color contrast, and spacing. Color is not the only method used to convey meaning
            Hyperlink text will be meaningful
            Documents will be created in such a way that screen reading software can read them (i.e. styles are used, column header rows in tables
            are specified, etc.)
         One of the primary concepts of distance education is to offer students learning anytime, anywhere. This means all DE
         courses and resources must be designed to give students with disabilities the opportunity to access distance education
         resources without the need for outside assistance, with built-in accommodation. With this in mind, is there any aspect of
         this course that cannot be made accessible to students with disabilities?

          this course that cannot be made accessible to students with disabilities?

         white supremacy, self-determination, liberation, decolonization and anti-racism while identifying a number of the major writers of Native America,
         including their themes, styles and objectives.
         2. Apply theory to describe critical events in the histories, cultures and intellectual traditions, with special focus on the lived-experiences and social

         Course Outline
               1. Regional variation and geographic diversity with attention to Oklahoma (Indian Territory), Minnesota and the Great Lakes, the
                 Dakotas, California, and other significant geographical regions, including the broader relationships across North America spanning
                 over a two hundred year period, as well as interactions between these regions over that time span. Impacts of racialization and
                 eurocentrism upon economic and political structures, and upon both specific and general Native American population diasporas.
               2. Settler colonialism and Native American interaction with external regions and powers, from first contact with the Spanish, French,
                 and the English, through the formation of the United States. Aspects of settler colonialism and Native experiences such as forced
                 migrations, missions, trade, and violence. The nexus of Indigenous histories, cultural values and fundamental relationships to land
                                                                                                                                        …

                                                                                                                       Page 81 of 205
                 and life through intellectual traditions of both settlers and impacted Native cultures. The impact of interrupted long-term
                 relationships across new borders defined by settler colonialism both within and outside of the United States, with attention to
                 issues of agency and group-affirmation for Native American cultures.
               3. The California Mission system and its aftermath, from early Spanish times through the subsequent genocide under American rule,
                 an approximately one-hundred twenty-year period. The differences between Spanish colonialism and American colonialism and
                 the varying impacts on the California Indian population, including the San Francisco and Monterey Bay Area. California Indian
                 peoples within the lens of changing relationships to African American, Latinx, Asian communities, among others, and
                 contemporary concepts of ethnic studies, in the context of Civil War and post-Civil War social and political dynamics in the U.S.
               4. Early US Indian policies from the American Revolution to the Civil War, including treaties, early reservations, Indian Removal, and
                 forced assimilation programs. Indian removal policies by the U.S. Government in terms of economic, political, and philosophical
                 reasons underlying them, as well as impacts on tribal issues, such as Native self-definition, loss of agency and self-determination.
                 The removal movement under the lens of the notion of rule-of-law, including concepts of hierarchy and oppression, sovereignty
                 and legal subjugation. Discussion of what political, economic, and social movements within both settler state and Native American
                 Nations arose through these policies. Application of critical race theory to this analysis, notably in the genesis of eugenics theories
                 in alliance with blood-quantum policies imposed by the U.S. Government that benefitted US political structures while
                 simultaneously disrupting Indigenous political structures.
               5. The political structures of Native America from pre-contact through first-contact, into the mid-nineteenth century, including an
                 analysis of the impacts of settler-colonial political structures as outgrowths of pre-existing European political structures. The
                 emerging political exigencies of settler colonialism with the advent of American independence. Analysis of structures within and
                 between tribal entities and between them and state and federal structures, such as Dakota-U.S. relations predating the Civil War
                 and subsequent to the Civil War. Examination of these political changes within American and Native societies through the lens of
                 economics, race theory, class, and gender, with focus on how Native structures shift cultural methodologies under the weight of
                 externally-imposed patriarchal systems. Analysis of social movements arising from this change that struggle with self-
                 determination, liberation, decolonization, and anti-racism.
               6. The practices of Native American kinship in families and communities, with both human and non-human life from pre-contact,
                 early-contact and into early U.S. periods, including its impact upon individuals and specific tribal groups, as well as with
                 connections to diasporic movements, restorative justice efforts and Indigenous networks, all within the context of the continuity of
                 the American experience, and its derivation from other cultures, politically, economically, socially, and geographically. Pre-U.S.
                 kinship networks between Native and White women before, during, and after the U.S. policies and efforts to eliminate kinship
                 systems for the purposes of facilitating resource extraction and hegemony over Native American lands and social organizations.
                 Native kinship responses to these major social and ethnically-based forces. Kinship relations between tribal entities and social
                 movements today as outgrowths of ancestral forms of resistance, struggle, and cultural solidarity, as shown through early pan-
                 Indian movements, such as Pontiac’s Rebellion and the prophet Tenskwatawa. How kinship relations and their restoration provide
                 engagement with anti-racist practices and develop movements toward a just and equitable society within and beyond the
                 classroom.
               7. The intersection of Native American race and ethnicity with other forms of difference affected by hierarchy and oppression, such as
                 class, gender, sexuality, spirituality, national origin, immigration status, ability and age. Analysis of impacts of settler concepts of all
                 of these aspects of human categorizations on Native American societies as well. Specific American representations of Native
                 peoples’ practices regarding gender roles, sexual identity, mixing of race, holding a larger sense of community vs. borders, wealth-
                 leveling ceremonial practices, and spiritual expression, including its relationship to fundamental concepts of time and space,
                 science and social responsibility.

         Outline
         Course Outline
               1. Regional variation and geographic diversity with attention paid to Oklahoma (Indian Territory), Minnesota and the Great Lakes, the
                 Dakotas, North Carolina, Arizona, New Mexico, California, and other significant geographical regions, including the broader
                 relationships across North America focusing on events from the 20th century onward while accounting for the context of events
                 spanning over one hundred and seventy years (from the mid 19th century to the 21st century), as well as interactions between
                 these regions over that time span. Impacts of racialization and eurocentrism upon economic and political structures and upon
                 both specific and general Native American population diasporas.
               2. Settler colonialism and Native American interaction with external regions and powers, from 1850 to the present. Aspects of settler
                 colonialism and Native experiences such as forced migrations, reservations, resource extraction, and genocide. The nexus of
                 Indigenous histories, cultural values, and fundamental relationships to land and life through intellectual traditions of both settler
                                                                                                                                        …

                                                                                                                       Page 91 of 205
                 culture and impacted Native cultures. The impact of interrupted long-term relationships across new borders defined by settler
                 colonialism both within and outside of the United States, with attention to changing agency and group-affirmation.
               3. Native Americans in California in the post-Mission period and in the era of early California statehood by examining current
                 scholarship on genocide in early California State policies and practices. The California Indian experience from 1848 to the present,
                 including the <Apprentice System= of forced child labor, forced displacements and diaspora, federal and state recognition policies,
                 inter-tribal relations, relationships to local non-Native communities, and emerging social movements towards resistance against
                 colonial hegemony and towards self-determination. The San Francisco and Monterey Bay Area, including investigating local
                 contemporary Native communities and the complexity of their methodologies in forming resistance to American settler
                 colonialism in the present while maintaining their cultural values and identity. Examine of relationships toward California Indian
                 peoples within the lens of changing relationships to African American, Latinx, Asian communities, among others, and
                 contemporary concepts of ethnic studies. 
               4. US Indian policies from the 20th to 21st centuries, including contextual information about forced removal programs through the
                 late nineteenth century, the reservation system, and allotment in the late nineteenth century; the Indian New Deal in the 1930s,
                 termination policies in the mid 20th century, urban relocation of the 1950s, and significant Supreme Court and other federal court
                 decisions. A focus on Indian policies by the U.S. Government in terms of economic, political, and philosophical reasons underlying
                 them, as well as impacts on tribal issues, such as Native self-definition, loss of agency, and self-determination. US policy under the
                 lens of the notion of rule-of-law, including concepts of hierarchy and oppression, sovereignty, and legal subjugation. Examination
                 of what political, economic, and social movements within both settler state and Native American Nations arose through these
                 policies, including the rise of social movements such as the American Indian Movement, National Congress of American Indians,
                 the Society of American Indians, the American Indian Science and Engineering society, MMIW, and Standing Rock. Application of
                 critical race theory to this analysis, notably in the use of eugenics theories in alliance with blood-quantum policies imposed by the
                 U.S. Government that aided settler-colonial political structures.
               5. The political structures of Native America from the mid-nineteenth century to the 21st century, including an analysis of the impacts
                 of settler-colonial political structures as outgrowths of pre-existing European political structures. Include the legacy of political
                 exigencies of settler colonialism since the creation of the United States. Analysis of structures within and between tribal entities
                 and between them and state and federal structures, such as Dakota-U.S. relations subsequent to the Civil War. Examination of
                 these political changes within American and Native societies through the lens of economics, race theory, class, and gender, with
                 focus on how Native structures shift cultural methodologies under the weight of externally-imposed patriarchal systems. Social
                 movements arising from this change that struggle with self-determination, liberation, decolonization, and anti-racism. US policies
                 and practices in the late 20th century which were a direct result of Native American social movement activism, such as the Native
                 American Freedom of Religion Act of 1978, the Native American Grave Protection and Repatriation Act of 1990, the formation of
                 Native American studies departments in some universities, and the restructuring of the Bureau of Indian Affairs. 
               6. Practices of Native American kinship in families and communities, with both human and non-human life from the mid-nineteenth
                 century to the 21st century, including its impact upon individuals and specific tribal groups, as well as with connections to
                 diasporic movements, restorative justice efforts, and Indigenous networks, all within the context of the continuity of the American
                 experience and its derivation from other cultures, politically, economically, socially, and geographically. Include US efforts to
                 eliminate Indigenous kinship systems for the purpose of facilitating resource extraction and hegemony over Native American lands
                 and social organizations. Native kinship responses to major social and ethnically-based US forces that deny Native Americans
                 agency and representation; for example, the Lone Wolf v. Hitchcock (1903) Supreme Court Decision in which the US gave itself <full
                 plenary power= over all Native Nations, in effect declaring that it no longer had to fulfill any treaty obligation already made with
                 Native peoples. Kinship relations between and among tribal entities and social movements today as outgrowths of ancestral forms
                 of resistance, struggle, and cultural solidarity, as shown through early pan-Indian movements and Native and non-Native alliances.
                 Exploration of how Indigenous kinship relations and their restoration provide engagement with anti-racist practices and develop
                 movements toward a just and equitable society within and beyond the classroom.
               7. The intersection of Native American race and ethnicity with other forms of difference affected by hierarchy and oppression, such as
                 class, gender, sexuality, spirituality, national origin, immigration status, ability, and age. Analysis of impacts of settler concepts of all
                 of these aspects of human categorizations on Native American societies as well. Specific American representations of Native
                 peoples’ practices regarding gender roles, sexual identity, mixing of race, holding a larger sense of community vs. borders, wealth-
                 leveling ceremonial practices, and spiritual expression, including its relationship to fundamental concepts of time and space,
                 science, and social responsibility.

          One of the primary concepts of distance education is to offer students learning anytime, anywhere. This means all DE
          courses and resources must be designed to give students with disabilities the opportunity to access distance education
          resources without the need for outside assistance, with built-in accommodation. With this in mind, is there any aspect of
          this course that cannot be made accessible to students with disabilities?
          Yes
          If yes, please explain how you may address these issues:
          Students often need to read and interpret graphs and tables. Alt text for graphs and tables can defeat the purpose of a problem.
          Alternate arrangements will be made based on individual student needs.
          Guidance is needed for accurate and correct captioning for mathematical notation.
          All course outcomes identified in the course outline of record must be met in the distance learning environment. If this
          course is presented via distance education, would any of the following pose challenges to meeting the required course
          outcomes:
          No Value
          If other, please explain:
          No Value

          Title 5 and section 508 require that distance education complies with the Americans with Disabilities Act. To ensure
          success for all students, course content must be designed and maintained to ensure it is ADA and section 508 and section
          504 compliant. Please indicate that your course will meet the following requirements:
            Videos will be accurately captioned
            Audio files will be transcribed
            Objects (including images, tables, and charts) will have alternative text
            Course materials will be readable in terms of font, color contrast, and spacing. Color is not the only method used to convey meaning
            Hyperlink text will be meaningful
            Documents will be created in such a way that screen reading software can read them (i.e. styles are used, column header rows in tables
            are specified, etc.)
          One of the primary concepts of distance education is to offer students learning anytime, anywhere. This means all DE
          courses and resources must be designed to give students with disabilities the opportunity to access distance education
          resources without the need for outside assistance, with built-in accommodation. With this in mind, is there any aspect of
          this course that cannot be made accessible to students with disabilities?
          No
          If yes, please explain how you may address these issues:

          Course Objectives
          1. Apply principles of software engineering to design and develop moderately sized programs using procedural and object-oriented approaches.
          2. Use standard terminology to describe and explain fundamental data structures and abstract data types (ADTs) including lists, sorted list, stacks,
          queues, priority queues, sets, binary trees, binary search trees, heaps, tables, and graphs in terms of structure, client interface, implementation,
          efficiency, and typical usage.
          3. Select appropriate standard ADTs to use as building blocks in larger programs. Modify existing ADTs to add or alter functionality, and use them as
          building blocks for new ADTs.
          4. Recognize the need for new ADTs, and specify, design, code, test, debug, and document them in C++ or Java.
          5. Explain the difference between an ADT and an implementation of an ADT. Describe two or more alternative implementations of at least two standard
          ADTs.
          6. Analyze, compare, and contrast similar ADTs, ADT implementations, and other algorithms in terms of functionality, time and space-efficiency, ease of
          use, and ease of coding.
          7. Use recursion to implement simple numeric and non-numeric algorithms. Explain the necessary characteristics of a recursive solution, the trade offs
          between recursive and iterative solutions of the same algorithm. Write a simple recursive definition.
          8. Explain the prefix, infix, and postfix representations of arithmetic expressions, and convert one form to another.
          9. Describe the operation of several sorting advanced algorithms (including QuickSort and MergeSort) and choose the appropriate one for a given
          application.
                                                                                                                                                  …

          Title 5 and section 508 require that distance education complies with the Americans with Disabilities Act. To ensure
          success for all students, course content must be designed and maintained to ensure it is ADA and section 508 and section
          504 compliant. Please indicate that your course will meet the following requirements:
            Videos will be accurately captioned
            Audio files will be transcribed
            Objects (including images, tables, and charts) will have alternative text

            are specified, etc.)
          One of the primary concepts of distance education is to offer students learning anytime, anywhere. This means all DE
          courses and resources must be designed to give students with disabilities the opportunity to access distance education
          resources without the need for outside assistance, with built-in accommodation. With this in mind, is there any aspect of
          this course that cannot be made accessible to students with disabilities?

           Assignments
           In Class
           Programming assignments require that students analyze the given problem, develop various possible solutions, identify, anticipate and pose problems
           with the approaches under consideration, and select an approach on the basis of software design principles. After an approach has been decided
           upon, the student must implement that approach using the available tools. This requires improvisation, analysis and interpretation of program output.
           Finally, the program must be clearly documented.
           Out of class

          Title 5 and section 508 require that distance education complies with the Americans with Disabilities Act. To ensure
          success for all students, course content must be designed and maintained to ensure it is ADA and section 508 and section
          504 compliant. Please indicate that your course will meet the following requirements:
            Videos will be accurately captioned
            Audio files will be transcribed
            Objects (including images, tables, and charts) will have alternative text
            Course materials will be readable in terms of font, color contrast, and spacing. Color is not the only method used to convey meaning
            Hyperlink text will be meaningful
            Documents will be created in such a way that screen reading software can read them (i.e. styles are used, column header rows in tables
            are specified, etc.)
          One of the primary concepts of distance education is to offer students learning anytime, anywhere. This means all DE
          courses and resources must be designed to give students with disabilities the opportunity to access distance education
          resources without the need for outside assistance, with built-in accommodation. With this in mind, is there any aspect of
          this course that cannot be made accessible to students with disabilities?

          504 compliant. Please indicate that your course will meet the following requirements:
            Videos will be accurately captioned
            Audio files will be transcribed
            Objects (including images, tables, and charts) will have alternative text

           Program Narrative
           Program Goals and Objectives (this does not include the Catalog Description or Program Learning Outcomes) Example from MRTA degree:
           The primary goal of this program is: To develop students’ skills in music technology and recording arts to enter into music industry careers
           in sound engineering, performance, electronic music composition, sound design, music arranging, song writing, broadcast engineering,
           and equipment manufacturing. The two primary objectives of this program are: To produce trained musicians capable of creating
           professional quality musical projects that demonstrate the following knowledge and recording skills: pre and post production
           requirements, tracking, editing, mixing, effects processing, use of plug-ins, mastering of live or studio generated music, and knowledge
           and experience with the behavior of sound, hardware, software, and the musical skills used in a professional recording environment. To
           produce trained musicians capable of planning and executing the sound requirements for events in various environments, including
           studio, theatre, club, concert, convention, and other live situations, as a component of a professional production.
           The criminal justice program is designed to provide students with the basic theoretical knowledge that will prepare them for transfer and for career
           opportunities in pre-law, law enforcement, or corrections. The program develops a high level of academic, personal, and professional competence
           demanded in a wide range of agencies. Specific occupations include: police officer, deputy sheriff, community service officer, corrections officer,
           juvenile and adult probation officer, and emergency services dispatcher.

          Catalog Description and Program Learning Outcomes
          The Associate in Science in Administration of Justice for Transfer (A.S.-T in Administration of Justice) is intended for students who plan to complete a
          bachelor’s degree in a similar major at a CSU campus. Students completing these degrees are guaranteed admission to the CSU system, but not to a
          particular campus or major. The criminal justice program is designed to provide students with the basic theoretical knowledge that will prepare
          them for transfer and for career opportunities in pre-law, law enforcement, or corrections. The program develops a high level of academic, personal,
          and professional competence demanded in a wide range of agencies. Specific occupations include: police officer, deputy sheriff, community service
          officer, corrections officer, juvenile and adult probation officer, and emergency services dispatcher.  
          This degree may not be the best option for students intending to transfer to a particular CSU campus or to a university or college that is not part of
          the CSU system.  
          The following is required for all A.A.-T or A.S.-T degrees:  
          - Completion of 60 CSU-transferable semester units. 
          - Minimum grade-point average (GPA) of at least 2.0 in all CSU-transferable coursework.  While a minimum of 2.0 is required for admission, some
          majors may require a higher GPA.  
          - Completion of a minimum of 18 semester units in the major with a letter grade of "C" or better, or a "P" if the course is taken on a "pass/no pass"
          basis. 
          - Certified completion of the California State University General Education-Breadth pattern (CSU GE Breadth) or the Intersegmental General
          Education Transfer Curriculum (IGETC) pattern. 
          Note: statistics, SOC, and PSYCH courses are also general education courses and may be double-counted to meet the requirements of the degree.

          Master Planning Example from Elementary Algebra program: Many of the populations in the community that Cabrillo College serves have
          shown through assessment scores, performance in higher levels of math courses, and their ability to transfer to four-year universities that
          there is a need for a series of noncredit math courses that address these topics and are repeatable, affordable, and allow for more
          flexibility for student schedules. This certificate of competency meets that need. There are no competing noncredit programs and it is
          designed to enhance students’ performance in higher-level math courses and programs, ultimately leading to transfer.

          Enrollment and Completer Projections (this can include a list of the courses in the degree and how many sections and the enrollment
          numbers over the last several years) Example from MRTA program: Enrollment Projections MTRA enrollment projections are estimated to
          continue along their current trajectory. They have been running at full capacity (25 students per section) since the inception of the MTRA
          Skills Certificate Program and are often overenrolled with 30+ students per section. Cabrillo College typically offers four sections of MTRA
          courses each fall term and five each spring term, totaling approximately 125 students each fall and 150 students each spring, for an
          average of 275 students per year. Completer Projections Though this is a new application for an AS and Certificate of Achievement, our
          current MTRA Skills Certificate is in its 9th year. There are, on average, five graduates in the current program per year. With approval of
          the AS and Certificate of Achievement, the expectation for future program graduates is: 10 Skills Certificates, five Certificates of
          Achievement, and 2 Associate of Science degrees. Though the program is not specifically designed as a transfer program, several
          graduates have transferred recently to CSU-Monterey Bay to continue their work toward a BA in music technology, and one of those this
          past year simultaneously found employment as an audio technician/specialist at the nearby Seascape Resort.
          The college awarded 16 Associate in Science in Administration of Justice for Transfer (A.S.-T in Administration of Justice) degrees in the 2017-18
          academic year; 21 in the 2018-19 academic year.

          Place of Program in Curriculum/Similar Programs Example from Sustainable Agriculture Technology program: The Sustainable Agriculture
          Technology certificate will offer a new option that responds to cross-functional technical skills required by the emerging field of
          agriculture technology. The degree will be housed within the Horticulture Department, and will expand the current degree offerings of:
          Agriculture Plant Sciences A.S.-T Transfer Degree, General Horticulture & Crop Production A.S. Degree, and Landscape Horticulture A.S.
          Degree. None of the historical degree offerings are interdisciplinary as they have a traditional focus on horticulture and plant science. By
          adding in additional coursework within Engineering, Computer Applications/ Business Technology, Geography, Computer Science, and
          Computer and Information Systems we are able to craft a degree that prepares students for the digital, computer literate, and mechanical
          skills needed by an 21st century agriculture industry employee or grower. This program does not replace any existing program and serves
          to expand attainable degrees for students with cross functional interests in horticulture and technology and is a certificate version of our
          Sustainable Agriculture Technology A.S. Degree.
          As of Fall 2021, the Associate in Science in Administration of Justice for Transfer (A.S.-T in Administration of Justice)is the only degree offered by the
          Criminal Justice department at Cabrillo College.
          Similar Programs at Other Colleges in Service Area Example from Sustainable Agriculture Program: There are no similar programs in the
          college service area. Hartnell’s Agricultural Business and Technology Institute administration has been consulted with and it has been
          determined that none of their programs offer a similar Certificate of Achievement in sustainable agriculture technology.

                Take one course from three of the four different areas for an overall 3-unit maximum. One 3-      3
                unit course will not complete the Movement-Based Course requirement. Each course should
                be taken for 1 unit. Other KIN and DANCE courses may be used for the Movement Based
                Courses requirement IF they are documented as lower-division major preparation for the
                Similar Major at a CSU. Students may also substitute a higher-level course (i.e. level B or C).

          Program Goals and Objectives (this does not include the Catalog Description or Program Learning Outcomes) Example from MRTA degree:
          The primary goal of this program is: To develop students’ skills in music technology and recording arts to enter into music industry careers
          in sound engineering, performance, electronic music composition, sound design, music arranging, song writing, broadcast engineering,
          and equipment manufacturing. The two primary objectives of this program are: To produce trained musicians capable of creating
          professional quality musical projects that demonstrate the following knowledge and recording skills: pre and post production
          requirements, tracking, editing, mixing, effects processing, use of plug-ins, mastering of live or studio generated music, and knowledge
          and experience with the behavior of sound, hardware, software, and the musical skills used in a professional recording environment. To
          produce trained musicians capable of planning and executing the sound requirements for events in various environments, including
          studio, theatre, club, concert, convention, and other live situations, as a component of a professional production.
          Kinesiology is the academic discipline concerned with the art and science of human movement.  Students may pursue bachelors and
          graduate degrees with emphasis in adaptive physical education, athletic training, physical therapy, dance, movement sciences, sports
          management, teaching and coaching which provide numerous career opportunities in both the public and private sectors. Kinesiology
          may also be listed as physical education or human performance at some campuses.
          Catalog Description and Program Learning Outcomes
          The Associate in Arts in Kinesiology for Transfer (A.A.-T in Kinesiology) is intended for students who plan to complete a bachelor's
          degree in a similar major at a CSU campus. Kinesiology may also be listed as physical education or human performance at some
          campuses. Kinesiology is the academic discipline concerned with the art and science of human movement. Students may pursue
          bachelors and graduate degrees with emphasis in adaptive physical education, athletic training, physical therapy, dance, movement
          sciences, sports management, teaching, and coaching which provide numerous career opportunities in both the public and private
          sectors.  
          Students completing these degrees are guaranteed admission to the CSU system, but not to a particular campus or major. Students
          pursuing transfer to a specific campus or major concentration should pay careful attention to the courses they choose from List A to
          insure major preparation for their preferred campus.  
          See Associate Degree for Transfer information in the Cabrillo College catalog.   
          The following is required for all A.A.-T or A.S.-T degrees:  
           - Completion of 60 CSU-transferable semester units.  
           - Minimum grade-point average (GPA) of at least 2.0 in all CSU-transferable coursework.  While a minimum of 2.0 is required for
          admission, some majors may require a higher GPA.  
           - Completion of a minimum of 18* semester units in the major with a letter grade of "C" or better, or a "P" if the course is taken on a
          "Pass/No Pass" basis. *Note: this degree requires greater than 18 units in the major for completion. 
           - Certified completion of the California State University General Education-Breadth pattern (CSU GE Breadth) or the Intersegmental
          General Education Transfer Curriculum (IGETC) pattern. 
          Note: BIO, CHEM, PHYS, Statistics, and one unit of KIN or DANCE activity courses are also general education courses and may be double
          counted for requirements of the degree.

          Master Planning Example from Elementary Algebra program: Many of the populations in the community that Cabrillo College serves have
          shown through assessment scores, performance in higher levels of math courses, and their ability to transfer to four-year universities that
          there is a need for a series of noncredit math courses that address these topics and are repeatable, affordable, and allow for more
          flexibility for student schedules. This certificate of competency meets that need. There are no competing noncredit programs and it is
          designed to enhance students’ performance in higher-level math courses and programs, ultimately leading to transfer.
          No Value
          Enrollment and Completer Projections (this can include a list of the courses in the degree and how many sections and the enrollment
          numbers over the last several years) Example from MRTA program: Enrollment Projections MTRA enrollment projections are estimated to
          continue along their current trajectory. They have been running at full capacity (25 students per section) since the inception of the MTRA
          Skills Certificate Program and are often overenrolled with 30+ students per section. Cabrillo College typically offers four sections of MTRA
          courses each fall term and five each spring term, totaling approximately 125 students each fall and 150 students each spring, for an
          average of 275 students per year. Completer Projections Though this is a new application for an AS and Certificate of Achievement, our
          current MTRA Skills Certificate is in its 9th year. There are, on average, five graduates in the current program per year. With approval of
          the AS and Certificate of Achievement, the expectation for future program graduates is: 10 Skills Certificates, five Certificates of
          Achievement, and 2 Associate of Science degrees. Though the program is not specifically designed as a transfer program, several
          graduates have transferred recently to CSU-Monterey Bay to continue their work toward a BA in music technology, and one of those this
          past year simultaneously found employment as an audio technician/specialist at the nearby Seascape Resort.
          The college awarded 6 Kinesiology Associate in Arts in Kinesiology for Transfer (A.A.-T in Kinesiology) degrees in 2017-18, and 19 in the
          2018-19 academic year.  
          Projection: 10-20 Associate in Arts in Kinesiology for Transfer (A.A.-T in Kinesiology) degrees awarded each year
          Place of Program in Curriculum/Similar Programs Example from Sustainable Agriculture Technology program: The Sustainable Agriculture
          Technology certificate will offer a new option that responds to cross-functional technical skills required by the emerging field of
          agriculture technology. The degree will be housed within the Horticulture Department, and will expand the current degree offerings of:
          Agriculture Plant Sciences A.S.-T Transfer Degree, General Horticulture & Crop Production A.S. Degree, and Landscape Horticulture A.S.
          Degree. None of the historical degree offerings are interdisciplinary as they have a traditional focus on horticulture and plant science. By
          adding in additional coursework within Engineering, Computer Applications/ Business Technology, Geography, Computer Science, and
          Computer and Information Systems we are able to craft a degree that prepares students for the digital, computer literate, and mechanical
          skills needed by an 21st century agriculture industry employee or grower. This program does not replace any existing program and serves
          to expand attainable degrees for students with cross functional interests in horticulture and technology and is a certificate version of our
          Sustainable Agriculture Technology A.S. Degree.
          The Associate in Arts in Kinesiology for Transfer (A.A.-T in Kinesiology) is housed in the Kinesiology Department under the division of
          Health, Athletics, Wellness and Kinesiology.  The degree is in addition to Cabrillo College's existing Kinesiology Associate of Arts. 
          Similar Programs at Other Colleges in Service Area Example from Sustainable Agriculture Program: There are no similar programs in the
          college service area. Hartnell’s Agricultural Business and Technology Institute administration has been consulted with and it has been
          determined that none of their programs offer a similar Certificate of Achievement in sustainable agriculture technology.
          Discipline faculty aligned the Associate in Arts in Kinesiology for Transfer (A.A.-T in Kinesiology) to the TMC because of the clear and
          substantial benefits this alignment would provide community college students with the intent of transferring to a CSU. After reviewing the Transfer
          Model Curriculum (TMC), we ascertained that Cabrillo College already offers all of the courses identified on the TMC. We examined the C-IDs for the
          classes that we offer to ensure that the descriptions and learning outcomes of our classes are consistent with those that have been identified as core
          major preparation. We know that we have enough coverage of the suggested TMC courses to adequately offer the required core and elective
          classes that students need to complete the Associate in Arts in Kinesiology for Transfer (A.A.-T in Kinesiology) in a timely manner. 
          Both of Cabrillo’s local CSU’s, CSU Monterey Bay and San Jose State, have declared that the TMC based Associate in Arts in Kinesiology for
          Transfer (A.A.-T in Kinesiology) is a similar transfer associate degree.
