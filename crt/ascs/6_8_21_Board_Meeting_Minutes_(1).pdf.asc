     enjoyable. She watched Mariposa's 8th grade project presentation. Ms. Menges also visited White Oak Elementary and

    Mr. Lawrence visited Lindero Canyon Middle School. He shared a couple of pictures from his visit showing the
    innovative ways our teachers taught this year. It was amazing to see the students playing music outside. There are
    specially designed masks for each instrument. It was wonderful to see how innovative playing music has become during
    this pandemic. Mr. Lawrence spoke to the 8th grade Leadership Class. The students shared their concerns about the
    long term impact this pandemic will have on them. Mr. Lawrence continued that students are very resilient and will not
    be defined by their past. Mr. Lawrence attended the Calabasas Chamber of Education meeting this week. He gave a
    shout-out to the scholarships that were given out by the Chamber of Commerce. The Pumpkin Festival will come back

    students have been hard at work this year. Dr. Vadehra watched the CHS Music Concert which was incredible. The
    enthusiasm came through. She was able to watch the AHS Jazz ensemble play during the Ellington Jazz Festival which
    was wonderful. Those students won many awards. She also attended the Lindero Canyon Music Concert. She
    commented that the students played beautifully. Some of our athletes went to the play-offs which was wonderful. The

    the future. 
     
    Dr. Stepenosky was filled with appreciation and gratitude. He continued how exciting it will be to celebrate our middle
    school culminations and high school graduations this week. Dr. Stepenosky shared the success of both high school
    proms. He thanked and congratulated Dr. McClay and Ms. Exner for their fabulous work on those events. AHS went to
    Moorpark Country Club and CHS went to the Reagan Library. There were rave reviews from both parents and staff. Dr.
    Stepenosky shared that there were 160 student tutors this year. The Board and Cabinet issued a Proclamation for each
    of the AHS and CHS Student Tutors. He thanked them for their hard work. Dr. Stepenosky thanked Mr. Hochhaus for
    his advocacy for staff and his dedication. He congratulated Dr. Gleason on receiving his doctorate. His dissertation was
    on School Principal Retention in K-12 Schools. He hoped that all staff can get some time to relax over the summer.
    Next year will return to pre-pandemic times. 
     
    Dr. Finneran thanked all staff for all their hard work and shared that their work did not go unnoticed. The students will be
    better for this work. She thanked the retirees and wished them all success. She congratulated our 5th and 8th graders
    who will culminate on Wednesday and our 12th graders who will graduate on Thursday. All ceremonies will be live-
    streamed thanks to Mr. Klein and his team. Dr. Finneran said she has a 5th grade student culminating and a 12th grade

    had a phenomenal year. 
     
    Ms. Falk shared that Special Ed has a lot to be proud of. Special Ed led the way in bringing students back on campus.
    She shared some pictures of staff members who were the first to be on campus back on October 5, 2020. All
    assessments were kept up to date. All current assessments have been completed as well through virtual IEP's, etc. The
    department taught virtual and in-person students together. She congratulated all Special Education staff. They really
    deserve a well rested summer. 
     
    Ms. Amodio recognized the Classified Return to work Committee participants: Angie Falk, Scott Foli, Melissa Foster,
    Jan Gil, Elaine Gottfried-Ullman, Laura McLane, Julie Pescetto and Mike Roberts. They worked hard this year and

    approximately $500,000. If those are awarded, they will help our CTE programs. He also shared that we are currently
    recruiting for Center EdX PASC Cohort 8. The program continues to grow. The largest cohort of 20 candidates will start
    Fall 2021.   
      
     Dr. Scifres shared some athletic updates. He shared a slide from the CHS Baseball team 2nd round play-off game. The
     team won today 4-1 and will move on to the 3rd round of play-offs. Dr. Scifres gave a shout-out to all student athletes.

     Ms. Kimmel echoed the gratitude going around tonight. She thanked her fellow Cabinet members and Board members

     this summer at A.E. Wright Middle School. The hours will be Mondays and Wednesdays from 11:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m.

     Mr. Klein shared that the tech team is proud to share in the excitement of the culminations this year at A.C. Stelle, A.E.
     Wright, and Lindero Canyon Middle School. They built a system where the families could log in and register their four
     guests. This system really helped with seat assignments. Streaming events from a distant field is very challenging
     which occurs at our middle schools. The team had to mount some equipment to help with the internet service in the
     field. The high schools have fast WiFi in their stadiums which make it easier. We are thrilled to bring all culminations to
     a live-stream to allow more family members to share in the joy.

     ACTION ITEMS
     1. Approval of Award of Contract to Spectrum Enterprise was presented. Mr. Klein shared that the Federal Government
     created the E-rate program to assist public schools with communication services. The program offers a discounted rate
     off the standard retail rate for eligible communication services to schools and libraries. In March the District published
     the RFP for e-rate wide area network connection services for all district campuses with a proposal due date of March
    19, 2021. In response to the RFP, three proposals were received. Of the three vendors which submitted a proposal,
    Spectrum Enterprise scored the highest score (see attached e-rate bid evaluation worksheet). The deadline to sign the
    contract was a very tight window which is why this was not brought to the Board of Education sooner. Mr. Klein asked
    the Board to ratify the award of this contract.
     
    On Motion of Mr. Lawrence, seconded by Ms. Menges, the Board of Education approved Award of Contract to

    environment. Since we are going back to a traditional schedule in the fall, we do not need those additional hours.  
     
    On Motion of Mr. Lawrence, seconded by Dr. Vadehra, the Board of Education approved Resolution 19-20 Classified

    Ms. Kimmel introduced Ms. Torres to present the 2021-22 Budget. Ms. Torres shared that it is important to note that this
    budget is unlike any budget in the past. The world is turning the corner on a global health crisis caused by COVID-19,
    triggering massive job losses and business closures. Despite these challenges, the state’s revenues are projecting a
    $75.7 billion surplus as the top 1% of California earners continue to generate considerable personal income taxes for
    the state and people continue to make purchases. The excess revenue combined with $25 billion in federal relief
    supports a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to speed the state’s recovery from the pandemic and to address inequities.
    The Governor's budget includes a total of $121.7 billion in funding K-12, which is the highest in California history.
    LVUSD received several one-time grants totaling $16.5 million. The grants all have specific allocations and timelines for
    use. Out of the $16.5 million in grants, $14.7 million was used in the 2020-21 budget, leaving $1.8 million for the 2021-
    22 budget. Both LVEA and LVCA reached tentative agreements with the District and these agreements are included in
    the 2021-22 budget. This includes a certificated retro increase of 2%, totaling $1.2 million and a $700 one-time bonus
    for classified which totals $0.4 million. Classified will also receive a 4% increase in salary. Ms. Torres continued that with
    the return to full time on campus instruction, there are some additional expenses such as, increased clerical staff at the
    secondary campuses, increased I.A.'s and campus supervisors at the elementary schools, filled vacancies at Buttercup,
    transportation and bus pass revenues, increased utilities usage, and gradual return to facility rentals over the next 2-3
    years. The 2021-22 budget includes $122.1 million in revenues and $133 million in expenses for a net decrease of
    $10.9 million. Out of this, $6 million is related to strategic plan initiatives. Ms. Torres shared a slide showing LVUSD's
    declining enrollment. For the 2020-21 and 2021-22 school years, the state has allowed our ADA funding to be based on
     the 2019-20 school year numbers. This 2021-22 Budget will be brought to the Board at the June 22, 2021 Board
     meeting for formal approval. 
      
     On Motion of Mr. Lawrence, seconded by Ms. Menges, the Board of Education closed Public Hearing - Budget 21-22. 
     Board Motion Carried 5:0 as follows:
     AYES: Board members Cutbill, Lawrence, Menges, Stein, and Vadehra
     NAYES: None
      
     INFORMATION ITEMS
     1. Approval of 2020-21 Budget Adjustment was presented. Ms. Kimmel shared that the 2020-21 Budget Revisions were
     presented during the previous item. At the next Board meeting on June 22, 2021, the 2020-21 Budget will be an action
     item to be voted on.
      
     Ms. Stein asked if the Las Virgenes Independent School (LVIS) was included in next year's budget. Ms. Kimmel stated
     that she will update the budget to include LVIS.
