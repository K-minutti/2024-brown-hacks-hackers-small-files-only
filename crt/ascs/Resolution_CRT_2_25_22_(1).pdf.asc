        
              Resolution Condemning Inherently Divisive Concepts 
        
       Whereas, the mission of Campbell County Public Schools is to provide a world-class education 
       that enables every student to choose and pursue any post K12 endeavor; and 
        
       Whereas, current school board policy (JB) states: 
       Equal educational opportunities are available for all students, without regard to membership in 
       any category protected under Federal or Virginia law.  Educational programs are designed to 
       meet the varying needs of all students. 
        
       Whereas, current school board policy (INB) states: 
       The Campbell County School Board recognizes that preparation for effective citizenship is one 
       of the major purposes of education.  The preparation for effective citizenship includes the study 
       of issues that are controversial.  Such studies will be carried out in an atmosphere free from 
       bias, prejudice, or coercion.  In teaching about controversial issues, teachers are expected to 
         ●  Establish a learning environment where each student can study the issues within a 
          curriculum that is appropriate to his or her knowledge and maturity; and 
         ●  Provide instruction in an atmosphere that is free from bias, prejudice, or coercion. 
       Although the instructional program includes study of the political party system in the United 
       States, the School Board does not endorse any political party or candidate. 
        
       Whereas, current school board policy (IIA) states: 
       The Campbell County School Board is responsible for the selection and use of instructional 
       materials.  The Superintendent or his/her designee creates and updates, as necessary, 
       guidelines and procedures for the selection of instructional materials.  The guidelines and 
       procedures are designed to ensure that appropriate instructional materials are selected and 
       provide an opportunity for the professional staff and community to participate and be informed 
       on the selection and use of instructional materials.  Parents may inspect, on request, any 
       instructional material used as part of their student’s curriculum. 
        
       Whereas, Governor Youngkin’s Executive Order Number One states: 
       By virtue of the authority vested in me as Governor, I hereby issue this Executive Order to 
       ensure excellence in K-12 public education in the Commonwealth by taking the first step on Day 
       One to end the use of inherently divisive concepts, including Critical Race Theory, and to raise 
       academic standards.   
        
       Therefore, be it resolved, that Campbell County Public Schools will not teach Critical Race 
       Theory.  Nor will CCPS implement the use of divisive materials to supplement board-approved 
       curriculum materials, including the use of the 1619 Project. 
        
       Be it further resolved, that in accordance with Governor Youngkin’s Executive Order 
       Number One, no concepts in violation of Title IV and Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 will 
       be taught including, but not limited to, the following concepts: (i) one race, skin color, ethnicity, 
        
       sex, or faith is inherently superior to another race, skin color, ethnicity, sex, or faith; (ii) an 
       individual, by virtue of his or her race, skin color, ethnicity, sex or faith, is racist, sexist, or 
       oppressive, whether consciously or subconsciously, (iii) an individual should be discriminated 
       against or receive adverse treatment solely or partly because of his race, skin color, ethnicity, 
       sex or faith, (iv) members of one race, ethnicity, sex or faith cannot and should not attempt to 
       treat others as individuals without respect to race, sex, or faith, (v) an individual’s moral 
       character is inherently determined by his or her race, skin color, ethnicity, sex, or faith, (vi) an 
       individual, by virtue of his or her race, skin color, ethnicity, sex, or faith, bears responsibility for 
       actions committed in the past by other members of the same race, ethnicity, sex, or faith, (vii) 
       meritocracy or traits, such as hard work ethic, are racist or sexist or were created by a particular 
       race to oppress another race.
