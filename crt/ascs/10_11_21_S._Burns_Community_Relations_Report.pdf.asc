                    September 29, 2021 - Lansing USD 469 Election / Campaign Information  
                         It was brought to our attention that local school board candidates 
                         recorded political advertisements at Lansing USD 469 facilities. We felt it was 
                         necessary to inform our community that the district does not endorse and is not 
                         affiliated with any individual political candidate.
