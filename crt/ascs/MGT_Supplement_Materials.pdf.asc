                         Wanted to keep children at Terraset. Wanted to be within walking distance of middle and high schools. 
                         We are no longer assigned to that base school  
                         We are stationed here 
                         We bought family home 
                         we bought the house in williams meadow community, herndon, va-20171 
                         We chose this house and location because of Madison High School 
                         We did not know about fcps when we moved here, we needed to live near the metro. 
                         We had to get out of Loudoun County. We wanted a better future for our kids with less racist people living 
                          near us.

                         We love our unique home! 
                         We moved from CA in early 2017 at the turn of the administration. There was very low inventory. The home 
                          we moved into and continue to live in now was the best quality available at the price point we could afford. 
                         We moved into our home prior to having children and the area was central to our jobs a d affordable. We 
                          remain here for the community we have developed since having children.  
                         We purchased our home a while ago due to the schools but are in the process of moving our children to 
                          private schools because FCPS performance has declined greatly  
                         We simply liked the house. 
                         We wanted to live in the City of Fairfax, which is part of FCPS  
                         We work hard for our money and sacrifice to afford to live in this neighborhood. I accidentally marked that 
                          my daughter goes to Silverbrook. She did but she now goes to south county middle but this survey won’t

                         10 to 20 
                         "Should" is relative. I grew up with hour-long bus rides to get to magnet schools; my son's bus trip is about 
                          10 minutes from pickup from school to dropoff at his stop. I think anywhere in between those would be 
                          appropriate depending on age and circumstance.

                         Any to the base school. It is clear you are looking for the shortest time possible. Traveling 3 miles in the city 
                          can take 30 mins, whereas you can travel 12 miles in the same time outside of the city.

                         As long as it takes to get to the school the child has also attended with siblings and peers from their 
                          community. 
                         As long as needed to get to the school of preference.

                         As necessary (two responses) 
                         Current  policy  is  1  hour.  Transportation  will  not  drop  off  in  the  reverse  order  of  pickup.  This  adds 
                          unnecessary time. My elementary student travelled 1 hour for what takes 6 minutes to school. Not 
                          appropriate.

                         depends if they have an opportunity for special program or better academics and thus should be able to 
                          opt into a longer bus ride. other than that, max 30 mins

                         Depends on if the school attending is worth the commute 
                         Depends on the area and the route 
                         Depends on the school my kids go to 
                         Depends on the school. I went to TJ for high school and the bus ride was 45 minutes. For a better school or 
                          program, we would be willing for our kids to sit on the bus longer. 
                         Depends on their age. For elementary school I think it should be 15mins or les. 
                         Depends on what school they belong to 
                         Depends on where he lives and where he wants to go. Silly question.

                         Do not have a strong opinion on this.

                         Gradient for level. ElemSchool should be less than 20 minutes. HS could be up to 30 minutes.  
                         however long it takes 
                         However long it takes to get to the base school I chose to purchase my hone in.  
                         However long it takes to get to the school from your house. You chose to buy the house in the school district 
                          for a reason.  
                         I prefer my child not ride a bus. That is why we chose a house near an elementary and middle school he 
                          could walk to. abs  
                         I think that longer school bus routes may be justified if the school offers substantial benefit to the child 
                         if chosing to attend a special program, then travel time is irrelevant 
                         If some kids have a long commute in the AM then drop them off first in the PM. My student is <3 miles from 
                          school but the bus ride is 45 min each way!! 
                         If there were more bus drivers the commute would be less  
                         it depend how far they live from school 
                         It depends 
                         It depends on the child's age, the younger the child, the less time they should spend on the bus. For a HS 
                          student, up to 30 minutes is not unreasonable 
                         It depends on the need but in general 45 mins each way 
                         It depends on the student! 
                         it depends on their location and the route 
                         It depends. Level IV or TJ students require longer commutes.  
                         It shouldn't matter if they can attend a program of interest, people do it all the time for activities or driving 
                          to special schools 
                         It takes 30 minutes to walk to and 30 minutes more to walk from school

                          the day. So it is very hard to pick up my daughter. She can not use the school bus because of the distance 
                          to school. I was very suprised that we can not use school bus.

                         should never be on a bus 
                         The bus is not offered 
                         The length of the ride matters less than the quality of the school 
                         These times are not ideal because of traffic patterns and school schedules- this question does not seem to 
                          factor local transportation volume/capacity and designated start and end times for the school day. 
                         This is for my student, who lives a mile from school. 
                         This may vary based on the school 
                         This year the buses aren't typical. 
                         Time and Mileage are different. Used to take 15 mintures to get to Langley, now it's much longer due to 
                          traffic. 
                         Unrealistic question. School can be very close by but amount of stops makes commute 10x to 15x the time

                         We would like to use the bus but it is a 1 hour ride home. That isn’t acceptable. Forced across town for AAP 
                          all day class. We should have an additional Full time AAP when there are these distances to travel 
                         Whatever time permits a just and inclusive school experience for my child. I was bussed 40 mins across 
                          town to integrate schools as a child, and I'm okay with my child doing the same if it means she interacts 
                          with a critical mass of kids outside of her own cultural experience. 
                         Zero

                         Considering private school. 1) Not happy with all the changes to FCPS policies - not the same school system 
                          as when we attended FCPS (WPHS and Woodson HS). 2) West Potomac is extremely overcrowded. The 
                          County keeps building more multi-family residences along Route 1 so the problem will continue to get 
                          worse. Another high school needs to be opened on the western side of Route 1.

                          the fact that almost entirely entire class she goes to elementary school with will attend another school  
                         I didn’t trust FCPS to stay open so we enrolled in a private school 
                         I would like her to go to a closer school. There are 2 closer schools. FHS is too far compared to them. At

                          and forced to go to base school only. My kid can save lot of time in commute by going to the nearest FCPS

                         allow students to transfer to closer schools 
                         Allowing family members to go to same school siblings did 
                         Allowing siblings to go where older siblings went 
                         Always allow students to be grandfathered in if you do a boundary change  
                         Anything but #8 and #9 
                         Anything related to "diversity" or "equity" 
                         Ask why residents are choosing alternate schools like private or charter, and improve their public school 
                          and market that to bring those students back to their neighborhood public schools.  
                         athletics 
                         Avoid boundary changes at all costs because they are disruptive and devisive 
                         Avoid moving students to an unfamiliar school 
                         Avoid taking students out of a familiar school 
                         Balance so not to have too many in one school  
                         Balancing out high needs students across schools- ex: MVHS has a higher proportion of at risk students than 
                          neighboring high schools because of the boundary movements a few years ago 
                         Based on concrete long-term data free from political whim 
                         Be aware that changing schools can affect home value  
                         Better school start/finish times - 9 to 4 is ridiculous 
                         Boundaries need to be evaluated and leadership given to individual/groups of school to make decisions on 
                          weather closures when the geography/territory is so vast across the entire Fairfax County  
                         boundaries  should  be  drawn  based  on  the  physical  location  of  the  students  primary  residence,  not 
                          creatively to change the dynamic of the students 
                         Boundary changes should not be made to directly impact school board members’ property values 
                         Boundary changes should not be used to advance racial or socio-economic policies. Children should go to 
                          school nearest to where they live. Community-based schools are critical for the social-emotional well-being 
                          of all of our students, and any other assignment destroys community regardless of economic status. 
                         Break up Fairfax into a b c d and build bigger schools.  
                         Bring french to schools on the other side of the county (elementary) 
                         Bring quality education to all children within the county, fairly 
                         Build additional infrastructure at current schools with high density populations  
                         Build more MS and HS 
                         Build more schools in heavily developing areas to reduce over crowding of current schools. 
                         Build more schools to keep the student population small 
                         Build schools with increased population in mind. By the time westfields hs was built it was over crowded!

                         Building materials 
                         By changing boundaries you significantly decrease property values <= and TAXES that fund schools and 
                          superintendent and overpriced survey salaries. 
                         Change boundaries if you don’t live near AAP school MOVE 
                         changing lifecycle of remodel/construction to 20 years to allow for right-sized facilities 
                         Charter school (two responses)  
                         Check often for proof of residency 
                         Children should be able to attend a school closer to their home. In our case we can walk to an elementary 
                          school yet we are zoned for something so far a way. If families are in walking distance they should be able 
                          to attend the school instead of having to bus their kids to a school further away.  
                         Children should not have to change schools - boundary changes should be for new students only  
                         Clifton Elementary - need school in this area.  
                         Climate change impacts 
                         Close schools (two responses) 
                         Collaborate with county residential officials to balance out the amount of new residential construction with 
                          the ability of schools to take on new students. 
                         Consider construction growth and need of classrooms to modify existing schools 
                         Consider how new housing impacts schools 
                         Consider people's investments in their property before changing school boundaries. They choose their 
                          home in many cases based on a specific school. This should be taken into account before changing 
                          boundaries at all.  
                         Consider that some people may have purchased their home with the desire to attend a specific, elementary, 
                          middle and high school  
                         Construct additions if needed 
                         Cracking down on students who do not actually live in the county or even state 
                         Create academic excellence 
                         Create good school and high standards public education for everyone! This will eliminate any need of 
                          changing boundaries or have families sacrifice to buy houses close to good schools. This is number one issue 
                          in the U.S. the rest does not really matter. 
                         Create more blended environment 
                         Create more magnet schools 
                         Create more online options 
                         Create more specialized programs or schools in each district  
                         Create schools only focused on AAP and immersion. More TJ schools at all levels. Remove those kids from 
                          the other schools. 
                         Create specialized programs (especially AAP) in all pyramids to avoid going in and out of pyramid and region. 
                         Create strong magnet schools for gifted kids

                         Create Virtual Schools as an option for all student  
                         Diversity  
                         diversity in schools should not be a priority in redistricting. we moved to Fairfax where we are for a reason 
                          and it would be a horrible use of tax dollars to transport kids into schools that are not where they live1 
                         Diversity Is a beautiful thing, quotas are shameful  
                         Do not allow students to change schools based on programs offered at another school  
                         Do not base school boundaries to <diversify <. Parents choose to live in school zone based on school and 
                          reputation. Stop teaching to lowest common denominator  
                         Do NOT bus Vienna kids to section 8 heavy areas schools like what happened to my generation- loved the 
                          shootings, stabbings, gang s#!+ from Marshall h.s. in the 90s. I witnessed lower exclusion yes, but that 
                          affected others education and the teachers were miserable then. Happened to Annandale and Oakton areas 
                          as well. I hope it is better now a days, but with the mixed 'diversity,' how is that fair to kids and education 
                          standards ?? Do not think in theory, think is reality. Standards of Learning need to be taken into account 
                          and schools should be adjusted that way. Be intelligent. Kindergarten through to 12th grade should stay 
                          the same, nit divide at middle school or h.s. that is dumb and does not work well. I have lived it as did the 
                          boomer generation before me. 
                         Do not change ANYTHING during a pandemic! 
                         Do not change boundaries (two responses) 
                         Do not change students school during time planned in that school (e.g. don't change a HS student's school 
                          sophmore year 
                         Do not change the school boundary. 
                         Do not change the school boundary. Boundary changing affect people life. It is not your call to change the 
                          school boundary 
                         Do not execute raciasm and/or reverse discrimination in the name of diversity. Use our tax money wisely 
                          and responsibly to improve safety, transporation, roads and construct new schools. Money is not wisely 
                          spent by hiring so called "third party" or "independent" consultant for boundary changes. Who evaluates 
                          and approves the qualification of the consultant? Who can prove the consultant's "independency"? 
                         do not know what an attendance island is 
                         DO NOT MOVE SENIORS 
                         Do not move students once they are in middle and high school. Elementary school students are far more 
                          adaptable  to  change  in  ways  that  become  more  difficult  as  students  move  into  the  upper  grades. 
                          Elimination of attendance islands is obvious. They should have never existed.  Some areas of the county will 
                          be more populated than others. New construction rather than creating long and grueling bus rides is a 
                          better approach.  Getting rid of AAP would also be another very good change. It is an old outdated model 
                          that needs to be reimagined (equity is not AAP). AAP is the opposite of equity and as a practice it stunts 
                          social emotional growth by keeping students in the same class of peers for four years in elementary school. 
                          Absolutely not the way to teach being adaptive, collaborative, and flexible. It coddles and creates islands of 
                          students with false notions of superiority. 
                         Do not shift kids once they are in HS.  
                         Do what's best for students and not what's best for testing scores

                         Do yearly boundary adjustments to keep school populations balanced. The current process is too slow, 
                          leaving students stewing in overcrowded schools with hallways like mosh pits during a pandemic.  
                         Do you not pick and choose to go to the school based on their race

                         Don't allow multiple families to live in single family housing. 
                         don't change boundaries 
                         Don't change boundaries near the schools. People move to specific neighborhoods because of the schools. 
                          They shouldn't be excluded from going to a school system in which they are very close to the schools system 
                          they desire.  
                         Don't change schools for kids already attending

                         Don't do boundary changes on kids with IEP's. They are the most vonerable kids and don't need the extra 
                          stress. (two responses) 
                         Don't enforce new boundaries prior to a public five year notification of a boundary change. 
                         Don't have a student drove past one school to get to another school. 
                         Don't let just one street cutting across decide the school. Be more pragmatic. If more than one school is 
                          within a certain radius, please provide parents the choice to pick the one that they would like to send their 
                          child to 
                         Don't make kids change their middle or high schools because of boundary changes. 
                         Don't move a child away form a school they are ALREADY attending, can be very traumatizing. 
                         Don't move a student out of a school they have already started. Give them a choice. 
                         Don't rotate children from year to year. Let them become friends and build friendship, not networking!

                          equivalent of better than the success rate of the base school. In other words, for me the solution is not to 
                          just create a new school.  
                         I don't know what you mean by "neighborhood schools" or "attendance islands"

                         If this is a FFX schools survey, why didn't you include all schools. You are missing Carl Sandburg MS and Fort

                         Maintain the school rating because most of the case parents pressured by low rating school to a better 
                          rated school. This tendency could reduce the students in low rating school in future.

                          minutes car ride) schools will be more diversified. now we have a racist system. Rich go to some schools

                         split-feeder schools should all have their boundaries addressed so that the small population currently

                         stop allowing affluent families to segregate into certain high schools. I'm upset that 2 very nice single family

                         Stop making special school. Like TJ you spend way more on that than on other students. This is an outrage 
                          as the majority of the kids who go there are already privlaged - FOR SHAME

                         Students should attend the school closest to their house unless in a special program but programs like TJ

                         Taxes on homes directly impacts school scores. If you live in a community where home prices are low and 
                          taxes are low, the school scores are low. We are ignoring the income gap which directly impacts our schools 
                         The only answer to this problem is to go back to 7 classes a day and have an early and late dismissals

                          to school or centralized pickup spot for a bus to grab all the kids from. 
                         Give parents all information needed in order to make the right decision for the safety of the children. School 
                          is overcrowded we RECOMMEND you change schools as long as transportation will be provided and certain 
                          accommodation will be made. Parents will work the schools. But parents need full detail information to 
                          make an informed decision to help our schools and community.  
                         Give parents the option to allow their child to go to a farther school to reduce crowding if the parent is 
                          willing. Give people that choice first.  
                         Give people a time buffer to make the move to new school? Like by the start of the following school year if 
                          notified by Dec 31 of preceding year kind of thing? 
                         give several years notice for boundary changes to be implemented

                         Gradual process 
                         Grandfather current residents, regardless of whether their children are enrolled yet or not. Some people 
                          move to a neighborhood so that their kids can attend a certain school in the future.  
                         Grandfather options to siblings  
                         grandfather people

                         Have a direct feed made from the original, if folks are in the zones to be corrected, LIKE DUNN LORING,

                         High  school  students  can  pupil-place  to  remain  at  their  current  HS  but  must  provide  their  own 
                          transportation if re-zoned. Otherwise, all students should attend the newly assigned school.  
                         High schoolers currently attending should be allowed to remain at their high school through graduation but

                         HS kids can continue at their school regardless of the change. 
                         HS students can choose to move to newly assigned school 
                         If a boundary change affects a senior, the senior should be allowed to remain at, and graduate from, the 
                          original base school. 
                         If a cohort has been affected by a boundary change in the past and us affected again, every effort should 
                          be made to keep peers/grade together to promote lasting friendships 
                         If a student has a sibling at a HS/MS, they should be allowed to attend that school. 
                         If in high school can remain at that school or choose to move to new school 
                         if kids go to a different school their real estate tax dollars should follow them. (two responses) 
                         If you buy you are grandfathered in for all siblings, if you rent you go to the new assigned school (think 
                          military  rental  market).  For  top  line:"All  new  students"  should  read  "All  new  families"  as  your  new 
                          kindergartner should follow siblings that might be in 2nd grade 
                         In general, get better teachers and the students will come. That is for any school. Our principal is the best 
                          we ever had, Mr. Morris. He understands diversity and inclusion. You MUST do that before trying to bus in 
                          lower income students in this higher income areas. The students end up being mistreated as if it's the 60s.  
                         Increased flexibility for students with siblings in special programs, ie immersion 
                         Instead of boundary change, schools should have constructions. 
                         It is hard to tell. Fairfax County is one of the most expensive counties in VA which makes people leave bc it 
                          is difficult to afford living in it. It wouldn't be able to tell. 
                         It should not effect kids with IEPs. They already have enough hardships. Moving them to a new school is 
                          the worst impact you could have on special needs kids 
                         It would be nice to allow kids currently in a school to stay in that school.  
                         Keep children from the same family in the same school and make sure that assigned or new school meets 
                          all the needs of the child/family (I.e., AAP, Special Ed, extracurricular, etc) 
                         Keep communities and schools together. Use all the leftover Covid money to build buildings instead of give 
                          crappy free lunches to EVERYONE! If you assign new students to a different school than their next door 
                          neighbor, that doesn't build community or nurture the social emotional well being of literally the new kid 
                          on the block.  
                         keep kids of the same family together 
                         Keep siblings in the same school if they are in the age range  
                         Keep siblings together. (two responses) 
                         Keep siblings/families remain at same school, other new students attend newly assigned school 
                         Keep students from a family together all the way through 
                         Leave boundaries in place because they can dramatically change property values 
                         leave us alone. People buy in desired school districts and don't want it messed with. We hear FCPS wants 
                          to start bussing kids in and out--ridiculous. 
                         Let families and student choose what is best for them.

                         Let kids finish the elementary school they're in, then switch to the new boundary school. Likewise, let kids 
                          7 - 12 finish in their current pyramid. All new enrollment go to the new boundaries, and currently enrolled 
                          have option of switching if they want.

                         May need to include on an individual basis to minimize disruption to a student and ensure stability. My son 
                          started all over again with tesoect to meeting new students when he started Oakton. The pandemic didn't 
                          help and so this year, he gets to pick up where he left off two years ago. We were thinking of moving where 
                          he m8ght have to change schools. He wants to finish and graduate from Oakton.  
                         Middle & high school especially should remain in existing pyramid  
                         Middle  school  children  can  remain  in  high  school  pyramid.  Elementary  children  should  follow  new

                         Move the AAP centers away from the overpopulated schools to the underpopulated or underperforming 
                          schools. 
                         Never change boundaries 
                         New students to FCPS who have siblings currently enrolled in school will attend the same school as their 
                          siblings 
                         No boundaries change needed

                         No boundaryt change is needed. Add new constructions to the crowded schools and close the schools with

                         No moves to school that is currently attended. Any boundary changes would happen when child changes

                         No outside agencies, this should be done by the Superintendent and voted on by the entire county.

                         Offer a choice before force to move 
                         Offer flexibility. Families have different children of different ages and what is right for one family after a 
                          boundary change may not be right for another family. There needs to be flexibility for affected families!

                          are needed. We cannot keep adding more kids to existing schools. 
                         Option for students/families to remain in the high school pyramid if students are in high school

                         Start new schools with advanced and specialized programs seeking to voluntarily attract new students 
                          rather than assign 
                         Stop overdeveloping the county 
                         Stop the ridiculous boundaries where neighbohoods have different schools from street to street. 
                         Student choice for those living on the new boundary 
                         Student with special needs can stay in their current school as an exemption. If they are thriving, do not 
                          change anything. 
                         Students are grandfathered in to last year at a given level (grade 6,8,12) 
                         students at the highest grade should remain in their current school. (ie 6th, 8th and 12th.) Lower grades 
                          should follow the new boundaries. 
                         Students attend geographically nearest school 
                         Students attend the new school when switching buildings ie going to middle school or high school, new 
                          students start in their assigned school.  
                         students can change to the new boundary school, however transfers will still be allowed 
                         Students can choose to remain but it does not obligate FCPS to provide transportation.  
                         Students currently assigned to schools should not be assigned to different schools. We took a home in this 
                          neighborhood to get these schools and we are not interested in getting any other school unless they have 
                          a better rating than the current. 
                         Students currently enrolled in Middle school and high school can remain in their pyramid if they choose. 
                          Students in elementary school would move to new school pyramid when they graduate elementary. New 
                          students to FCPS would be in new boundaries across all schools.  
                         Students  currently  in  9-12  given  option  to  stay  in  current  school  (grandfathered/provide  own 
                          transportation) or move to new school (FCPS bus transportation provided). 
                         Students currently in a school should not be forced to change pyramids  
                         Students entering last year of school may remain in their original school for the last year. 
                         Students in high school should be able to choose current school of new assigned school. 
                         Students in last year at school may remain at that school 
                         Students in specialized programs can choose to stay at current school or newly assigned school. 
                         Students may keep the same school trajectory as when they first enrolled 
                         Students new to school follow new boundaries 
                         Students new to the school attend new school, existing students choose, siblings can attend whatever 
                          school their sibling is currently enrolled 
                         Students should remain in their neighborhood school 
                         Students who are in high school can stay at the current school or choose to move to the new high school  
                         Students who are out of boundary due to IEP placement should  not have that placement discussion 
                          impacted by a district decision to change boundaries.  
                         Students with 1 more year in the current school finish out their career at that school

                         students with 1-2 years left at a school can stay, all others must move 
                         The boundaries should make sense and not carve out individual streets 
                         The highschool students don’t need to change the school  
                         The least amount of disruption to students already in school should take place. 
                         The survey forces the ranking question above, and auto-ranked the answers as soon as I scrolled the survey. 
                          Disregard the answers to that ranking question. They are not our answers. We don’t like the ranking options 
                         There needs to be balance between new students and current students so families don’t get separated 
                          unless they are given the choice and want to follow that path.  
                         There should be a choice for students to attend or remain at their base school 
                         There should not be boundary criterion to decide school for the child 
                         Think it is really important to allow siblings to attend the same school.  This in theory means it could take 
                          up to 10 years for a boundary change to be fully implemented. 
                         To be announced 5 years in advance 
                         Try to reduce disruption and dislocation of students (and their siblings) as much as possible 
                         Two year phase in - all rising students can have a choice to go to new school, or continue in their existing 
                          pyramid. For two years out, all rising students transfer to new school. No one forced out of an existing 
                          school (although they can opt out). 
                         Use evidence based practices  
                         Using phasing/grandfathering as much as possible 
                         Vote on school boundary change 
                         We are military. Changing schools is SO disruptive to children. When we moved here we chose a school 
                          pyramid based off strong academics, high achieving students, high military attendance, and the best 
                          supports for military students in northern Virginia. We paid far more than we would have if we bought 5 
                          miles down the road, for an older house in worse condition so we could attend the West Springfield 
                          pyramid, to give our military kids the most stability and a military community experience. Please do not 
                          take away our ability to make a thoughtful decision for our kids well being, by bussing kids and rezoning 
                          schools unecessarily.  
                         WE EXPECT OUR CHILDREN TO REMAIN AT THEIR ELEMENTARY SCHOOL!!!!!!! 
                         When you change boundaries, grandfather in existing families for one year and give one year's notice. 
                          Ideally, it would be great to have open enrollment - but I recognize that there are schools that don't want 
                          the richness that comes with a diverse student/ teacher population. 
                         Younger siblings can enroll where older siblings attend within original boundaries  
                         Younger siblings can start at the same school an older sibling attends in the old boundary 
                         Younger siblings must be grandfathered into existing boundaries to keep the family together after a 
                          boundary change 
                         younger siblings should be grandfathered to stay in HS pyramid/existing schools 
                         Younger siblings should have the choice to stay in the original pyramid.

                 Please share any additional thoughts on the future boundary 
                 policy. 
                         A child already enrolled in a school should not be required to change schools, especially middle and high 
                          school students, although they may have the option to do so. If a pyramid change occurs, it should only 
                          happen between elementary and middle school. 
                         Any future boundary changes should NOT affect current students, OR THEIR NEIGHBORHOODS. You will 
                          drastically  affect  home  values  without  sufficient  voter/resident  impact.  More  than  just  students  are 
                          affected by this. 
                          Boundary changes deeply anger and divide communities and we already have enough of that in society. I 
                          am against using political and social justice motives as guiding factors. Please use transportation and 
                          enrollment as your guidance.  
                          Changes like this can be detrimental to families and students. Any consideration of change should be future 
                          change and not extend further the days of students. FCPS should look at root cause for under or over 
                          population, not attempt to make this based on race or financial disparity 
                          Every student already in a school, especially a high school, should be allowed to stay and complete high 
                          school in that school. No moving students once they are enrolled in a particular school. 
                          My primary concern is that my child had continuity in his education and that he stayed in the schools I 
                          intended for him to attend when buying my house. It is also important to consider how boundary changes 
                          can affect people's real estate values. 
                          Orange Hunt is over crowded and and keep putting trailers in and has a weird boundary line on FCPW 
                          where those people should probably go to Hunt Valley  
                          The policy must ensure that existing students and siblings of those students should NOT EVER be forced 
                          into a school reassignment or change to their existing pyramid. 
                         Moving kiddos should be a last resort 
                         Region 3 students should have the ability to attend the school that is closest to their residence. Renovate 
                          some of the schools to accommodate projected growth or add to existing schools. " 
                         (1) students already enrolled in a particular school must not be made to change schools; (2) FCPS should 
                          publicly and clearly specify the metrics used in any change to boundary policy 
                         *Commute time 16-30 minutes includes time in traffic.  
                         1 - A uniform strategy might not be appropriate across a county larger than 8 states. 2 - PWCPS changes 
                          boundaries all the time. Talk to them about their practices. 3 - NO MORE TJ'S 4 - Specialized programs allow 
                          parents to game the system. 5 - Too much choice will undermine the changes 
                         1) Fairfax should ensure that the funds allocated per student is on par with the funding in the top 10 states. 
                          2) Fairfax should focus on ensuring that there is equity in the school system such that there are no schools 
                          that are rated a 10 while others are rated a 2 or below 5. All should be 7+. 
                         1) If a student/parent want a program, they will travel to get it. 2) If a lecture-style class has low enrollment 
                          in some schools, consider a hybrid option to allow more access. 3) Build larger schools/evaluate more often 
                          in urban areas (more apartment buildings, closer to public transportation.   
                         1)  Offer  similar  programs  and  access  to  all,  2)  Build  bigger  schools  near  apartment  buildings/public 
                          transportation, evaluate them more often, put popular programs in them.

                                                                                         FAIRFAX SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIALS 
                         1.  keep  kids  together  from  their  pyramid  2.  reduce  transportation, have  more walkers 3. have more 
                          vocational school options closer to school vase 4. get rid of temporary trailers 5. adjust school times each 
                          day and thru the year to make classes smaller 
                         1. PLEASE consider providing shorter bus transportation time route. Sometimes, the route to school is 
                          detouring a lot. 2. PLEASE consider having LESS number of students per class.  
                         1. reduce student to teacher ratios!! 2.carefully monitor schools and students with behavior problems and 
                          address these at once so that the learning and behavior of the other students are affected (we've got some 
                          talented teachers!!) 
                         1. Schools that are severely over or under capacity should be prioritized for boundary changes. 2.Siblings 
                          should have the option to choose to stay in the same HS pyramid if their boundary changes. 3.Pls consider 
                          if policy should require a property value impact of boundary changes study to be done  
                         10+ years ago, Oakton HS received a large number of redistricted students from Fairfax HS. The result: 
                          Fairfax HS is now under capacity, and Oakton is the most overcrowded school in the county - 131% capacity. 
                          Robbing Peter to pay Paul is bad planning. Don't redistrict just to MOVE a problem. 
                         2 year phase in - all rising students (for the 1st year) can have a choice to go to new school, or continue in 
                          their existing pyramid. For 2 years out, all rising students transfer to new school. No one forced out of an 
                          existing school if currently enrolled (can opt to change); until rising. 
                         A better solution for the families is to fix the size of the school (create more, etc) rather than continually 
                          moving the boundaries since so many of us live where we do to get into a specific school. I would be PISSED 
                          if I had to move to keep the schools the same for my kids. 
                         A lot more goes into a school boundary change that needs to be taken into consideration:  such as house 
                          value, why you moved to a specific neighborhood is for current school pyramid. New developments that 
                          spring up within the pyramid can be considered out of bounds, but home buyers must aware. 
                         a lot of people buy houses and property values are related to the high school pyramid. changing Thomas 
                          Jefferson Magnet entry policies may be enough to encourage people to move to other neighborhoods 
                          rather than focusing on a few good high schools.  
                         A personal concern I have is that our child is in an elementary school where about 90-95% will go to one 
                          middle/high school, but the the 5-10% from our neighborhood will be sent to another, where they will know 
                          far fewer children from their own grade. Would love to see this change. 
                         A priority should be to avoid moving students out of their existing school (unless they choose to do so). I 
                          support having new enrollees follow new boundaries, but siblings should be able to follow an older child. 
                         A systematic boundary policy needs to be put in place to balance student enrollment, avoid gerrymandering 
                          due to ad hoc boundary changes and to allow access to specialized programs with reasonable travel times. 
                          Having classrooms in trailers have been a stop gap solution for too long. 
                         A tough change but sometimes necessary. Kids probably handle better than students. Parents need to 
                          understand the positive aspects to having kids go to a closer less crowded school. Don’t make HS students 
                          change schools - that’s hard. Start shifting the rising freshman each year 
                         AAP and immersion can stay in the neighborhood schools and the many school buildings now used for 
                          administrative purposes can be reopened  
                         AAP boundaries should follow the high school pyramid of the base school. My child started at Kings Park 
                          which is in the Lake Braddock pyramid, but is attending AAP at Keene Mill which is not so when she hits

                                                                                         FAIRFAX SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIALS 
                         AAP center schools should be in the same pyramid as their base schools. For example - kids from Lee’s 
                          Corner and Oak Hill should go to Rocky Run not Carson. And kids from Fox Mill should go to a center school 
                          that feeds into their South Lakes HS not Oak Hill (Chantilly pyramid) then Carson (Oakton)! 
                         AAP creates attendance islands where small groups of students will remain together from ES to MS to HS. 
                          More should be done to keep AAP centers consistent with HS pyramids. Busing including AAP should strive 
                          to keep students on the bus less than 45 min. 1st on/1st off busing could be set up. 
                         AAP level 4 programs should be spread out to every school. Even if grades have to be combined in one class.  
                         AAP, Spanish immersion, STEM, advanced arts programs should be centered in the most disadvantaged 
                          schools to encourage diversity. Some families speak more than one other language at home. We speak 
                          Arabic and Spanish. 
                         Absolutely no demographic or equity based evaluation should be considered in any boundary decision 
                          making.  Only  geographic  (eg;  travel/transportation  times)  and  aggregate  student  volumes  should  be 
                          considered.  
                         absolutely NOT change current boundary. With limited travel distance, it is easy for kids as well as parents. 
                          Parents move and purchase new home more than 50% because of schools. When the boundary changes, it 
                          will not only change the travel time, but also decrease good school house price. NO CHANGE 
                         Accommodate students on the bus who are just under the 1 mile radius limit - drop offs and pick ups for 
                          multiple kids from the same family will become so much easier.  
                         Add level 4 aap to all schools and eliminate centers that tend to be overcrowded. No more trailers, make 
                          actual additions to schools or build new schools to accommodate growing population. 
                         Additional programming at under enrolled schools will not help their enrollment. Parents will continue to 
                          move their children to what they see as "better" schools until that option is taken away. Schools should be 
                          the community center and those who live around it should attend their base school. 
                         Adjust boundaries more often (yearly). Apply the changes to new students. Allow existing students the 
                          option to move. Break up under performing school pyramids  
                         Advanced notice of 3 years should be provided before a boundary change 
                         After a boundary change occurs, FCPS should 1. grandfather in students that are already in the prior 
                          boundary to continue through high school, and 2. allow parents to choose to send their children to the new 
                          boundary school if they want. 
                         After being shot four times while serving in Afghanistan, I was asked by Gary Sinise where I wanted him to 
                          build me a wheelchair accessible home. Unanimously, my wife and I told him Fairfax County. Not because 
                          of its taxes, but quality and diversity of schools. 
                         All boundary changes (no matter the number of students affected or emergency situation) should have at 
                          least one public meeting and an opportunity for parents to submit written comments. The proposed policy 
                          changes to allow the superintendent to make changes without public input are ridiculous. 
                         All current enrolled students should be able to attend their high school pyramid  
                         All Elementary (K-6), Middle and High schools within FCPS should have all the different FCPS programs so 
                          as to reduce the number of students moving across boundaries to access specific programs. 
                         All FCPS schools should offer the same programs and opportunities for children. Requiring proactive metrics 
                          of enrollment and flexibility of schools to meet community need. IMO will lead to greater diversity since 
                          parents will be reassured that every school has the same environment for our children.

                         all Kindergarten and elementary school kids should arrive at school by bus when it's more than 0.5 mile. 
                         All Oak View ES students should attend Robinson Secondary for both middle and high school. 
                         All of your pretty words can be reduced to one thing: You want to bus children based on proxies for race. 
                          Don't.This  has  repeatedly  been  shown  to  shatter  communities  and  reduce  outcomes  for  the  most 
                          vulnerable, not improve them. Focus on educating our children and not re-engineering society 
                         All options should be considered that would eliminate the need for boundary changes. 
                         All pyramids should have a level 4 AAP program so students don't have to go to a school in a different 
                          pyramid for elementary/ middle and then have to switch to their base pyramid for middle/ high school.  
                         All students currently in the pyramid their families chose to move to should be unaffected by any boundary 
                          changes.  
                         All students/families who are currently enrolled in school should remain in the high school pyramid  
                         All the students who have been in FCPS for more than 3 yers should be able to choose or change the school 
                          assigned if they feel to keep the old boundaries of fcps since many students live in FFX because the high 
                          rates of the schools 
                         Allow a students to continue attending the same school if they move outside the boundary within our 
                          district. Socio-economic diversity is important when creating the boundaries because school performance 
                          is greatly impacted if the majority of the students come from one particular income bracket.  
                         Allow more flexibility for students who want to elect to attend undercrowded schools from over crowded 
                          ones.  
                         Allow  parents  to  elect  to  move  to  lower  density  schools  while  noting  they  will  provide  their  own 
                          transportation. Make the ability to choose a different school more transparent. 
                         Allow students and their families to decide to chose if they want to change or not, don't force them to 
                          change until they finish through high school. 
                         Allow the option to attend the school that is closer to their home even if it’s not within the boundary.  
                         Already voted for this, but I strongly support allowing current families the choice to remain at their current 
                          school or to follow the new boundary changes. We bought our home specifically so my kids could go to 
                          Sangster. I'd be disappointed to be forced to attend a different school with no choice. 
                         Although I actually selected changing the school bell schedules to accommodate more students, I don’t 
                          really know how much of an impact that will make. I would prefer boundary changes if we can ensure it’s 
                          not always the same students/schools being affected by the boundary changes. 
                         Although my daughter is enjoying Cooper Middle School so far, we were very disappointed with the 
                          boundary change. We purchased our home 9 years ago so she would go to Longfellow and McLean. Neither 
                          school is closeby, but that was our plan. Our area NEEDS a new middle and high school. 
                         Always consider proximity to school or high school. Homes were chosen b/c of this. 
                         Always consider working parents; distance to school, logistics & social effect on kids for every single change 
                          in school is made in their life. Thank you. 
                         Always delay a required change in boundaries for at least 4 years following public notification so that a 
                          student can complete that school without having to change. At that point parents will have had the 
                          notification well in advance.

                                                                                         FAIRFAX SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIALS 
                         Ample notification must be given. Once a student is in the pyramid, cannot be kicked out.All schools are 
                          too crowded so more building needs to occur. Low enrollment schools could over office space for itinerants 
                          working out of hallways. Each pyramid should have their own AAP programs.  
                         Annandale high school is incredibly far (over 25 minutes) from our neighborhood. It is outrageous to think 
                          that this is the pyramid we follow given there are closer high schools within the proximity of where we live.  
                         Another option for what should be the highest priority to address schools that do not have enough students 
                          to fill  all  classrooms? Would be to allow families at over populated schools the option to attend less 
                          populated school; & less populated school should include additional special programs. 
                         Any boundary change should be announced at least one year out before change is made, so families are 
                          aware when purchasing a home or moving. Parents want choices to give their kids access to special 
                          programs like the Academies. Assigned schools impact real estate considerations. 
                         Any boundary change should be done with the minimal disruption to the students 
                         Any boundary changes must be carefully considered, comprehensive (not piecemeal) and undertaken in 
                          ways that minimize the impact to current students and families attending any school or school pyramid 
                          subject to a boundary change (e.g., slowly phased in, allow current students to be grandfathered) 
                         Any boundary discussion should not be influenced by race, religion or economic factors. Students should 
                          not be shuffled to schools further away from their place of residence. Parent participation in schools is so 
                          important and the further they have to go to participate the less they will. 
                         Any boundary that is redrawn that moves my children from the school and pyramid we are currently in will 
                          result in us moving our family. We will sell before we allow FCPS to reassign or move my kids. 
                         Any change in boundary should be accomplished by providing a comparable option for the impacted 
                          students to move to. Otherwise FCPS will be gambling with students educational growth. 
                         Any change must consider the effect on students’ friendships, transportation cost and the level of additional 
                          impact on the already overloaded traffic  
                         Any issues with excess students should be addressed by adding more infrastructure in their areas. Less 
                          students is always preferable for better education! 
                         Any policy (or policy change) should also include the needs of siblings in different grades who should not 
                          be split up or sent to different schools based on some arbitrary timeline for when a change might take 
                          effect. 
                         Any student already attending should have choice to stay in that school. 
                         Any  students  currently  attending  schools  that  might  be  affected  by  boundary  changes  should  be 
                          grandfathered in to the current schools they are attending. Also, suggesting looking at schools that are 
                          closer to specific neighborhoods should be taken into consideration 
                         As a hispanic American, I do NOT believe in boundary changes. I have paid a lot of money for my tiny house 
                          for my kids to go to the LA. Instead of spending so much money on these survey use it on education of kids.  
                         As a military family who move often there should never be a boundary change that would require student 
                          to move during high school. There should be rules in place to avoid this.  
                         As a military family, an additional school change within an already short time in the area could be very 
                          challenging. Also, homes are purchased based on specific school. Some boundary changes could decrease 
                          the value of a home a put families in bad financial situations if needed to sell property.

                                                                                         FAIRFAX SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIALS 
                         As a military family, we are used to changing schools. We do not see a problem with changing school 
                          boundaries and the families having to respond the next school year--kids are adaptable. 
                         As a retiring military family who bought a home primarily because to zoning, being shifted to a new school 
                          is beyond frustrating. Having lived in several states and experiencing several school districts, re-zoning 
                          hasn’t worked to alleviate overcrowding.  
                         As an employee, this needs to happen. There are too many students not wanting to attend their assigned 
                          school, which overcrowds the others. 
                         As best possible, keep a high school pyramid intact, as in all schools in a pyramid feed one high school. My 
                          child's elementary and middle both fed multiple high schools. Increase school diversity where possible (e.g. 
                          not creating undue transportation burdens on students.)  
                         As both a teacher & parent, the boundaries do not make sense to me. For example, there is a HS 5-minutes 
                          from our home, and yet our daughters are zoned for a HS 20-minutes away. Also, the school I teach at is 
                          ridiculously overcrowded while the neighboring schools are under capacity. 
                         As Fairfax County looks to increase population density along the Silver Line, it will be increasingly important 
                          to manage enrollment in the schools most likely to the affected by this growth. Data from Google Maps 
                          should be used to analyze traffic patterns to develop compact school boundaries.  
                         As I'm sure you're aware, people plan long-term and purchase homes based on the schools their children 
                          are zoned to attend. If you come in and change that every few years, even every 5-10 years, it is creating 
                          complete upheaval for families, students, neighborhoods, and has other negative effects. 
                         As is the case with my family. We specifically looked at homes that included the schools that we wanted 
                          our children to attend therefore I do think that it is fair for current students to have to change schools if 
                          boundary changes occur. I believe it should be a choice.  
                         As much as it can be understood why the boundaries must be reset, other options must be exhausted 
                          (expanding current school sizes and minimizing the transfers). People buy real estate based on a school 
                          district. Relocating for many might not be possible or fair.  
                         As much as possible, boundary changes should be prospective and not apply to students currently in the 
                          system so they are not disruptive to their friendship networks. I support building new, or repurposing 
                          existing, capacity to rebalance spatially.  
                         As people have invested a lot in choosing where they live, boundary change should be the last resort. There 
                          are many things that can be done first. 
                         As someone who values community, it is frustrating that my children do. It attend schools with other 
                          neighborhood children. This makes it difficult to collaborate with families on carpool and other community 
                          engagement. There are FOUR elementary schools in our neighborhood alone.  
                         As stated above, I feel strongly that students who are in Middle and High School when boundary changes 
                          are decided should be allowed to remain in their Middle and High school. Any change should occur starting 
                          with Elementary students as they finish Elementary School and or move into Middle School.  
                         As the house cost is dependent on the high school boundaries, the changes must be announced several 
                          years in advance (e.g. 5), and must be done with comparative high schools.  
                         As usual FCPS is clever by not providing all of the information and/or crafting surveys to reach their desired 
                          end states no matter how the survey is answered.  
                         Assess how Loudoun County is handling. With all the new housing development, they have done a great job 
                          a creating new schools.

                         Assigned school can also impact the value of a home. Many parents factored this in when making a 
                          purchasing decision. Moreover, if a boundary change decreases the value of a home it also decreases the 
                          property taxes paid to the schools and a corresponding increase in other homes is not certain. 
                         At this point I don't care how it happens, but Robinson, is horrendously overcrowded. Either move students 
                          out, or build real school additions instead of endless temporary buildings. Ideally, our area needs a new 
                          high school. Or build a middle school and use Robinson for HS only. 
                         At this time there should not be any consideration to change school boundaries. Regardless when these 
                          changes get implemented, COVID has put enough stress on everyone to last for a while. Do not add more 
                          stress to parents or children by having them change schools. 
                         Attendance islands are atrocious. Annandale HS had recent boundary changes. One rumor mill item was to 
                          distribute athletes to other schools. We lost the more affluent families who are involved in the kids' 
                          educations, attend and organize functions, drive kids to practices & know to be the advocates 
                         Attendance islands should not happen-- they are embarrassing since it is obvious they are created for 
                          racial/socioeconomic exclusion.  
                         Aumentar tambien autobuses ,en este tiempo,por la pandemia del covid,y aparte del motorista,debe ir otra 
                          persona mayor responsable para controlar el comportamiento de los estudiantes en el mismo. 
                         Avoid boundary changes as it leads to kids losing friends and homes losing value. School diversity matters.  
                         Avoid Federal and State attempts to influence demographics in such a way as to import non-residents of 
                          the area.  
                         Avoid increasing real estate taxes in order to build new schools if that course of action the board decides 
                         Avoid making changes that diminish property values.  
                         Avoid over crowd in each school, boundary changes based on population and new constructions. Increase 
                          boundary limits to less crowded schools.  
                         avoid splitting neighborhoods into two different districts 
                         Avoiding moving students from a familiar school to a new one should be a priority. Keep siblings together.  
                         Base schools on proximity to the school  
                         Based on my experience with our zoning (moved from Floris to oak hill without moving into the Chantilly 
                          high school pyramid), this whole process is a joke and I don’t believe for one second the school board will 
                          take our viewpoints into account. At the end of the day our elected official didn’t care 
                         Based on the live zoom polls from the boundary meeting on Monday it is clear that boundary changes are 
                          not needed and high majority opposes it. Those polls show how to adequately handle over/under crowding 
                          that does not include boundary changes. People choose where to live bc of schools they want.  
                         Be clear to parents what us changing. Most of us don't have time to read 100 plus pages or go to school 
                          board meetings. Give us the bottom line up front. 
                         Be  considerate  to  those  who  spent  their  savings  to  move  to  strong  academic  centers.  Address  the 
                          inconvenient truth that underperforming schools have a lot to do with lack of parental involvement. Direct 
                          resources there to help the community but don’t use other children as pawns. 
                         Be patient. Slower approach to implementing boundary changes reduces resistance. Avoid having younger 
                          children attending different schools than older siblings. Enable kids to change schools early voluntarily.

                                                                                         FAIRFAX SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIALS 
                         Be proactive. If there aren’t schools, then new residential development shouldn’t happen. Small community 
                          schools preferred over large schools with classes > 15-20 students. All students should be served in base 
                          schools rather than be bused elsewhere, otherwise you’ve lost <˜community’. 
                         Because many families buy homes based on school boundaries, they should not be changed for students 
                          who are currently enrolled. Some students experience a large amount of transition in their lives, so finding 
                          a pyramid or school (with friends!) that is stable is important. 
                         Being a teacher in a neighboring district, do not provide transportation to alternate placements. Busing 
                          should be reserved for neighborhood schools. 
                         Being mindful of peer groups should be of high priority. For certain schools (ex. Bren Mar Park), children 
                          will go to middle school and form new friendships, only to be separated from all other middle school peers 
                          (except for fellow BMP kids) when entering HS. 
                         Being new to Virginia, our kids attend Fox Mill Elementary but live outside the school border. They attend 
                          bec. of the immersion program. It makes no sense that my kids who live further from the school have to 
                          drive in and the people who live in the neighborhood get bused in. It should be switched. 
                         Belle Haven Elementary low number of students, still expanded with construction. Fort Belvoir added an 
                          elementary school, still built a new elementary school in that area. Two examples of not being good 
                          stewards of tax payer dollars, even if already voted for, officials should have been leaders. 
                         Besides overcrowding in classrooms halls and stairwells are packed and what I consider unsafe. Pushing and 
                          kids standing in the way making things even worse. Fire drills should be done between classes to really see 
                          how things would go down in an emergency. 
                         Best to adjust school boundaries every year, let students know what school they will attend in the summer, 
                          and work very hard to ensure equivalence in all schools in terms of quality of instruction and access to 
                          special programs and classes. Make all schools into equivalent platforms to access FCPS 
                         Better balance in school boundaries. Kids shouldn't have to ride 20 or more minutes to another school much 
                          farther away when there is a school that is much closer and would be much easier to get to. 
                         Better partnership between residential and commercial developers with the county school planning and as 
                          a  source  for  funding  schools  as  population  density  increases  with  development.  This  would  include 
                          additional schools and raising teacher salaries. 
                         Bottom line is that I do not want my kids going to a different school than the ones they are going. I 
                          specifically bought my house in this location to give them these schools 
                         Boundaries change must not affect the existing students 
                         Boundaries  have  been  changed  due  to  parents'  complaints  that  are  based  on  misinformation  and 
                          unfounded opinions. Many people believe a school isn't as good if the student population is mostly made 
                          up of minorities. 
                         Boundaries  issues  are  incredibly  challenging.  We  need  to  have  advance  planning  to  ensure  we  are 
                          anticipating population increases, & ensure that we balance diversity w/ allowing children to stay w/in their 
                          community & peer group. Eg. Children who live in W. Springfield, attend school there, etc. 
                         Boundaries must be addressed to reduce overcrowding at McLean. Development is higher in McLean 
                          neighborhoods than Langley, and some students need to be shifted from McLean to Langley to provide a 
                          better learning environment for McLean HS students.

                                                                                         FAIRFAX SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIALS 
                         Boundaries need to make sense, plain and simple. The way some of the boundaries are drawn now were 
                          the results of strong advocating from certain parents. Specialized programs need to be kept to a minimum 
                          and students need to stay at their base schools as much as possible. 
                         Boundaries needs to consider online/remote learning. 
                         Boundaries should apply to WHEN the family occupied the house they currently occupy. For instance, if you 
                          buy a house intending to go to a particular set of schools, but your children are not in school yet, that family 
                          should be grandfathered in based on when they moved into the house. 
                         Boundaries should be adjusted to spread kids evenly throughout the district. Socio-economic diversity 
                          should not be a consideration; keep it focused on logistics, transportation, and avoid over-crowding. 
                         Boundaries should be based on proximity to the school. For example: there are homes that are right off of 
                          Fox Mill Rd that go to Hunters Woods, but they are right next to Crossfield.  
                         Boundaries should be reviewed and adjusted every 10 years - just like the census. 
                         Boundaries  should  encompass  a  range  of  incomes  and  ethnicities  to  reduce  disparities  in  access  to 
                          education 
                         Boundaries should include a diversity of housing. <Neighborhood= schools may perpetuate discrimination, 
                          racism and classism. Ex. Lemon Road ES doesn’t have any apartment complexes within its boundaries. The 
                          community is small and almost all families are wealthy single family homeowners.  
                         Boundaries should make geographic sense, to avoid busing kids all over. Special programs should be located 
                          throughout the county, also to avoid busing kids all over. Current FCPS families need several years' notice / 
                          grace period before change is enforced. 
                         Boundaries  should  not  be  considered  only  for  <preferred=  zip  codes  in  order  to  promote  a  more 
                          homogeneous student environment. Stay inclusive! 
                         Boundaries should not be gerrymandered. Property values should not be a factor when education budget 
                          is allocated equally among all schools. Attendance islands should be eliminated completely.  
                         Boundaries should only be changed to move kids from an overpopulated school, if construction is not an 
                          option to increase that school's capacity. Boundary changes should not be utilized to improve a school's 
                          testing performance or artificially create a racially diverse grouping of students.  
                         Boundaries should reflect proximity to school and not political or parent agendas. If schools are not large 
                          enough to house the population they should be expanded with additional construction to increase capacity.  
                         Boundaries should remain stable for 5-10 years so that students are not constantly being shifted. Split 
                          feeders should be eliminated. Once boundaries are changed students should have the choice to switch 
                          pyramids immediately, and not be forced to complete 8th grade in one pyramid before moving. 
                         Boundary and Zip code should be eliminated Good stem programs and other programs should be there in 
                          equality in every school.  
                         Boundary assessment should look closely at why certain neighborhood schools have more transfer / 
                          reassignment requests than others. High # of requests based on real or perceived differences in quality of 
                          education need to be addressed. Getting to root cause of discrepancies hould be top priority.  
                         Boundary change should also look at the economic impact such as change in school boundaries will impact 
                          housing prices negatively  
                         Boundary change should be announced 3-5 years in adance to give sufficient time for parents to take the 
                          decision to move house if needed.

                                                                                         FAIRFAX SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIALS 
                         Boundary change should not occur, change or be pursued under the umbrella of the Critical Race Theory 
                          initiative in VA and FCPS, as well as One Fairfax initiative in FCPS. Boundary change will not fundamentally 
                          improve the performance of poor schools nor doesn't help those students who need help. 
                         Boundary change should not occur, it effects all of us. We currently moved to a new house so our kids can 
                          go to the good school district and we do not approve of this.  
                         Boundary change shouldn’t result in attendance at lower rated pyramid, if possible, since so much of 
                          property value is connected to that. If it is similar level, then it should be less of a problem. 
                         Boundary changes are a sensitive subject for students and parents. Changes to the boundary should impact 
                          any student not currently in the school. Students in the school should be given the opportunity to complete 
                          their education at the current school. New/Rising students should follow boundaries 
                         Boundary changes are dangerous as so much rests on the school. People buy homes based on where the 
                          school is and any change could tank property values. Just increase the opportunities at all schools - put AAP 
                          programs everywhere. 
                         Boundary changes are extremely fraught and emotional issues. All efforts should be made to AVOID 
                          boundary changes and more choice given to families first before moving children to different schools.  
                         Boundary changes are fine if they make sense, but our impression is that there is far too much focus and 
                          attention on the topic of 'diversity'. We need common sense solutions to deliver the best education to all 
                          of our students and reduce transportation burdens in our already congested area. Thanks 
                         Boundary changes are hard. We should consider the least disruption to student life while also addressing 
                          future impact. Enrollment ebbs and flows. Anticipate. Don't make changes that will simply have to be 
                          redone in a few years.  
                         Boundary changes are idiotic and short sighted. With the rapid growth of new developments, underutilized 
                          schools can quickly become over crowded and vice versa. Leave existing boundaries alone.  
                         Boundary changes are necessary as the population increases. Paying attention to diversity and inclusion is 
                          essential.  
                         Boundary changes are necessary, but many people make home location decisions so that their kids can 
                          attend particular schools, and so boundary changes should be a last resort. I don't think trailers are a big 
                          deal and may be a better solution if feasible. 
                         Boundary changes are never easy, but people also need to understand they're necessary in an area with 
                          such high growth rates. 
                         Boundary changes are not the solution. Drawing lines on a map impacts families that have moved to a 
                          specific location based on the assigned school pyramid. Boundary changes force a devaluation to properties 
                          that have a boundary change from a preferred school.  
                         Boundary changes are unfair to families who look forward to their children attending a certain school 
                          pyramid. Kids already in the pyramid should not be displaced. 
                         Boundary changes are very disruptive. I think the most effort should be put into keeping kids in their current 
                          pyramids.  Adding resources to schools with high demand makes the most sense. 
                         Boundary changes are WORSE than the pandemic for kids. Don't impact current students with changes. 
                         Boundary changes can have significant effects on a home's property value. We specially bought our home 
                          because of the highly rated school pyramid it's located in. Please consider that families make these choices 
                          when it comes to a child's education.

                                                                                         FAIRFAX SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIALS 
                         Boundary changes deeply anger and divide communities and we already have enough of that in society. I 
                          am against using political and social justice motives as guiding factors. Please use transportation and 
                          enrollment as your guidance.  
                         Boundary changes deeply anger and divide communities; we already have enough of that in society. Stop 
                          trying to cover up achievement gaps caused by FCPS policy by making kids suffer emotionally by switching 
                          schools. Kids should attend their neighborhood schools and not sit on a bus countless hours. 
                         Boundary changes do you not solve problems they create them. Children should go to school in their own 
                          neighborhoods. If the county is seeking to help struggling schools resources need to be diverted to those 
                          schools to support them. Over development is a huge problem. build houses = build schools. 
                         Boundary changes have a significant impact on families that have purchased homes in a particular pyramid 
                          based on the schools in that pyramid. Please do not disregard the careful planning and investments families 
                          make in this regard.  
                         Boundary changes hurt families and students.  
                         Boundary  changes  may  have  severe  impact  to  property  values.  You  should  consider  the  impact  to 
                          communities before making any changes.  
                         Boundary changes must be open for public discussion so those in charge listen and learn from  those 
                          affected. New schools should be made for the best interests of students, not dog park preservation. Many 
                          don’t trust the board or admins for many good reasons. 
                         Boundary changes separate family members, neighbors, and can divide communities. They affect house 
                          prices and should be taken with the utmost care. They should generally be avoided. 
                         Boundary changes should always be for the next school year, and ONLY affect students who are already 
                          changing schools (new students and students transitioning to middle or high school) 
                         BOUNDARY CHANGES SHOULD BA A LAST RESORT, and only to reduce overcrowding when no other options 
                          are  available.  Rather  than  changing  boundaries,  elective  changes  or  specialized  programs  should  be 
                          relocated to balance enrollment, but only when there is no other option to elliminate overcrowding.  
                         Boundary changes should be advised to the public far in advance to allow for parents and county to 
                          coordinate properly, and not two weeks before schools start.  
                         Boundary Changes should be an absolute last step measure, use funds to increase facilities if needed. As 
                          more and more people continue to move away specifically because of FCPS continued failure close the 
                          schools and relocate those as necessary. 
                         Boundary changes should be announced at least two years before they become official. 
                         Boundary changes should be avoided at all cost. The only reason for a boundary change should be with the 
                          addition of a new school and then students should rise into the school. Boundary changes are too disruptive 
                          and upsetting for students and parents as well. 
                         Boundary changes should be based on data and facts, and not on the whim of a school board member, such 
                          as when Kathy Smith moved all the ESOL students from Poplar Tree ES to Virginia Run ES so the numbers of 
                          her district would improve. This took students out of a familiar environment, for her ego. 
                         Boundary changes should be carefully considered. There are educational impacts for the students as well 
                          as home values in a high cost of living area.  
                         Boundary changes should be considered as necessary but enrollment should be reviewed no more than 
                          every three years. Boundary changes should start with the schools that are the most overcrowded (at each 
                          level) in mind. New schools should be built to assist in overcrowding areas.

                                                                                         FAIRFAX SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIALS 
                         Boundary changes should be limited. The focus should be on prioritizing building new facilities in areas with 
                          higher growth. Way less anger from people unhappy with boundary changes. 
                         Boundary changes should be made with COMMON SENSE. They must not driven by social justice or politics 
                          that will only add fuel to the fire in today's divisive society. Our kids don't need that. The LHS border is 
                          insane. Many are closer to Herndon and South Lakes. Make the case on transportation. 
                         Boundary changes should be minimized, but are a necessary part of a dynamic community. Appropriate 
                          planning should take place to adjust as a whole, piecemeal changes create more problems and logistical 
                          considerations. 
                         Boundary changes should be minimized, with the exception of new school construction.  
                         Boundary changes should be rare and a result of a long-term change in population. Keeping consistency for 
                          families already in school is also important.  
                         Boundary changes should be rare and LAST option. We bought home 20 years ago for specific pyramid. 
                          Oldest child a senior at high school which was major factor in purchasing our home. Boundaries should be 
                          compact and student travel minimized. 
                         Boundary changes should be rare and only absolutely necessary because parents purchase homes based 
                          on school pyramids.  
                         Boundary changes should be reviewed but should not make it harder or longer for students to get to school. 
                          Schools should be part of their neighborhood. 
                         Boundary changes should go into affect for only new students/families entering the pyramid only, it 
                          students/families already part a pyramid. having kids continuously move whenever a boundary decision is 
                          made is extremely disruptive and unnecessary  
                         Boundary changes should have been done a long time ago. FCPS should not have a school like Waynewood 
                          elementary in 2021. They call it Whitewood for a reason. FCPS should be ashamed.  
                         Boundary  changes  should  include  the  PTA  and  PTSA  having  input  and  an  open  forum  to  see  the 
                          individualized needs of each school and to find the best means to incorporate change in a way that will 
                          promote student growth. 
                         Boundary changes should minimize disruption on families and as such minimize pyramid shifts. For school 
                          under capacity the obvious 1st step is to eliminate trailers. Split feeders are not good for kids and should 
                          be minimized.  
                         Boundary changes should never affect those currently enrolled. What a mental health disaster that would 
                          be.  
                         Boundary changes should never be changed - create neighborhood schools so kids can grow up with their 
                          friends and not be shuffled around like a bunch of animals  
                         Boundary changes should not be mandatory for students/families currently enrolled in FCPS; students have 
                          already started their FCPS journey and parents purchased homes based on certain expectations; any 
                          changes should be prospective to families that have not yet started in FCPS. 
                         Boundary changes should not be politically or socially motivated.  
                         Boundary changes should not effect students whose parents were members of the cluster prior to the 
                          change. Once the boundary changes it should be new students and forward that should change. Do not 
                          force students to ride busses for a lengthy commute when they live closer to their original school. 
                         Boundary changes should not happen to the extent that you have kids changing schools every few years.

                                                                                         FAIRFAX SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIALS 
                         Boundary changes should not happen very often. Bussing students from all over the county to their school 
                          is lucrative and a waste of time that could be spent on education. Students need to stick to the schools that 
                          are closest in proximity to their home.  
                         Boundary changes should occur as needed only and if it reduces distance and time traveling for students to 
                          their base school. We live 7 miles from our high school which is still quite puzzling, given that FIVE FCPS 
                          schools are actually closer to us. No one has ever been able to explain truly why! 
                         boundary changes should only apply to new students 
                         Boundary changes should only be considered with newly built neighborhoods and not have that new 
                          construction affect older neighborhood boundary lines and keep boundaries the same for those areas that 
                          have had established boundaries for 20+ years. Unless, residents are pushing for boundary changes. 
                         Boundary changes should only be done when absolutely necessary, not on an arbitrary schedule. In this 
                          horrifically expensive county, people cannot just move to be in a school of choice. Focus should be on 
                          making all existing schools high quality. 
                         Boundary  changes  should  only  be  done  when  necessary.  Changing  for  the  sake  of  changing  is  not 
                          appropriate.  
                         Boundary changes should reflect the best options for student enrollment, student learning, proximity, and 
                          social development. Boundary changes should also evaluate available resources, such as physical building 
                          capacity, teacher-student ratio, and safety. 
                         Boundary changes should start with new students. Families can choose to move to new school.  
                         Boundary changes should take into account equity.  
                         Boundary changes shouldn't incur additional costs to the system as a whole if options are given to remain 
                          with the old school, transportation should be provided by the parents. 
                         Boundary changes will probably occur and they will be made political. Such a shame. Let these kids be kids. 
                          Stop with the political agenda and focus on the children 
                         Boundary changes wreak havoc on families, property values, etc. They should be avoided whenever 
                          possible. And anyone initially in the boundary should always stay. Home purchase decisions are often made 
                          based on schools. 
                         Boundary decisions should not be political. Should focus on students needs and keeping communities 
                          together. From personal experience living a split community and kids being split after ES is not great.  
                         Boundary lines for Fairfax High school are very dated and do not reflect the growth that has occurred in the 
                          county. It is crazy that my child will have to commute for 30-40 minutes to school one way when there is a 
                          high school 2 miles from our home.  
                         Boundary policy needs to consider proposed as well as approved new housing, in order to have foresight. 
                         Boundary policy should be decided solely on number of students in each school/ overpopulation. Never on 
                          race or socioeconomic factors! 
                         Boundary policy should be not be influenced and impacted by any "political correctness".  Any school board 
                          policy/action is to serve the students and parents better, not for the politicians or political part's agenda. 
                         Boundary policy will never help as parents prefer to send their kids to good Schools where the kids get 
                          challenging environment and where people of diversity lives as this give kids to intellectually grow faster. 
                          Plus the school rating matters the most.  
                         Boundary should not be changed

                                                                                         FAIRFAX SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIALS 
                         Boundery shold be set by the number of residants not by the number of houses 
                         Boundry changes are a terrible idea. I think it makes parents much less involved with their childs education, 
                          less likely to attend parent/teacher conf., join PTA, attend school events, etc., if their kids attend a school 
                          45 minutes away by bus.  
                         Build better and more schools where students live. I’d rather pay more taxes for good education a smarter 
                          society is cheaper in the long run.  
                         Build extra revenue by allowing charter schools to rent unused classrooms. Bring true equity to minority 
                          students by giving them school choice. 
                         Build more schools in high growth areas. Current schools have room to build outdoor classrooms or theater. 
                          Expand side walks and bike lanes (we have a 1200 ft part on old mill road without a side walk! We could 
                          walk to school but that small part of road is dangerous). Thank you FCPS!" 
                         Build new schools for areas where heavy trailer use is prevalent. Not only are they uncomfortable and 
                          inconvenient for all, but they’re an eye sore. Trash. 
                         Build new schools where the demand is. 
                         Building more schools is necessary and better as they will also creat more jobs for teachers 
                         Building schools require a 5-10 year lead time, and is therefore not responsive to pressing problems. 
                          Boundary decisions should be made more frequently and decisively to meet students' academic needs. 
                         Bus travel time should be proportionate to student age - elementary kids should have shortest routes. 
                          Elementary and Middle School boundaries should keep children in the same high school pyramid. When 
                          you build schools, build them bigger or add to the existing school structure. No temp buildings! 
                         Busing doesn’t work, has never worked, will never work 
                         Bussing kids to try to create diversity will only cause more headache and problems for all residents in the 
                          county. Reduce bussing. People choose pyramids for a reason when selecting their homes. I think continuity 
                          from K-12 would make FCPS stronger.  
                         Bussing should be a last-resort solution to increasing diversity. Working families should have access to high 
                          quality  and  specialized  education  within  a  reasonable  commute.  Proximity  aids  a  feeling  of  cultural 
                          belonging and can help sustain the development of lifelong friendships. 
                         Came from MD where neighborhood schools and HS pyramid was dismantled in favor of lottery system. 
                          Degraded parent participation at all levels. And eroded community bonds. MoCo dropped from top MD 
                          county to mid pack based on these policies. Keep schools tied to community. Better for kids. 
                         Case by case basis also needs to be considered. Mainly for those students that are close to complete 
                          elementary, middle or high school. An assessment of the population density vs. the local schools per 
                          neighborhood should be done periodically. 
                         Chang boundary for improvement school rating  
                         Change boundaries to reflect geographic clusters (not aged remote school islands such as those along RT 
                          7). Realign boundaries to fully utilize existing Fcps buildings first PRIOR to new construction.  
                         Change is hard for children. This area has a lot of families that travel for their jobs and being able to stay on 
                          their schools that they are currently assigned.  
                         Change middle school boundary to one mile or less for walkers.  
                         Change would be a little easier if made during students transitions to middle and high school

                                                                                         FAIRFAX SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIALS 
                         Changes can be hard for young students. Keeping a group/neighborhood of students together through a 
                          boundary change would keep it fair and grouped with the same peers they have previously attended school 
                          with.  
                         changes in boundary for high school students is likely me have me withdraw my children from FCPS 
                         "Changes in school boundaries increase the time on the bus, separate neighborhoods and friends. Not the 
                          ans.  The  projection  has  always  been  off  in  fairfax  county  for  school  growth,  hence  Westfield  was 
                          overcrowded b4 it opened!!!! HSers have been through enough. New Boundaries start with freshman. 
                         Changes made now should not change the base school for the currently enrolled students, but only the new 
                          students. Current students should have an option to move or stay with the current school assignment  
                         Changes should be infrequent and should be optional for students already enrolled in a school/pyramid. I 
                          can’t imagine there are a lot of underenrolled schools in the county, so focus on making the existing schools 
                          serve the populations they have rather than redrawing lines. 
                         Changes should be made to the incoming grades so it is gradual and students can finish out at their 
                          school.This could affect siblings but I think that is okay. Exceptions should be made centrally with good 
                          reasons and should not be at principal discretion.  
                         Changes to boundaries must be phased in over a long period of time with clearly stated rules and options. 
                          Flexibility for families already in a school is important. I wouldn't want my kindergartener in one place and 
                          my fourth grader in another. 
                         Changes to school boundaries is not as easy as busing the child to another, further school. Parents purchase 
                          homes based on schools, have friends/family established, routines/schedules established that it will be 
                          difficult for a change in schools.  
                         Changes to the boundaries should be effective 3-5 years from now. Many families move to specific 
                          neighborhoods for their children to attend specific schools. Change the boundary is unfair to those who 
                          moved for the schools. 
                         Changes to traffic patterns around the schools whose boundaries are being changed. 
                         Changing boundaries are extremely disruptive and hurt student education for students who are currently 
                          in a base school. Please think carefully about the children.  
                         Changing boundaries causes stress to families, because many chose their location based on the schools 
                          their kids would attend. If a school is too full, offer options or incentives for the students at those schools 
                          to move to another. School populations change often, less drastic option is best. 
                         Changing boundaries during these unprecedented times will create a panic-stricken community when 
                          change is constant and unpredictable these last 3 years. Create more classrooms and construction for 
                          schools that need increase. 
                         Changing boundaries is a very difficult topic, especially when parents purchase homes based on a school 
                          district, would recommend changing boundaries only when absolutely necessary and not in a routine basis.  
                         Changing boundaries is not fair on parents who have paid premium price for buying houses that fed into 
                          particular desirable high schools.  
                         Changing boundaries is very frustrating when people purchase homes based on the schools <= what ever 
                          their reasons are. The <emotional well-being= of children should be the main focus. Changing their schools 
                          is huge. Huge unfair impact.

                                                                                         FAIRFAX SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIALS 
                         Changing  boundaries  should  be  the  absolute  last  resort.  People  buy  their  houses  based  on  the 
                          neighborhood schools and changing boundaries can reduce property values. Also, sending students to 
                          schools outside their neighborhoods doesn't help to build a strong community. 
                         Changing boundaries will be a terrible thing for housing prices in a specific area. We bought our home 
                          because of how good Oak View Elementary is. It would be a disgrace if we had to switch schools.  
                         Changing boundary can dramatically impact the values of the properties involved and change the residents 
                          demography. Improper changes can trigger the angers and untrust due to the loss of assets and loss of 
                          quality of education.  
                         Changing boundary will create unnecessary stress for the families and children in particular. Instead of 
                          redrawing the boundaries every several years, perhaps the schools could expand by constructing additional 
                          buildings/wings, not temporary trailers that become permanent.   
                         Changing of school should only be done prior to entering into the next school. Meaning once in high school 
                          as a freshman don’t change that student for the next three years. Same for middle school.  
                         Changing school boundaries affect many other things - House pricing, neighborhood crime rates, child’s 
                          mental health. When we buy the house, we pay a huge price on the house depending on the school pyramid. 
                          Changing the base school can affect that poorly.  
                         Changing school boundaries can be very disruptive. It should be done only when absolutely necessary.  
                         Changing school boundaries doesn't change the demand of bus drivers, reference Maslow's Hierarchy of 
                          Needs. Overpopulation in schools, it's cheaper to create additional structures vice purchasing additional 
                          land and buildings especially with the limited available land in Fairfax County.  
                         Changing school boundaries has a massive impact on families, children, and neighborhoods. It is almost 
                          never a good idea.  
                         Changing school boundaries shouldn't be applied to existing students unless opted into. It can be isolating 
                          and traumatic to have your life uprooted during such pivotal years, and unfair to force these changes on 
                          students without option.  
                         Changing the boundary and requiring a family to move their child to another school would be unfair as 
                          many people move to certain places based on the school boundaries. At the least, give them the option to 
                          be "grandfathered" in to attend their originally designated schools.  
                         Changing the school pyramid within a family would be emotional and disruptive. This should not be forced 
                          for any students already in school. 
                         changing Thomas Jefferson magnet enrollment to percentage by school may already encourage people to 
                          move. But many of us bought houses based on the high school pyramid and a boundary change can impact 
                          our property values.  
                         Chantilly HS is too crowded at 4000 students, rezoning is a band aid that will not stick for long. New schools 
                          need constructed as this area is growing. Allowing non-area kids to attend is also not helping.  
                         Child currently attends SPED preschool. The school is down the street from our house. We are zoned to go 
                          to another school quite a bit from our house starting next year. How does that make sense? 
                         Children already in an existing school should not be made to transfer to a new school.  
                         Children likes to stay in the same school that they have been established routines, closed friends, classmates 
                          and feel comfortable with the familiar teachers. Unless it's the last resource that school has to be changed, 
                          no parent nor child would want to change school.

                         children should attend elementary schools closest to their homes; all kids from a particular elementary 
                          school should then progress to same middle/high school do not split up elementary schools. 
                         Children should be able to attend school with the same group of children from elementary school through 
                          Highschool.  
                         Children should be permitted to remain with their classmates with transportation provided whenever 
                          possible. 
                         Children should go to school in their neighborhood schools. If I wanted to disrupt my child’s relationship 
                          with their school, friends and teachers I would have moved last year. If you make my boundary where my 
                          child has to take a school bus for a half hour or something dumb I’ll move.  
                         Children should go to their closest school, with the exception of AAP or Immersion opportunities. Kids do 
                          not need to riding the bus for extended times when it's avoidable.  
                         Children should never be moved from the base school in their neighborhood. Parents chose their housing 
                          based on the schools provided and children should not be forced into a school in a different area based on 
                          their ethnicity, color of their skin, language spoke or their socio-economic status. 
                         Children should never be pulled from their current schools to accommodate boundary changes. If a specific 
                          school is becoming too crowded due to rapid, poorly planned construction in certain communities, the NEW 
                          students coming into the district should have to go elsewhere.  
                         Children should not have to be in a bus unnecessarily. If their home is walkable to a school, they should not 
                          be sent to a school farther away. Find a better way to do this. 
                         Children should not have to ride the bus more than 25-30 minutes to get to or from school.  
                         Children who have an association with school, even if not currently enrolled, should have the option of 
                          staying with that school. 
                         Communication is the biggest concern. No boundary change will make everyone happy, but as much 
                          advanced notice as possible should be provided so that families can make decisions that are best for them. 
                          Recommend one school year of advance notice.  
                         Communication needs to be in advance of the school year (at least 1 year in advance) in order for parents 
                          to make any necessary arrangements with work and programs associated with child care. Families, children 
                          and parents need to be given opportunity to emotionally prepare their children to change 
                         Communities should be diverse and should kept together. This needs to happen at the housing level. If 
                          there are diverse housing options in one community, and all students of that community go to the same 
                          schools, then the schools will be diverse by default. 
                         Community schools are very important because kids can be friends and meet and play in the community 
                          when school is out like during summer 
                         Consider allowing current rising sophomores, juniors, and seniors to finish their high school careers where 
                          they are. It is harder to uproot these students due to college preparation they have already begun 
                         Consider changing the cutoffs between elementary/middle/high school if that helps.  
                         Consider climate change impacts - prioritize walking/biking. For ES attendance islands: don't just look at a 
                          map. You can make two neighborhoods separated by a large artery (i.e. Route 50) go to the same school, 
                          but they still won't feel connected b/c of the impassable road. We are more than a map! 
                         Consider doing away with AAP centers when all feeder school to the center can support LLIV programs.

                                                                                         FAIRFAX SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIALS 
                         Consider that some families purchased their homes with particular schools in mind. Apply new boundaries 
                          to any home purchased after the boundary change. Grandfather existing home owners from before the 
                          change to allow them to choose the old or new pyramid.  
                         Consider the creation of "flexible" boundaries. There are 3 elementary schools in close proximity to our 
                          house. Let parents have a choice where their kids go to school within certain limits (e.g. - schools bordering 
                          their in-bound school). 
                         Consider  the  property  for  Clifton  Elementary  that  has  sat  unused  for  nearly  10  years.  If  not  as  a 
                          neighborhood or magnet school, then at least some alternative use like athletic fields, park or otherwise. 
                          An empty building just sitting there makes no sense. 
                         Consideration should be taken in regards to property values should the possibility of a boundary change re-
                          assign students from a high-performing/rated school pyramid to a lower-performing/rated school pyramid. 
                          Don't negativly impact property values of homes/students moving to a lowe-rated school. 
                         Consideration to traffic patterns, not just bus rides. Considerations to reduced class size /student/teacher 
                          ratios  so  that  differentiation  can  occur  within  classrooms  and  special  programs  are  less  crucial. 
                          Consideration for Special Education Services available. 
                         Considering the impact would be to the students and their families like your own children may have been 
                          impacted.  
                         Consistency for families is important. We trust the education at any FCPS will be great, but allowing 
                          relationships with teachers, counselors, staff and other kids to continue throughout a family is key to 
                          success. Keep kids in current schools when possible. 
                         Construct new schools between the overcrowded schools and the underperforming schools in order to 
                          increase diversity without ripping kids out of their neighborhoods. 
                         Construction/additions to school buildings should be a priority. All trailers should be removed due to safety 
                          of  students  transitioning  from  trailers  to  school  building  and  mold/health  reasons  due  to  declining 
                          conditions of the trailers. Students should be educated in school buildings, not trailers. 
                         Cost should be an important factor. Look for the lowest cost option so more of our tax dollars can be spent 
                          on educating children and less on survey, busing, etc. 
                         Creat more governor schools like TJ. 
                         Create diversity. Some schools only have low income students while other schools only have rich kids.  
                         Create good public education schools/programs for every neighbourhood, class and race! in the region and 
                          country. This will eliminate the need for changing school boundaries. Often parents are forced to buy or 
                          rent close to good schools to provide good education for their children. 
                         Create more magnet schools 
                         create programs that attracts students and have experienced teaching staffs should prioritize over assign 
                          students to far away schools based on boundary change. 
                         Create programs that people want to attend. If you need to reduce High school crowding, create another 
                          TJ option for students to choose to attend. 
                         Creating neighborhood schools will create better communities. Kids with special needs should be included 
                          in ALL schools and be mainstreamed as much as possible so that they're not being bussed to far locations 
                          for a specific program.  
                         Crowded schools and classrooms are hurting our students education and our educators.

                         Current residents of a school zone should never be forced to change schools.  
                         Current students and families should get a choice to stay in their current school or move to the school in 
                          the new boundaries if they are currently enrolled. 
                         Current students at the elementary level should have a choice to remain at their current assigned school 
                          regardless of boundary change. Families choose to purchase and rent homes based on schools.  
                         Current students grandfathered in and choose old or new school; new students entering kindergarten 
                          follow the new boundary schools 
                         Current  students  should  be  able  to  stay  in  their  current  pyramid  because  families  like  ours  moved 
                          specifically where we did because of the neighborhood pyramid.  
                         Current students should be given choices and not disrupted 
                         Current students should be given choices to avoid disruption.  
                         Current students should be given the choice of staying in their current school or moving to the new school. 
                         Current students should have the flexibility to choose. Otherwise, boundary changes should affect incoming 
                          FCPS students. Changes should reflect the population growth in developing areas to reduce commutes for 
                          parents and students. Student drop off for walkers is insanely busy. Add more buses. 
                         Current students should have the option of staying in current pyramid  
                         Current students should not be asked to move schools. Incoming students should be forced to be reassigned 
                          according to the new boundaries.  
                         Current students should not be forced to transfer to new school boundaries, but instead have the option 
                          to remain in their current high school pyramid or transfer to the new one. This is so to not disrupt the social 
                          circles already developed. All new students will follow the new boundaries.  
                         Currently enrolled students should not be forced to move schools. It is disruptive and traumatizing. If our 
                          school boundary is changed, we will pull our child from the FCPS system entirely.  
                         Decisions should be made based on what suits the students academic and social/emotional needs. Trailers 
                          should not be allowed for more than 5 years and only when there are approved plans to get rid of them. 
                          Whether that be by new construction and/or boundary changes.  
                         different fcps MS and HS offer different specialty programs (IB, AP, Academy, etc) but students are not 
                          supported with busing if families opt for a school outside their zone. So it is an issue of bias for those with 
                          time, resources to get their kids to an outside zone school.  
                         Difficult form to fill out. I feel that the options are much more involved than the one liner choices.  
                         Disappointed in fcps. What the -redacted- is latinx? Latinos hate that terminology. Stop being so -redacted- 
                          woke. Can't stand you anymore  
                         Distance from home to school must be considered. Parents and students must have right to choose  
                         Distance from school should be the driving factor. There are neighborhoods that are 2 miles from a high 
                          school that have to travel 8 to get to their assigned. That's brutal on the students and the parents and the 
                          traffic in the area. 
                         districts must be fair. Current zones favor neighborhoods with money. all students in an elementary schools 
                          should attend the same pyramid. 
                         Diversity & students balance enrollment should be the focus.

                         Diversity and equity are of absolute importance, redrawing lines should keep this in mind. Children close to 
                          Vienna or Wolf Trap should not be traveling to McLean HS. The boundaries are overdue for redrawing due 
                          to development and tremendous growth since they were first drawn. No more trailers. 
                         Diversity is important to me, I’m black, my husband is white and our kids are biracial but forcing kids to go 
                          to schools outside of their boundaries for diversity sake is wrong. My mom had to do that in high school 
                          when our town desegregated and it was awful. Bussing doesn’t work. 
                         Diversity needs to be a top priority. Also providing specialized programs in more schools.  
                         Diversity should be major factor when determining boundaries.  
                         Diversity, inclusion and creating a level playing field for all FCPS should be at the forefront. Secondly, people 
                          pay a lot to move to this area for particular schools (and pay taxes accordingly), and that should be 
                          considered in terms of parental preference. Offer amazing programs at all schools. 
                         Diversity/ inclusion should be the top priority. Every school should be able to provide top quality programs 
                          to reduce people wanting to enroll in schools other than their neighborhood school.  
                         Do more long term planning. Communicate more with parents ahead of time.  
                         Do not bus a large amount of kids outside of the boundaries!!! That's serves nothing, but headache.  
                         Do not change boundaries for existing students. you need to give a years notice at the minimum that 
                          boundaries are changing for those who are looking to transfer to the area. I would be upset if I signed a 
                          lease, paid through the nose for rent to go to a certain school to find out later they can’t.  
                         Do not change boundaries.  
                         Do not change boundaries. Build or improve all schools for all students wherever they happen to be. Keep 
                          communities together. 
                         Do not change the boundaries. Expand school facilities with higher student populations. Give option to 
                          attend lower attended school if desired through application process.  
                         Do not change the boundary of school. This is not a communist country. We planned, invested money and 
                          did our very best to send our kids to Langley high school.  
                         Do not change the current boundaries for West Springfield High School. We worked very hard for our 
                          daughter to attended West Springfield High School.  
                         Do not change the school boundary. DO NOT CHANGE THE SCHOOL BONDARY 
                         Do not draw ridiculous boundaries and send kids across town to schools when there are schools closer to 
                          them.  
                         Do not force my child to go to school in a different neighborhood. Make the schools in each neighborhood 
                          and the services provided in each neighborhood better. That way everyone receives equal education and 
                          more people of diverse backgrounds will want to live in each neighborhood.  
                         Do not force students to change for diversity. Do not change Langley pyramid boundary 
                         Do not make any boundary changes. It is unfair for the homeowners. 
                         Do not separate siblings as has happened in the past. It is ridiculous to have the same family at different 
                          schools. 
                         Do not tank high performing schools just to make them more diverse. Do not force kids to bus who could 
                          otherwise walk to school.

                         Do not upend students unless their parents choose the option. 
                         do not use this boundary policy to push race issue and politics  
                         Do not wish to change current boundaries. 
                         Don’t change boundary - overcrowding will balance over time as people move to less crowded areas. It’s 
                          not the school boards responsibility or decision to control population balancing. 
                         Don’t change school boundaries. I bought the house I currently live in for the schools assigned to it. I can’t 
                          afford to move again if you move boundaries. Build additions to the current schools or FIX the bad ones!!! 
                         Don’t change the boundaries  
                         Don’t change the boundaries and update older schools (ie, McLean High School) which provides more space. 
                          Also build additional schools where densely populated structures are being built (ie, tysons corner) 
                         Don’t change the boundaries, change the schools (buildings, staff levels, build new, etc.). 
                         Don’t disrupt kids for this. Don’t use kids as a pawn in some political statement. I was bused as a kid because 
                          of diversity issues in my town and it was traumatic. 
                         Don’t makes changes now. The kids have been through enough with Covid. Let them all remain at their 
                          schools with their friends and teachers for consistency. Many kids will not cope with with a big change like 
                          this.  
                         Don’t move families to a new school or pyramid, ever.  
                         Don’t separate neighborhoods. Assign or give a choice of the school that is closest in distance. My kid is 
                          assigned to robinson but the vast majority of our neighborhood is assigned to liberty. Liberty is 3 min from 
                          home. Robinson is 28 min by car or 55 min by bus. Unacceptable to stay as is  
                         Don’t separate neighborhoods. Students should be assigned to or give a choice of the school that is closest 
                          in distance.  
                         Don’t try to adjust the school boundaries! 
                         Don’t  try  to  change  boundaries  for  <equity  and  diversity  <,  that’s  not  possible  for  the  long  term, 
                          neighborhoods change, new construction, etc. Don’t disrupt people’s lives in the sake of diversity for 
                          diversity’s sake as it’s a pipe dream and not worth wrecking home values and long bus rides.  
                         Don’t  try  to  change  boundaries  for  <equity  and  diversity  <,  that’s  not  possible  for  the  long  term, 
                          neighborhoods change, new construction, etc. Don’t disrupt people’s lives in the sake of diversity for 
                          diversity’s sake as it’s a pipe dream and not worth wrecking home values and long bus rides.  
                         Don't bus kids out of their school to balance other schools. Kids need to stay in the same school, especially 
                          middle and high school. Their foundation and friend base is allready set. It's detrimental to change that 
                         Don't change boundaries. Build more schools. Build less houses. 
                         Don't change boundaries. Instead, build new classrooms and other facilities.  
                         Don't create more problems by making this about diversity rather than actual need. Use the space you have 
                          (even if it means changing boundaries) before building a new school. Think of other options to decrease 
                          overcrowding including virtual learning. 
                         Don't ever do it. People buy homes based on how good schools affect property values. 
                         Don't force current students to a new school. 
                         Don't make students change schools once they've started high school. It's hard enough for them.

                         Don't  think  high  school  students  should  have  to  move  high  schools,  but  perhaps  not  be  offered 
                          transportation to school outside boundary? 
                         Don't waste money! Please focus on how to improve student study performance! 
                         Don't waste my money, please focus on the student's study performance. 
                         Due to fencting or bordering a residentail campus/colony, walking distance from residence to school 
                          increase substantially. hence school is requested to please monitor it,

                         Each school should improve itself instead of redistricting children to lower performing schools and making 
                          those children responsible for improving others' education. We've sacrificed & paid higher taxes to give our 
                          children an opportunity to fulfill their potential in the schools in our district. 
                         Elementary schools shouldn't be included for students already attending that school...too much change for 
                          that age range, consistency is best.  
                         Elementary students should have the OPTION of attending the middle/high school within the closest 
                          proximity of their home. They should be grandfathered in if they choose to be.  
                         Elementary students should HAVE to move to the new school boundary. Middle School questionable. High 
                          Schoolers should have the option to move to new boundary school or stay at the school they have already 
                          started. 
                         Elementary/middle school kids should all go to same high school, there needs to be a high school built near

                         Eliminate  boundary  issues  by  allowing  more  school  choice  in  middle  and  high  school  with  specialty 
                          programs like PWCS 
                         Eliminate special schools for 'gifted and talented", AP, etc. ALL students have gifts and talents - it is an insult 
                          to all students to have these seperate schools and it contributes to social inequities. AP and other programs 
                          need to be incorporated into all schools.  
                         Eliminate students that are not in the base school district (hire staff to confirm residency reqt) we lack in 
                          this area especially with "higher rated/more diserable" schools. We have no clue what the true base is. We 
                          need better measures to truly check otherwise overcrowding will continue despite. 
                         Enforce the rules on illegal multi-family dwellings. These households are only generating one property tax 
                          but are often sending two or three families' worth of kids. The imbalance is killing our school budgets. 
                         Enforcement and compliance must be effective. Several families, especially families unable to afford to live 
                          in the area, use or abuse someone’s address.  
                         enrollment should be evaluated often enough that needed boundary changes can be projected several 
                          years out. This will allow new students enrolling to follow new boundary lines while current students can 
                          have the choice to change or remain.  
                         ensure maximum transparency

                                                                                         FAIRFAX SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIALS 
                         Ensure that affluent neighborhoods (white Vienna parents) are not shielded from the "discomfort" of 
                          boundary changes. These are often the neighborhoods where the parents yell the loudest and usually end 
                          up unscathed while less affluent areas bear the brunt of boundary changes.  
                         Equally distribute low income housing & apartment complex students among schools to eliminate the 
                          problem that has plagued Timber Lane Elementary. Unless your child tests out of Timber Lane & goes to 
                          Haycock, they are stuck at Timber Lane & suffer the consequences of a horribly run school. 
                         Especially at the elementary school level, there should NOT be schools that have over 1000 students. It was 
                          madness. And it was unfair when other schools had 500 students. I do not believe all Elementary principals 
                          understand AAP or value it.  
                         Exceptions for special needs populations allowing for pupil placement  
                         Exclude Military children already in an existing school/district! 
                         Existing students should be grandfathered in to stay at their current schools, if they desire. No question. 
                          People buy houses based on where they want their kids to attend school - to switch the kids after they've 
                          already begun at the desired school is ridiculous. 
                         Expand existing schools in overcrowded areas, rather than forcing students to go to schools in other 
                          neighborhoods. 
                         Fair Lakes Glen in Fairfax is an island area that needs reviewed and hopefully adjusted. My estimation is 
                          that <10% of our ES (CPES) feed into KJMS & FFX HS. We are a BORDER/BOUNDARY LINE area. With the 
                          traffic is our region, it is lunacy to be designated to schools (MS & HS) that are so far away. 
                         Fairfax Count is already very diverse, so boundary changes to "reflect the diversity in Fairfax County" aren't 
                          necessary. I myself attended FCPS, K - 12 when 80% of the students were white. That is no longer the case; 
                          therefore we do not need to redistrict to reflect the diversity.  
                         FAirfax county has high medium home price. It generates high tax income for the county. As public school 
                          is funded by local tax, it is normal for households to have high expectations on public schools. Changing 
                          school boundary should consider the potential impact on home values.  
                         Fairfax county has very less great high schools.. the level of education that Loudoun county is providing is 
                          lacking in FCPS along with sepcial education schools like chantilly high or TJ.. LCPS provides more technical 
                          schools. 
                         Fairfax County is very diverse. We do NOT need artificial engineering from the school board. Lack of 
                          transparency WILL result in lack of trust. Do NOT ambush people w/ quick changes. People bought property 
                          at places for a reason; school pyramids included. These changes can impact much negatively. 
                         Fairfax County needs more specialized schools to provide broader STEM opportunities and with regard to 
                          boundaries--if you do not LIVE in Fairfax County a student should NOT be able to attend an FCPS school (like 
                          TJ for instance). 
                         Fairfax  county  real  estate  zoned  for  top  schools  is  extremely  difficult  and  expensive  to  acquire.  Any 
                          boundary changes that result in a student having to attend a less desirable school could cause significant 
                          stress on a family emotionally and financially (property value).  
                         Fairfax County school boundaries seem to make little sense. My children commute over 45 minutes to 
                          middle school, and there is another middle school far closer. Our elementary school ends up splitting kids 
                          between two high schools so friends they make in ES aren't with them throughout. 
                         Fairfax County School district is to large and because of this can not meet the needs of all students.  It should 
                          be broken up into smaller districts that can understand and meet the wants and needs of a particular area.

                                                                                         FAIRFAX SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIALS 
                         Fairfax county’s push to develop has in large created this problem. Re-zoning and increased development 
                          have added more families and led to over-enrollment. And Great Falls needs its own high school 
                         Fairfax is a transient area with many people affected by military transfers, job transfers, and an aging 
                          population that's migrating out. Schools are one of the few community anchors children have and they 
                          should have every opportunity to remain within a pyramid as much possible. 
                         Fairfax needs to address and plan for increasing student attendance YEARS before it occurrs. Work with the 
                          BOS and research housing, birth and population trends to stay ahead of rapidly increasing enrollment and 
                          overcrowding. This study should have been done 10 years ago.  
                         Families buy homes and settle at a specific area based on the assumption that their kid completes school 
                          at a specific pyramid. These families should be given sufficient lead time (maybe years) to make adjustments 
                          if their school boundaries were to change. 
                         Families choose specific homes based on base schools which is a huge investment in the community. The 
                          tax base here drives school funding. Students need to stat in assigned schools, and issues addressed by 
                          construction to schools, and ensuring specialized programs at all schools, not boundary change 
                         Families made housing choices based on schools. They should not be forced to move schools 
                         Families move into neighborhoods based on schools. That is how is has always been done. If changes need 
                          to be made it needs to affect anyone new moving in. Current students should have an option. Families 
                          should be able to remain in their current boundaries. 
                         Families move to "desired" schools if they can; require families to check their privilege! But seriously, Ffx 
                          Govt needs to ensure there is adequate space in schools before allowing new construction to avoid 
                          overcrowding.  
                         Families move to neighboorhood because of certain factors, and do not want their children moved to new 
                          schools after they already established themselves at a base school. 
                         Families pay hundreds of thousands of dollars extra to purchase homes within a specific school boundary. 
                          FCPS should reimburse all families for the loss of home value due to any changes in school boundaries.  
                         Families should be allowed to apply to attend the HS closest to them if boundaries have them attending 
                          further away school. HS student who are <re-assigned= because of boundaries should be grandfathered into 
                          their current school. Continuity in HS is critical.  
                         Families should be given the opportunity to enroll in schools of their choice. Boundaries should not be a 
                          limitation. 
                         Families should be given the option because if not this can have a rippled effect into the community  
                         Families should be given the option to keep all their children in the same pyramid even if younger students 
                          would be designated for a new school based in a boundary change.  
                         Families should have option to remain in middle/high school pyramid or follow new boundary.  
                         Families should not bear the brunt of boundary policy decisions. In other words, schools should not use the 
                          expedient method of redrawing lines on a map to address student population concerns. Schools should 
                          focus on increasing infrastructure at current locations to support population growth.  
                         Families spend 100's of thousands, sometimes millions of $ so that their children can attend a specific 
                          school. Worst case is to not give those families who have invested in the neighborhood the option of what 
                          school to attend if changes made.

                                                                                         FAIRFAX SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIALS 
                         Families study school boundaries and are very purposeful about selecting where they will live based on 
                          those boundaries. It is the absolute worst to have those boundaries change. Ideally a group of children 
                          would grow up attending schools with the same community/friend groups for as long as possible 
                         Families that have kids in FCPS school as well as younger kids (not in school yet) should be able to pick to 
                          remain in current high school pyramid. It wouldn't make sense if have different siblings go in different 
                          school pyramids unless by choice. 
                         Families that live less than a quarter mile away from a middle school and high school should be zoned for 
                          that particular school and not schools that are 6-10 miles away. 
                         Families that moved to particular neighborhoods for the school pyramid should not be penalized for schools 
                          that are overcrowded in other places. Property values should be taken into consideration when looking at 
                          boundary changes.  
                         Families that work hard to enable their children to attend a specific school should not be penalized in the 
                          name of politics. There are other ways to better existing schools without altering the current boundaries in 
                          place.  
                         Families who lived through the renovation of a High School should be able to send all of their kids/students 
                          there! WSHS is bursting at the seams b/c of all the families that moved in AFTER completion. 
                         Families with children requiring specialized services should be allowed to choose based on needs of the 
                          child and family (i.e. remain in their current school until a natural transition to the next level). 
                         Families within a boundary that might be subject to change should have the option of requesting to attend 
                          the new school or stay with the old one  
                         Families/homes should not be moved out of a school/boundary without an overwhelming compelling 
                          reason to do so and in all cases, should have the option to remain in the originally assigned schools/pyramid 
                          through high school. Families can request to switch schools if have need/reason. 
                         FCPS also needs to address disparity of funding to schools. The difference between West Springfield HS and 
                          Lewis HS does not reflect fair budget divisions and one can only believe it is due to how boundaries are 
                          drawn and the greater diversity population at Lewis. FCPS must do better.  
                         FCPS Elementary Schools are way too large and need to be walkable. We need to build more Elementary 
                          Schools. Spots should be available for students who wish to continue with a school after a move to complete 
                          the year and assigned by lottery to attend special programs at Secondary for diversity. 
                         FCPS made a huge mistake when they closed Fort Hunt High School which was a neighboring school. Since, 
                          boundaries for schools make zero sense. We now have overcrowding at both Sanburg and WestPo. I do not 
                          want my children to have to change high schools like I had to do or open Ft Hunt back.  
                         FCPS need to look hard at current segregation of schools and how boundaries encourage that. Overcrowded 
                          - or even new - schools that are 100% free lunch are doomed to fail. Diversifying schools via bussing is not 
                          an evil option. It benefits all. This survey skirts the real racism at issue.  
                         FCPS needs moral courage on the Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) front. And need to educate the 
                          community. Public schools are public domain. Our domain is Fairfax County-not one's neighborhood, not 
                          one's side of the highway. We have defacto segregation in our schools. That has to stop. 
                         FCPS needs to do more to ensure ALL students receive an outstanding education, regardless of race or 
                          income.

                         FCPS needs to focus more on the basics of educating our children to think critically about issues rather than 
                          indoctrination. Eliminate the equity office and programs immediately. Using tax dollars for that nonsense 
                          while taking away advanced educational programs violates the public trust in FCPS 
                         FCPS needs to focus more on the basics of educating our children to think critically about issues rather than

                          while taking away advanced educational programs violates the public trust in FCPS  
                         FCPS  needs  to  pay  close  attention  to  enforcing  enrollment  when  boundaries  change.  Half  of  my 
                          neighborhood finds loopholes in order to attend a high school NOT in our boundary, which only further 
                          damages our high school. It's ridiculous. 
                         FCPS never ever listens to the community input. When was the last time you altered course? Once a 
                          'committee' has decided anything, it gets approved. Why bother having public meetings? It creates false 
                          hope that change is possible. Even now, you are wasting taxpayer money by having useless surveys. 
                         FCPS seems to have a cavalier mentality associated with the impact boundry changes will have on students. 
                          The best FCPS schools focus on building a sense of community for their students/families and the continuity 
                          across neighborhoods and for siblings is important.  
                         FCPS should also conduct comparative study on the criteria for boundary review by other school districts 
                          and school systems. 
                         FCPS should avoid over concentration of poverty in any particular school. This leads to lower test scores 
                          and encourages higher performing families to leave. 
                         FCPS should crack down on students who live in other county or neighboring states, but use someone else's 
                          FCPS address to register for school even though they do not live there. Using address of child care providers 
                          to enroll in certain FCPS schools should also be eliminated. 
                         FCPS should create boundary lines that will allow kids to feed into the same MS and HS pyramids. It’s unfair 
                          to students to be zoned to an ES where about 95% of the school will go to one high school pyramid and the 
                          other 5% goes to another. It should all feed to the same HS pyramid.  
                         FCPS should ensure any changes increases diversity. Changes such as the Annandale / Falls Church high 
                          schools border change which basically shifted 500 minority kids to Annandale and 500 affluent and largely 
                          white kids to Falls Church is unacceptable. 
                         FCPS should not change boundaries to address concerns of equity- thereby eliminating well functioning 
                          neighborhood schools in favor of busing. Neighborhood schools have an important role in the life of 
                          children.  
                         FCPS should strive to provide a 10 year boundary roadmap that gives students and parents full transparency 
                          to the probability an area will be affected by a future boundary change and changes should be limited to 6-
                          10 years. 
                         FCPS should take action to either build a parking structure at WPHS or procure that odd little peninsula of 
                          houses in the middle of campus to increase building/parking space. Other schools (not the unwanted 
                          stepchildren of FFC - have parking structures - why not WPHS?) 
                         FCPS students should go to their neighborhood school. There should be a long period of time where families 
                          get the choice to stay in their originally assigned school. Many families buy homes JUST for their high school 
                          pyramid and that should not be taken away from them. 
                         FCPS  system  needs  to  review  the  rise  in  enrollment  among  newly  constructed  condominiums  and 
                          apartment  complexes.  Families  will  move  into  specific  pyramids  regardless  of  type  of  home. 
                          Overdevelopment with no new schools creates most of the overcrowding.

                                                                                         FAIRFAX SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIALS 
                         FCPS's fundamental problem is that the disparity between high achieving schools and low achieving schools 
                          is significant. FCPS needs to prioritize achieving educational goals at ALL schools without pursuing a strategy 
                          that just moves students around to obfuscates their failings. 
                         Fire FCPS superintendent! Fire TJHSST Ann Bonitatibus! 
                         First several questions are TOTALLY irrelevant to ANY boundary issues. And why is this even coming up after 
                          the school board INSISTED for the past several years that boundaries were NOT BEING CHANGED. Instead 
                          of new housing covering EVERY SQUARE INCH OF LAND in the county BUILD NEW SCHOOLS 
                         fix the boundary- policy link 
                         Fix this issue in Fairfax County. Some of the schools are overcrowded while others are under enrolled. 
                          Require students to access Level 4 at their assigned school. Trailers and Modulars are not a long term 
                          solution. 
                         Focusing on improve current school facilities, teachers, program development instead of boundary change, 
                          which only creates more bus/traffic issue and reduce teachers/school staff/admin. loss 
                         For a large district like FCPS (and its lifecycle), regular/systematic boundary changes need to occur--it's a 
                          better use of resources. Students in FCPS don't really follow a feeder system--my son's friends from MS 
                          went to multiple HS. Boundary changes would do little to disrupt current conditions.  
                         For  families  that  choose  to  remain  at  their  old  school,  they  should  be  responsible  for  providing 
                          transportation as buses should remain within their assigned school boundaries. Public school and transport 
                          is a privilege, allowing the option to remain at an old school is a nicety.  
                         For me is more important to protect the students from those students who bring drugs to the school, those 
                          who have bad manners,those who smoke weed inside the bus and around the school, also those kids who 
                          are ganster, you Fcps should control of this cause this is really dangerous  
                         for schools with low student enrollments, what are the reasons for that? Does this have anything to do with 
                          the education quality that is being provided. Also, it is unfair for parents to pay 20% or higher than the 
                          market price just to send kids to the school they trust. 
                         For social /emotional stability it would be best if the student can stay in the same pyramid through high 
                          school. If changes in boundaries occur it should begin with students in first grade, not those already in the 
                          system. Parents can drive their child if necessary if they wish to stay.  
                         For the last question, besides giving current elementary students a choice, new students should start in the 
                          new school and students moving up to middle school should go to the new school. I would keep middle 
                          schoolers moving to high school in their old school. 
                         For the time being, I have no additional thoughts regarding future boundary policy issues.  
                         For those of us that structured our lives around attending certain schools and prioritize our children's 
                          education, any boundary changes that effect where my child attends breaks faith with us and only further 
                          diminishes my support for FCPS management. Under no circumstances should we have to change 
                         Forcibly removing a child from the school because of a boundary change to fit someone else is goals is 
                          problematic and can be traumatic. Families need choices and flexible options. Boundary changes should 
                          not be undertaken lightly  
                         -Redacted-.  People  buy  homes  because  of  school  districts  and  it  impacts  property  taxes.  Changing 
                          boundaries is a regressive policy that effects lower income. Rich will move or go private furthering the 
                          burden and issue. FCPs needs to expand McLeanHS. PLENTY of land and tax rev from Tysons development 
                         Future boundary policy should focus on the well being of the students.

                                                                                         FAIRFAX SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIALS 
                         Future boundary policy should include foreward thinking about housing developments planned or in the 
                          works. Our pyramid has many housing complexes under construction, as well as planned and our high 
                          school is severely overcrowded already. 
                         Generally I think schools should be neighborhood centered and have children who are closer in proximity, 
                          but I also think parents should have the right to take their children (dependent on space, circumstances, 
                          and availability) to any school that fits the needs of that child. 
                         Get rid of split feeder in 22031. Across my St. goes to Oakton, left of my house goes to Woodson and my 
                          house assigned to a high school that is furthest distant FCHS 4.2 mile where I need to drive across the 
                          beltway to get there. But somehow I am not assign to closest HS (1.8) Oakton. 
                         Give enough time for affected families to anticipate the change.  
                         Give families with "new" and "existing" students rising into existing boundary option the option to keep the 
                          "new" student in the old boundary with sibling(s).  
                         Give plenty of notice if school boundaries change so families can decide. Give an option to move or not to 
                          the reassigned school with some conditions (e.g. if choosing to stay at the desired school, may need to 
                          provide own transportation), Ensure the reassigned school has similar program options 
                         Give students a choice to decide whether or not to move to a new school. Friends would not want to be 
                          separated.  
                         Give students in underserved communities the option to go to better schools.  
                         Given the complete lack of expertise and insight parents have when it comes to community needs (vs. 
                          individual needs), I'm not sure how much weight should be given to a survey like this.  
                         Given the imbalance between McLean HS and Langley HS, I am very supportive of new boundaries for these 
                          two schools.  
                         Given the impact of the COVID pandemic, stability should be considered a priority. If a student and their 
                          family feels a change to their environment (i.e., reassigned to another school) will compound any emotional 
                          turmoil, the option to remain in the current school/pyramid should be offered. 
                         Good  
                         Grandfathering is very important. Being in the Langley district was a dispositive factor in favor of us buying 
                          our home. 
                         great survey 
                         Harsh reality - people spend 1M+ on houses in Fairfax County for the schools. While diversity is good the 
                          lowest performing schools are the minority schools in low income areas. If I wanted my kids in low 
                          performing schools we would have bought a 300k house in a low income area. We did not.  
                         Having a neighborhood pubkic school is paramount, many school activities dont occur until the evening 
                          (sports, band) and a late bus doesnt address these, moving students away from their neighborhood schools 
                          will not allow many students to participate 
                         Having diversity in schools is very important, but must be balanced with creating neighborhood schools 
                          where all kids can do after school activities without parents having to drive 45 minutes to pick them up each 
                          day. PLEASE take bad traffic corridors into account when assigning boundaries. 
                         Having friends from elementary school all the way through high school is a gift. Boundaries need to be 
                          examined, but change should not be forced for those already enrolled in a particular school or program. 
                          Neighborhood kids should be kept together when possible.

                         Haycock ES is stuffed with a ethnic and high income student body that does not reflect reality of Fairfax 
                          County's  socioeconomic  profile.  The  student  and  parent  body  fosters  elitism  that  is  appalling.  New 
                          construction at WFC metro provides opportunity for ending enrollment from other areas 
                         Hayfield SS is 10 mins closer than Whitman MS (with traffic.) Why can’t we help and accommodate those 
                          children/families choosing to go to hayfield with some more of transportation - I hear this lame excuse 
                          about gates but every other bus is just fine or accommodate with a bus right outside Belvoir 
                         Herndon Middle & High pyramid seriously needs to be re-vamped. It should pull from some of the Langley 
                          pyramid, given those neighborhoods are soo much closer to Herndon than to Langley.  
                         High school juniors and seniors should not have to move 
                         High School students should not be made to switch schools. So if there is a boundary change they should 
                          be allowed to stay at their current school.  
                         Highest priority to address overcrowding should include building new schools and attaining land to do so 
                          as part of strategic planning and budgeting. Did not answer as no answer is correct. 
                         Home prices reflect buying into school pyramid. If I could be in Langley HS by owning a home in a lower cost 
                          neighborhood I would have done that.  
                         Home values are dramatically impacted by schools. Should those change and negatively impact home 
                          prices, there will be a mass revolt among the parents and families impacted.  
                         Home values are intimately tied to school zones. To adjust a base school will negatively affect homeowners 
                          who may have stretched to afford in a particular neighborhood and would see their home value decline 
                          with a change in base schools.  
                         Homebuyers base their decision on school pyramid reputation. Focus on helping all school leadership excel 
                          & students to thrive in diverse environments, which will protect FCPS home prices everywhere. We chose 
                          Kingstowne for the school quality, diversity, and green space. Wish Lane had Spanish/STEM  
                         Homes are investments. Changing a school pyramid may unfairly impact the investment  
                         hopefully wont affect too many people 
                         House prices vary significantly within the county based on school ratings, and throughput of the school. 
                          Boundaries should keep in mind the sacrifices families had to make to attend a school of their choice. 
                         Households pay a premium on their home purchases based on school boundaries and it would be unfair to 
                          those if the boundaries change.  
                         Housing cost reflects parents desire for good education for their kids, so keeping the current pyramids is 
                          paramount both for value fo homes and certainty of education. 
                         Housing policy is land use policy is education policy. The socio-economic stratification in Frfx Cnty (and the 
                          ed achievement gaps that go along with it) is so incredibly tied to the type of housing (affordable or not) 
                          that I wonder if this policy update is fixing the symptom of a larger problem... 
                         Housing values should be taken into consideration. Housing prices greatly depend on the assigned schools 
                          and change in boundaries will affect the resale value. The price in certain areas can drop in hundreds of 
                          thousands increments. What happens to people who didn’t sell before the changes? 
                         How about something that makes sense? We live around the corner from a middle school and get my child 
                          is bussed elsewhere.

                         How about you work on getting kids caught up from Covid losses in learning! Remediation is much more 
                          needed than re-districting schools. Stop with this equity nonsense & focus on teaching reading, writing & 
                          arithmetic!  
                         How will inserting students from 1 school into another improve the performance of that other school? Why 
                          would anyone put that social burden on children trying to get their own educations? How about trying to 
                          replicate what's been successful in specific schools and using that framework across FCPS. 
                         I am a card carrying Democrat who is deeply worried about racial division & this survey is offensive in its 
                          implications.  Not  one  question  about  academics.  The  leadership  of  FCPS  both  school  board  and 
                          management do not reflect the concerns of families and are wholly disconnected from reality. 
                         I am absolutely against redrawing boundaries. Schools need to be made bigger where the population is 
                          growing. As a property owner that bought for the pyramid and pays taxes, I want to maintain my property 
                          value and the high standards of my schools (which have been going down year over year). 
                         I am completely against boundary changes. This affects the neighborhood, the existing community feeling, 
                          housing values, and forces families and friends apart. Overcrowding should be dealt with increasing the 
                          school spaces, reducing and limiting the number of new homes being built, etc.  
                         I am completely opposed to restructing boundaries based on race and diversity. I believe in neighborhood 
                          schools and the importance of the community it creates. Restructuring boundaries based on race would 
                          create a lot of stress for working parents because of additional travel time to SACC. 
                         I am concerned about the housing market if a school boundary is changed - specifically if the new school is 
                          not rated as highly and house values drop after the boundary change. Something to consider.... 
                         I  am concerned about the value of my home going down because we are on the border of Loudoun. I 
                          welcome new, diverse students into our school Pyramid (Langley) but I do not want my children or future 
                          residents of my home to be moved out of Langley. 
                         I  am concerned that some parents want to create white, affluent schools in Fairfax County, or protest 
                          boundaries that add more socio-economic and/or racial/ethnic diversity to their children's schools. Don't 
                          accommodate their biases. Fairfax County Public Schools values are solid. Thank you! 
                         I  am  generally  against  boundary  changes as they disrupt childrens learning and alter neighborhoods. 
                          Parents move to locations based on the schools there. My preference would be to funnel more resources 
                          to underperforming schools to help them instead of redrawing districts. 
                         I am going to watch this issue closely. We bought our house specifically to be in the WSHS pyramid!! We 
                          are a military family and education is more important to us than an easy commute or a fancy house. We 
                          paid a stupid amount of money to be in this school pyramid. 
                         I am in town of Vienna. Vienna ES should prioritize town of vienna students. Students who are walkable 
                          should not be moved w/o moving bus students first. 
                         I am new to FCPS (though I did attend a middle school here many years ago. I think that students should be 
                          incentivized and encouraged to attend schools further afield to balance enrollment. Perhaps more language 
                          options or AP/IB options could be offered at HS lacking in enrollment.  
                         I am new to the area and I don't have any background on how boundary changes have been made in the 
                          past so some of these questions, like the last one in particular, I find hard to answer. I would need more 
                          historical data.  
                         I am not knowledgeable in matters impacting boundary issues so I cannot say a lot.

                         I am not satisfied that recent trailer construction has resolved crowding issues at Mclean. I am angry that 
                          overcrowding <grandfathers= so many younger students and siblings that the issues won’t be improved or 
                          resolved before my child starts high school. Renovate earlier? 
                         I am not sure boundary is the issue, more high schools need to be built. The area is growing rapidly near 
                          here and shuffling is not the answer. Think ahead to growth and projected growth. Boundaries are only a 
                          temporary band aid.  
                         I am not sure I would elect to send our kids to Fcps if they were starting now. The county is prioritizing 
                          myriad issues that are beyond education. I prefer my kids to attend with neighbors. My kids enjoyed fcps 
                          and seem ready for a big world but the future of fcps seems fraught with social issues.  
                         I am not sure why changing boundaries is necessary. If it’s due to overcrowding, then new additions can be 
                          built.  If  people  are  moving  to  a  specific  school,  it’s  because  of  the  school’s  reputation  and  changing 
                          boundaries will not help in the run long. 
                         I am not sure why we do not have the programs like AAP in every school. I would love for my child to go to 
                          her neighborhood school, but instead, has to travel at least 30 minutes because it isn't offered at her school.  
                         I am personally very happy with my son's school and hope my boundary does not change! 
                         I am strongly against boundary change due to social engineering. It is important for students to stay with 
                          their friends/teachers they are familiar with. Current school boundary was drawn to reduce commute time, 
                          and people are familiar with the schools they are zoned in. 
                         I am strongly against my property's value decreasing not to mention my child attending a high school other 
                          that Langely High School. It is the reason why I moved a long with many others chose to move to Great 
                          Falls.  
                         I am the product of a boundary change and it was very disruptive and caused for a chaotic transition. We 
                          are across the street from the elementary and middle school and within a bike ride of high school. I think a 
                          change with more travel would cause unnecessary fatigue. 
                         I am unclear if the focus here is space issues or equity/student achievement-the problems and solutions are 
                          different. No kids should be spending the few free hours of their day on a bus. The county should stop 
                          building housing without providing more school space. 
                         I appreciate the effort to get input on this very difficult topic. I think the worst case scenario would be 
                          separating a child from her friends when boundaries change. 
                         I attended FCPS schools in the 70s and 80s when the boundaries were continually shifted, siblings being 
                          split up between high schools. Friend groups constantly being split up as well. I don't want to see that 
                          happen to my children or to other families. It was too disruptive. 
                         I  believe boundary changes are necessary to balance out student population, but not to create racial 
                          diversity in schools.  
                         I believe children should be able to attend other schools if there is potential for better performance, and 
                          parents request it, but children should not be forced to bus to a school in order to have higher rates of 
                          different races in the school. There is a bus shortage, always consider ride times. 
                         I believe its important to keep neighborhoods and communities together and not disrupting current school 
                          mapping for current enrolled students. Any boundary changes should be applied prospectively to only new/ 
                          incoming family/students (also giving them the option to choices)

                                                                                         FAIRFAX SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIALS 
                         I believe kids should attend their neighborhood schools, and specialized programs should be offered in all 
                          schools (or at least in all pyramids). Transportation should not be provided for kids who do not attend their 
                          base school. 
                         I  believe  rising  students  should  changes  based  on  boundary  changes  except  when  they  have  family 
                          members already in the existing school.  
                         I  believe school boundaries could potentially be assessed every 5 yrs if there is significant population 
                          growth. However, many families buy homes to be within specific pyramids so changes should be kept to a 
                          minimum, done following the census and only if truly necessary.  
                         I believe that in such rich county, no student should commute more than 30 minutes to his / her school. 
                         I believe the best model is schools that service the neighborhoods. New schools should be built in locations 
                          where there are high populated areas instead of moving kids around to other schools not close to their 
                          homes. (Bussing kids in)  
                         I believe the best way to address overcrowding is to build new schools in highly populated or growing areas, 
                          and that children should be able to attend the school they are already attending and/or that is closest to 
                          their home without hindering AAP/special programs options.  
                         I bought in my neighborhood 20 years ago due to the school boundaries, which changed. I am still unhappy 
                          with that change but cannot afford to move because my house values dropped due to the change. Please 
                          consider new construction, including new schools over upheavals of boundaries. 
                         I bought my home based on the school. I do feel that some school boundaries do not make sense, result in 
                          overcrowding or long bus routes, but I don't want my children to be re-zoned. They've endured too much 
                          change as it is and my priority for them in this pandemic is consistency whenever possible.  
                         I bought my home in order for my children to stay in the same school district. I do not want them moved as 
                          I specifically bought and paid the prices for those school districts. Changing their schools due to a boundary 
                          line is not acceptable after I paid for their current boundary line 
                         I bought my home specifically so my two children could continue to attend the wonderful schools they 
                          attend and I would be extremely upset if boundaries changed in a way that forced them to attend a different 
                          school. Especially because it would also be further away from us. 
                         I bought my home where I did because of the school system my child would attend. The other schools in 
                          immediate surrounding area are relatively terrible, and I would move if my child's schools were switched 
                          to the other schools in my immediate area. 
                         I bought my house 16 years ago because it meant my kids will attend a specific FCPS pyrimad. It will be very 
                          disappointing if it gets changed and my kids would have to switch school. My hope is if you do redistrict 
                          you'll do it in a way where the currently enrolled families can have a choice.  
                         I  bought my house specifically for the assigned schools. Property value is linked to that. This not only 
                          impacts kids but generational wealth. Build more schools. The area is growing! 
                         I can see that people can be very elitist and privileged about boundary changes, but in my opinion ALL FCPS 
                          schools offer an excellent education. I'm more concerned about my children sitting on the bus for ages 
                          every day than moving schools, particularly if diversity improves. Walk the talk, folks. 
                         I can tell by experience that keeping the kids in the enroll high school pyramid is esencial for the mental 
                          well-being!!

                                                                                         FAIRFAX SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIALS 
                         I chose my neighborhood (which I love) based on the school rankings years ago. When it came time to send 
                          my first child to school, the boundaries had changed. They are ridiculous for our elementary school and 
                          should be changed back. The lowest income kids have to travel 7-7.5 miles to get to school. 
                         I decided to move to this area because of good school, I do not want my kids to be moved 
                         I didn't feel informed enough to really answer these questions. This survey raised a lot of questions. I would 
                          absolutely hate if my child had to switch elementary schools because of a boundary change.  
                         I do not believe any currently enrolled students should have to change schools or their pyramid until they 
                          graduate. Many families choose their homes and neighborhoods for specific schools investing significant 
                          time and money to do so. 
                         I do not believe in busing students further from their base school to support diversity in the schools. Long 
                          bus rides negatively impact children on a daily basis.  
                         I do not know if the proposed change affects my family as I do not know the school/neighborhood details 
                          for proposed boundary change. It would be nice if there was transparent information and proposed map to 
                          inform parents before we provide feedback on anything. This survey is generic. 
                         I do not like the boundary change ideas. Our elementary was already closed. We should be able to go to 
                          the schools for our neighborhood, that was the sole reason for purchasing a home where we did.  
                         I  do not support adding triggers to school boundaries based on the characteristics of students or their 
                          families, such as socioeconomics or culture. It is not your duty to generate equal outcomes. Instead, it is 
                          your duty to provide a quality education at all schools. 
                         I do not think it is in the interest of a child to move students from a school they are attending to satisfy a 
                          county goal/objective. I think if schools are underperforming reviews should look at why that is happening 
                          and resources could be shifted in that direction to help all students succeed  
                         I do not want a new school, happy with Vienna Elementary  
                         I do not want my child on the bus for long periods of time. Having classmates close to my daughter increase 
                          the sense of community and make it easier to keep friends. 
                         I do not want the boundaries to change for the Daventry community. We moved here specifically to attend 
                          the West Springfield pyramid. 
                         I  do not want trailers at our schools and feel strongly as population grows, the county needs to either 
                          reassign new housing developments to less populated schools and/or build new schools. 
                         I don’t like to change the school boundary.  
                         I don’t think students should have to move to a new FCPS high school once they are already attending a 
                          current FCPS high school. 
                         I  don’t think that changing boundaries is the right solution. I think that special programs like AAP and 
                          immersion programs should be moved to schools that are under capacity to allow <regular= neighborhood 
                          children to remain in their <home= school.  
                         I  don't believe a student should have 3 or more middle/high schools closer to them than their home 
                          middle/high school. Our home HS is Fairfax but Centreville, Chantilly, and Robinson are all closer to our 
                          house and Woodson is the same distance.  
                         I don't feel I know enough about boundary policy and issues to offer informed opinions. I know how I'd feel 
                          about my own children being reassigned to a new school pyramid, but I also want to be mindful of equity 
                          for all learners. (two responses)

                         I  don't know what's wrong with the existing boundary policy. I do not think it should be changed. Our 
                          children are not lab rats to try out new theories or to impose some ordained-from-on-high diversity 
                          percentages. If neighborhoods are not "diverse" enough, address the issue with the neighborhood 
                         I don't understand the "attendance islands" concept and did not find any answers in a quick Google search. 
                         I don't understand the 37-year renovation cycle that the county uses. Having to project population trends 
                          over that long of a period is too uncertain. Our neighborhood school was renovated about 5 years ago and 
                          is already close to capacity.  
                         I dont want a significant change due to the future boundary policy. If boundary has to be changed, please 
                          keep the high school unchanged or keep the current students in their current high schools. Change may 
                          have bad impact on thosw who are preparing for colleges. 
                         I don't want my children split up due to any boundary changes. FCPS did that constantly when I was a FCPS 
                          student. It was very disruptive to families. The ongoing boundary changes in the 80s and 90s was very 
                          disruptive and upsetting to many. 
                         I experienced a boundary change as an elementary student (4th to 5th grade) and it was far more impactful 
                          that you might imagine. 
                         I experienced a boundary change as an FCPS student. My neighborhood was assigned to Irving & Lee, so I 
                          knew only two kids when I went to high school. The boundary changed my sophomore year, so I stayed, 
                          but my sisters went to WSHS & had a better social experience as they stayed with friends. 
                         I favor school vouchers which allow families to choose any private or public school 
                         I feel like I was some how 'left out' of knowing that I need to prepare my child to be accept in an AP program 
                          at a very early age in this school system to ensure her the best educational future. I also have concerns 
                          about her socially and emotionally going to a middle school separate from friends 
                         I feel that proximity to your home and efficient transportation routes are the most important factor that 
                          should go into boundary changes. I also feel that looking at the entire county overall is important vs looking 
                          at it piecemeal or one overpopulated area at a time. 
                         I grew up being bussed across Baton Rouge, spending lengthy times in transit. I DO NOT want my children 
                          to leave their neighborhood to attend school. Traffic is horrible in fairfax as it is, and bussing kids farther 
                          away is bad for their health and for traffic 
                         I have 3 children. 2 went through AAP and 1 did not. I saw no discernible difference in the 3 kids educations 
                          and I believe the negative mental health issues created by telling 8 year old kids that they are smarter or 
                          dumber than their peers is so harmful. If you’re making cuts, that should be 1st. 
                         I have a friend in Raleigh, NC, who had told me what a mess they have with children from their one street 
                          being bussed to distant, different schools. I thought, <Thank goodness we don’t live there!= Please don’t do 
                          this here, and do not use racial or economic factors in creating boundaries! 
                         I have been on some of the calls when our elementary school was potentially facing a boundary change. 
                          We have friends that the kids have grown up with...some who live down the street. If some go to a new 
                          school and others don't, I think thats hard. We also bought our home based on current schools. 
                         I have concerns about which schools feed AAP base schools. Schools that feed Mosaic AAP eventually feed 
                          to other HS than Oakton. My older son has deep friendships with boys who will go to different high schools 
                          and will be split up at MS. Schools feeding AAP base schools should be in same pyramid.

                                      Boundary Study Supplemental Materials  Final Report 
                  
                                                                                         FAIRFAX SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIALS 
                         I have lived through a merging of two schools, and I do not want my children to have to experience the 
                          same disappointment. In our area, the population will increase and decrease over time since we are 
                          bordered in. The other side of Route 1 can, and will, keep expanding so add needed schools there. 
                         I have zero trust in this survey, this process, and FCPS overall 
                         I  honestly  think  that  there  needs to be another middle school. Great Falls children go to 3 different 
                          elementary schools but there is one middle school for kids in Great Falls, Mclean, and parts of Reston and 
                          Vienna.  
                         I hope immersion and enrichment continues to be an integral part of FFCP; despite being overcrowded, it 
                          brings much needed diversity to our elementary school (which in this case means bringing in native English 
                          speakers). 
                         I hope our child will be able to stay at Lake Braddock. We purposely purchased a house and settled in this 
                          region because my son loves the school and wants to finish high school here.  
                         I hope the county is getting their money's worth from another worthless survey.  
                         I hope what this survey reflects is that diversity and managing the size of schools matters the most, but this 
                          should be tempered by making sure commutes aren't ridiculously long. Also, putting the impetus for 
                          wealthier neighborhoods to have to commute over poorer communities.  
                         I  hope  you  all  understand  that  any  change  to  the  boundaries  will  be  directly  impacting  the  financial 
                          investment families have made to move to a specific school district and will not be welcome by those who 
                          invested tremendously in the housing and their kids’ education. Do not change anything!!!! 
                         I just purchased a house I don't care for in order for my children to go to the schools they are in. Changing 
                          boundaries affects property values of homes and it's very expensive to live in this area. Find other options. 
                          Many parents will be unhappy about changing boundaries.  
                         I know it might off the topic, but if we build more sidewalk(to allow more walkers), it could solve the bus 
                          shortage issue 
                         I live across from my children's Elementary school. It would make zero sense for them not to go there.  
                         I live in Newington Forest. I don't want my kid going to Hayfield or any other high school that is 20 mins 
                          away when South County is only 5 mins away. Proximity takes highest priority. Should any change be made 
                          to this, it will be met with fierce resistance from all resources at my disposal. 
                         I live less than a mile away from Rockey Run MS/Chantilly HS and 1.5 miles from Liberty MS/Centreville High 
                          School yet my kids are bused (25-30 minute bus ride) to Katherine Johnson MS/Fairfax high school. This is 
                          ridiculous. With traffic it's hard for after school activites, friends live far away 
                         I marked the commute to Centreville HS as easy. In normal traffic situations, it is easy. However, we need 
                          to leave @ 7:30 to arrive before traffic starts to back up on Union Mill Road. The gridlock after I have 
                          dropped off my students is crazy. Imagine there are many students arriving late. 
                         I moved to my current house because of the base school system and would not like to see that changed. 
                          (two responses)  
                         I moved to my neighborhood to have my kids go to Carson. My older kids went to Westfield and we have 
                          built a real sense of connection with that community. I would be very upset if my kids were forced to go to 
                          other schools especially if their spots were giving to immersion students.  
                         I moved to Oakton, between Oakton Elementary and Oakton High School, so that my daughter could attend 
                          this pyramid. FCPS has a bad habit of creating boundaries so that children in apartments and condos go to 
                          schools that aren't as good, and are often more violent.

                                                                                         FAIRFAX SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIALS 
                         I paid to live where I live so my child could attend Oakton HS. Boundaries should never change. They can 
                          ultimately affect the over all cost of selling my home (significantly lower). 
                         I pass other schools that are closer to me, that doesn't make sense, so have students go to the school closest 
                          to their neighborhood. If I want my child to go to a specific school, I need to move into that area. Let's not 
                          over complicate it. Thanks for your consideration. 
                         I pay a ridiculous mortgage so my kids can go to their current schools. Do not penalize my family and move 
                          them to another school due to your poor planning on school enrollment. ONLY move boundaries for newly 
                          enrolled students. 
                         I purchased my home and moved specifically to keep my kids at the same schools and would be extremely 
                          upset if boundaries changed in a way that forced them to change schools. 
                         I purchased my home based upon the schools my child will attend. I do not want the boundary modified in 
                          such a way that it negatively impacts my child's education and real estate value.  
                         I purchased my home so that my child could attend McLean high school it is completely unfair that she 
                          would be ripped from that opportunity also I want her siblings to go to that school with her. I made 
                          calculated decisions on where I wanted to live based on the schools, b/c education is my priority 
                         I purposely moved to a neighborhood because of the elementary, middle and high schools. People of Fairfax 
                          county are tired of the boundary changes every few years! Enough is enough. I am old enough to know that 
                          neighborhoods grow and diminish over the years. Just stay the course. Stop changing.  
                         I remember when the SLHS Oakton boundary was changed and people were all in an uproar. I love the fact 
                          that my kids got to go to SLHS (different reasons). I think grandfathering in a family that is already at a 
                          school is respectful and offers the least emotional uproar. 
                         I see closed elementary schools when others are bursting. I wanted my child to attend our neighborhood 
                          school but virtual Spanish immersion which we loved did not translate. Went to the far away AAP school to 
                          get a rigorous education. Would have loved a full time AAP at our home school or closer 
                         i see this turning into a have / have not issue and that is very concerning. Our county is very mixed and that 
                          gives it it's flavour, it's personality. We cannot divide the kids between socio / economic lines.  
                         I should not be punished for having a good job and being white. I chose where I live for the schools and the 
                          boundaries should not be changed to diversify the school! Ridiculous! Kids need consistency!  
                         I specifically bought a home because I wanted my daughter to go to a specific school. I don't want the 
                          boundary to change within our community.  
                         I  spent  a  significant  amount  of  money  on  the  house  I  bought  for  this  specific  school.  Changing  the 
                          boundaries for this school would decrease the market value on my home and put my family in financial 
                          stress  
                         I  strongly  feel  that  all  students  who  are  currently  enrolled  should  be  able  to  continue  in  the  school 
                          pyramid/path that they are currently on and all changes should only affect new students 
                         I support boundaries that map to natural pyramids (avoid split feeders) and minimize travel times - get rid 
                          of  the  gerrymandered  current  boundaries  with  the  attendance  islands.  Balance  capacity  so  capital 
                          investments are made more smartly and less reliance on trailers/etc. 
                         I support boundary review and changes to balance school population and travel time/distance. It does not 
                          make sense to have kids travel 30 minutes to school when there is a closer school that's 10 minutes away. 
                          Kids have to be at the bus stop sometimes 1.5 hours prior to the school start time.

                                      Boundary Study Supplemental Materials  Final Report 
                  
                                                                                         FAIRFAX SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIALS 
                         I support changes to reduce travel time for kids. BUT boundary changes should not affect current high 
                          school students, particularly those in grades 11 and 12 who depend on college recommendation letters and 
                          who are emerging leaders on their sports teams or music/club programs. 
                         I think,as Fairfax County continues to change and evolve, the boundaries need to adjust to ensure the most 
                          efficient class sizes and program offerings as possible. Re-evaluate and make changes but allow students to 
                          stay at their boundary school if they have already started if they choose.  
                         I think any student in HS should be able to complete their primary school career in their current assigned 
                          school. 
                         I think basing the policy on socioeconomic status is the wrong direction to take. Establish high standards at 
                          all schools, replicate successful programs (happening in the best schools) across all schools, and do not 
                          dilute high achieving schools nor lower standards. Keep neighborhood kids together. 
                         I  think boundaries should be inclusive of all socioeconomic statuses as possible. Access to experiences, 
                          tools, and knowledge is huge.  
                         I  think boundary changes are most contentious for people who've moved to and become a part of a 
                          particular neighborhood, school, and pyramid; if you enact changes for new students only and grandfather 
                          in current children, I think that would eliminate much of the resistance. 
                         I think boundary changes should be optional. I know families that move to a neighborhood for a certain 
                          school and you're literally changing their livelihood by changing what school their child goes to. 
                         I think effect on real estate prices has to be a factor. I live in Fort Hunt. The perceived difference between 
                          Mt Vernon and West Potomac is wide and will have a large impact if boundary is moved-which also speaks 
                          to sad state that some schools are much worse than others in the county  
                         I think FCPS is getting too big as a school system. It should split into smaller districts/pyramids that will 
                          manage themselves  
                         I think fcps needs to strive to have all schools equal (much like grade level teams) so that one school does 
                          not become a preferred school. Equal diversity, equal pass rates-hard in some areas I know but as much as 
                          possible-so that every student has an equal opportunity! 
                         I think I world have been more supportive of boundary changes if I knew how it would impact my daughter. 
                          We bought this house so she could go to a higher ranked school. I don't want that boundary to change or 
                          for her to go to a lower ranked school because of boundary changes.  
                         I think if a student is already at a given school they should be able to remain there until they are finished 
                          with the last grade of that school - do not take kids out of their present school even if boundaries change 
                          (ie10th grader stays til done HS) 
                         I think it is important to limit the fragmenting of classes when moving from elem. to m.s and h.s. Try to keep 
                          the pyramids together as much as possible. Limit neighborhoods being left out. By high school, some will 
                          be with less than 5% of their elementary/middle classmates, not by choice. 
                         I think it is very important that if there is a boundary change it does not affect the students that are currently 
                          enrolled  in  a  specific  school.  The  change  should  start  with  the  students  that  start  school  from  the 
                          Kindergarten level to avoid the change of the school environment for current students 
                         I think it is worth considering configuring the boundaries so that there can be neighborhood schools but 
                          that cutting-edge programs and more district resources are allocated to schools that end up being in 
                          neighborhoods with lower property values so that new families are drawn to the pyramid.

                                                                                         FAIRFAX SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIALS 
                         I think it would be great for our pyramid to get more students so support the boundary changes. However 
                          if I had moved to an area where schools are overcrowded but I love my pyramid I might not feel the same. 
                         I think it’s important to involve the community in the process and have a clear and sensible explanation 
                          about the why the change is needed.  
                         I think it’s ridiculous that we live next to Centreville and Chantilly High Schools, yet our daughter will have 
                          to make a 25-30 minute trek to Fairfax High School. I have never understood why we are a part of the FHS 
                          pyramid. You should try your best to keep students together from elem to high schoo 
                         I think it's important to give parents options, especially considering many people moved to a neighborhood 
                          for a specific school and cannot simply buy a home elsewhere when boundaries are redrawn. 
                         I think neighborhoods should be close to the school geographically. 
                         I think once a family is in a elementary/middle/high school pyramid, they should continue in that pyramid 
                          through graduation. 
                         I  think  one  of  the  most  important  part  is  keeping  the  elementary  school  kids  together  throughout 
                          middle/high. I have heard too many stories of kids being depressed in high school from not knowing people. 
                          My kids went to Luther where nobody (except a few from elementary) went to back to Oakton. 
                         I think that minimizing boundary changes is important. I know that this is a complex issue with so many 
                          points to consider and that given more information, I may make different choices on the survey above. 
                          Education of parents is key. Give parents a full picture of the challenges.  
                         I think that school populations ebb and flow and building new facilitate overcrowding should only be done 
                          if  a  school has consistently had overcrowding issues. I do think that if the school is crowded because 
                          students are being bussed in, that should be rethought.  
                         I think the 1 mile rule doesnt work for all schools as far as buses.  
                         I think the current policy is pretty sensible but it says that if a small percentage of students are impacted, 
                          FCPS does not need to do public notification of a boundary change. I think there should always be public 
                          notification. 
                         I think the parents should have a Choice to what school their child goes to. I want my children to all attend 
                          Hayfield middle and high school so they can be back together again soon. Neither one of those schools are 
                          based school but I can people placed them there because I am a FCPS employee 
                         I think there should be a two year notification period so families could adjust/plan. So a 6th grade ES student 
                          shouldn't go to new MS if the boundary change is just announced, 4th grade ES would be first to make the 
                          shift at MS. 
                         I  think this is overdue. The complexity of where your kid can go to elementary school in FCPS is mind 
                          numbing. Immersion this and special that...The Woodson island deep in Robinson school district is an 
                          example of things in FCPS that don't make sense. If you go to Oakview you should go to Robinson.  
                         I think this survey is not detailed enough to properly answer, we don't have enough information to really 
                          know what all the choices really mean. Ex what exactly does making a school reflect diversity of the county 
                          look like, how is that achieved? I don't really know what school islands are, etc  
                         I think your boundary policy efforts are misguided. If you try to force families to schools they don't want, 
                          people are going to opt out of the public school system entirely and send their kids to private school. 
                         I truly hope this is a study which is not a 'veiled disguise' for the type of activities that are currently ongoing 
                          in the Loudoun County Public School System.

                                      Boundary Study Supplemental Materials  Final Report 
                  
                                                                                         FAIRFAX SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIALS 
                         I understand boundary changes are very emotional due to potential impact on home prices. I saw how hard 
                          switching schools for AAP was for my kid; I am more concerned about the impact on the students. If 
                          boundaries change, students should be able to stay in the old pyramid to stay with friends/peers. 
                         I understand the counties need to make a change to boundaries based on population changes. I think the 
                          families who maybe impacted and are currently in the school should be afforded the opportunity to pick if 
                          they’d like to stay at their current school or move. This should only impact new students. 
                         I understand the need to address overcrowding, however people move to neighborhood/buy homes based 
                          on the school. Also, population changes in general from year to year can greatly effect whether crowding is 
                          an issue or not. 
                         I understand the need to change the boundaries but always keep the children in mind. They are more than 
                          likely already comfortable with each other and most of them would not like to change schools and make 
                          new friends.  
                         I understand the need to look at boundaries; however, we purchased our home specifically because of the 
                          neighborhood  school  boundaries  and  all  our  children  can  walk  to  their  schools;  we  would  be  very 
                          disenfranchised to have them sent elsewhere.  
                         I want every child to get the best education at FCPS. I feel that if we make schools all have great educational 
                          opportunities (special programs, AAP etc especially at the elementary level), hopefully every child including 
                          those whose parents have a lower income, will reap the benefits. 
                         I want my child to continue at the base school they are at. We <bought= into our base school. Fairfax Co is 
                          ridiculously $$$ we choose to live in our neighborhood only for the school pyramid we are in. Do not bus 
                          children all over the county in the name of equity. Stop messing with our kids!!!! 
                         I want my children to attend the schools closest to our home. While I believe boundaries should strive for 
                          economic diversity, it should not be done at the expense of increasing bussing and with the density of the 
                          area may not be practical at the elementary level in some areas. 
                         I was in Fairfax County schools as a child 1960-1970. A different school every year until I got to High School. 
                          I missed out on curriculum because it was taught the prior year. I was always a bus rider. I purchased my 
                          house for the schools when i returned to the area. 
                         I was in shock to know that my daughter had to be enrolled in a middle school over 6 miles away from our 
                          house when there are several middle schools within 2-4 miles. Therefore her school bus picks her up an 
                          hour before school starts. 
                         I was the last class at TJ before it became TJHSST. We were kicked out of our school our Sr year w/little 
                          notice and no support. There were 4 suicides the first month of school, our class no longer has reunions, 
                          and many of us are still scarred. "Where did you go to HS?" It's complicated. Be Better. 
                         I would be very concerned if my daughter had to change schools as her current school has an AAP program 
                          that she is enrolled in. We have had a great experience at her current school and do not want her to change 
                          elementary schools in order to satisfy a boundary change.  
                         I would combine Little Run and Olde Creek. Make one a school for K-3 and the other 4-6 plus the special 
                          programs they run. Those schools are too small as they are. 
                         I would hope given the depth of diversity in our county that the diversity of our students is respected and 
                          valued - meaning diverse schools should get the resources/respect they need regardless of boundaries. Our 
                          communities of color/immigrants are currently used as scapegoats of overcrowding 
                         I would hope that the space in low density school could be used for FCPS upper staff or floating staff. Use 
                          the school space for people who dont have an office or even new programs.

                                                                                         FAIRFAX SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIALS 
                         I would like my children to continue to be in school with the same children they have been instead of be 
                          separated. New construction/additions to existing schools makes sense to me. If new housing construction 
                          occurs, maybe a neighborhood school would make sense. 
                         I would like to give enrolled students the choice of remaining at the current school or switching.  
                         I would love to see a boundary change for my high school as 1 street separates the two which will separate 
                          current friends and neighbors. Clarks Crossing should not divide Aubrey Place Ct students from attending 
                          Marshall HS. We prefer Marshall & will move if we need to, to avoid attending Madison HS 
                         I would love to see a more racial balance reflected in each school as well. Every school should reflect the 
                          diversity of the county. Schools should not seem like a <˜black’, <˜Latino,’ or <˜white’ school based on the 
                          make-up. I know it can’t be perfect but I know it certainly can be better! 
                         I  would  love  to  see  all  of  Reston  assigned  to  Reston  schools  instead  of  broken  up  between  South 
                          Lakes/Hughes Middle and Herndon/Herndon. 
                         I would not approve of a boundary change where students are on the bus 30 minutes or more (one way) to 
                          get to their school. I am for neighborhood schools as this helps build up the community and gives students 
                          stability. Maintaining friendships is an integral part of emotional well being. 
                         I would strongly oppose boundry changes in the dranesville area. We moved and purchased our home to 
                          go to schools in the Langley pyramid  
                         I’m from NY and school districts were based on proximity. It’s absurd that kids are bussed from an hour 
                          away here. Seems like a waste of resources and overly complicated when it comes to things like weather 
                          cancellations.  
                         I’m grateful being in the military and being able to live on base. Living on base don’t always have the best 
                          schools in the boundary. To be able to have options when living on a base does make it a lot more 
                          comfortable knowing you have more than one option. 
                         I’m not a big fan of boundary changes, since many families make choices of moving to a particular area 
                          based on the school pyramid and often paying higher prices to purchase a home. Families should have 
                          options to choose a high school if several are in close proximity. 
                         I'd lean closer to every 6 years than 10- 4 seems to often, 10 seems too far apart 
                         I'd recommend opening total school choice, expand successful schools and shutdown schools that will be 
                          abandoned 
                         Ideally, families with at least one child already enrolled in a school would not have to change before a 
                          natural transition point (like to middle or high school).  
                         Ideally, we should all have SCHOOL CHOICE! It would solve ALL problems we face within the public school 
                          system. The teacher's unions are so corrupt... 
                         If a boundary change is necessary, perhaps existing students at a school could be <grandfathered= in to stay 
                          at the school while entering new students will attend the new school. It seems not fair to rip a student away 
                          from his/her friends, school, clubs, and/or sports teams. 
                         If a boundary change occurred and a student currently in FCPS is effected, i.e., his/her next school (middle 
                          school or high school is changed), these students should have choices: either choose to still go to the 
                          "before change" assigned school, or choose to go to "after change" assigned school 
                         If a boundary change occurs and a student already attends a school - allow that child to finish at that school 
                          instead of forcing them to move. Give them the option while making new students go to the school 
                          assigned.

                                                                                         FAIRFAX SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIALS 
                         If a boundary changes while a student is there consideration should be given to staying at that school, 
                          especially if in a specialized program (e.g., immersion). Siblings should also be allowed to attend the school 
                          of their older siblings.  
                         If  a  change occurs, students within 2 years of "graduating" from a school -- i.e. 5th & 6th graders for 
                          elementary, and 11th & 12th graders for high school, should be able to choose to stay with their old/prior 
                          school if desired.  
                         If a child is enrolled in a school and later moves, however remains within FCPS, they should have the option 
                          to remain at their current school or in the alternative, the option to transfer. There should not just be the 
                          option of a automatic transfer. 
                         If a child is not within a boundary of a given school, then their commute/distance should not be shorter 
                          than another child whose boundary is within the boundary of that given school. i.e Child 1 is 5mi and Child 
                          2 is 8mi from School A. School A should not be in the boundary of Child 2 over Child 1 
                         If a family has several children who attend at different grades, that family should be grandfathered in to 
                          the school the eldest sibling attended. 
                         If a new boundary is put in place, all students should attend the newly assigned school unless it will impact 
                          senior year of high school. Then every consideration should be made to keep the senior class together even 
                          if it means trailers or other options for underclass members for a year or two. 
                         If a school has a history of overcrowding and is already a heavily populated school there should be limits on 
                          number of students coming from outside the boundary for specialized programs. Too many coming outside 
                          of area for German at OH over populated  
                         If a school is at max capacity and has immersion or other special programs those should be removed before 
                          families who specifically chose to live in those schools boundary’s are punished by being moved out of the 
                          school pyramid. 
                         If a school is overcrowded, students there may be given the option to request to move to another school 
                          with  capacity;  if  this  does  not  alleviate  overcrowding,  additions  should  be  considered  first.  Assigned 
                          schools/boundaries should not ever be changed without the involvement of impacted residents. 
                         If a student has started attending a particular high school, they should be able to remain in that high school 
                         If  a  student  is  currently  in  high  school,  then  that student  should  continue to go to that high school. 
                          Therefore, a boundary change for a high school would affect students who will attend high school in 2025 
                          to 2026.  
                         If a student moves during the school year (even in the first semester), he should be permitted to finish the 
                          year at the existing school. Also, the existing elementary school should provide the option to let the student 
                          continue until he moves to the middle school. 
                         if all schools had good funding teachers and infra, we would'nt be paying such huge rents, tightening our 
                          belts to be within a specific boundary, so that our kids can study only in the best available school in the 
                          county 
                         If Boundaries are changed then it needs to be grandfathered in. A family will pick a neighborhood or house 
                          based on the pyramid and changing that is highly disruptive. You can give people the option but once a child 
                          has been enrolled they should have the option to stay in the same pyramid.  
                         If  families  choose  to  stay  in  a  school  that’s  not  their  base  school,  they  should  be  responsible  for 
                          transportation.

                                                                                         FAIRFAX SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIALS 
                         If great programs exist throughout every region of the county, I don't think it makes sense to try to "create 
                          diversity" by playing with the boundaries for diversity's sake. Just make all the schools vibrant and healthy 
                          and the rest will follow. 
                         If my child is redistricted out of her neighborhood school where we bought our home specifically for her to 
                          attend those schools, we will remove her from FCPS, send her to private school and promptly sue FCPS, the 
                          Board of Supervisors and the FCPS School Board as a violation of our rights.  
                         If my children's boundary changes and they are forced to go to a new school we would either move out of 
                          FCPS or move to a private school.  
                         If my sons school becomes overcrowded due to boundary changes, i will remove him from FairfaxCounty 
                          school and place him in private school. No goodness comes from overcrowded classrooms  
                         If sibling is attending some high school let the younger one attend same high school  
                         If the boundary for the school is extended, this gives the opportunity for the students to have more facilities 
                          than existing which is needed during covid. 
                         If the change happens in the middle of high school let the student/family decide if they want to move to 
                          the new school or stay at the current one. 
                         If the County grants building permits they should be prepared to build/expand schools to suit. No social 
                          engineering - go to school where you live/bought your home. Any DEI boundary attempts will be met with 
                          mass exodus by those of us who can afford to leave - has happened that way everywhere else. 
                         If the county would stop permitting huge developments within the already over-crowded school districts, 
                          you wouldn't have this problem. The board of supervisors wants more tax revenue but won't build more 
                          schools with it! Why won't they listen to residents who tell them to stop squeezing us? 
                         If the middle school and high school is 30-40 minutes away and there are a high school and middle school 
                          within 10 minutes- that is the school the children should be attending. The closer school to their house. 
                         If the school is in your neighborhood or within 10-15 minutes driving time they should not be moved  
                         If the students and their parents want to move.  
                         If there is a boundary change, it should be implemented at the following new school year. 
                         If there is a way to give parents/students an option on whether to stay or go to the new school. Especially 
                          high schoolers where the class curriculum options make a big difference in future life decisions.  
                         If there is an overcrowded school next to a under-enrolled school then a boundary change should be made 
                          (see West Potomac and Mt. Vernon). There should not be elementary/middle schools outside the high 
                          school boundary (see Whitman Middle School). Save taxpayers money by adjusting the boundary. 
                         If  we made the standard of teaching the same from school to school regardless of average household 
                          income of that neighborhood, it wouldn’t matter the districting. There should be advanced classes at every 
                          school so kids who need them have access without having to switch schools. 
                         If you bus in children from a low income area into a higher income neighborhood, the teachers MUST go 
                          through diversity training. Ask Mr. Morris about that from Stratford Landing Elementary School. Our black 
                          (lower income) children were being mistreated by white teachers. It's a problem. Address it! 
                         If you change boundaries of students actively in a school’s pyramid, FCPS will lose more students to private 
                          institutions. The county made a mistake closing Ft. Hunt High School and the old Walt Whitman Middle 35 
                          years ago and are about to make the same mistake. Adjust the building not the boundary.

                                                                                         FAIRFAX SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIALS 
                         If you change the boundary then it should be a phased approach and should ensure families can keep their 
                          kids at that school and also any other subsequent children at that school so that parents don't have kids in 
                          multiple schools. Also ensure transit resources stay in place.  
                         If you change the school boundaries and make military kids, who already move every 1-4 years, move 
                          schools, you truly have no concern for our children’s mental health. FCPS shouldn’t have access to the DoD 
                          subsidies for military kids that they displace.   
                         If  you let people pick their own schools, you wouldn't have to deal with huge, intractable fights over 
                          boundaries, and people zoned to schools led by principals that are all over the latest stupid education fad 
                          like white on rice can go somewhere else. 
                         If you make all the schools better, you won't have to realign boundaries to provide equity. Kids should go 
                          to school with their neighborhood peers. Parents have the ability to move if they want their child in a more 
                          diversified school. Please stop putting equity above all else.  
                         If  you  make changes you have to give kids the ability to be grandfathered in for the school they are 
                          attending. It is extremely disruptive to move kids.  
                         I'm sure this is a contentious issue for some, but reality is FCPS are some of the best in the nation and the 
                          system gets a lot of things right. Priority should be given to ensuring that this high-level experience reaches 
                          all, especially less advantaged neighborhoods.  
                         In 2016 I bought a house in Great Falls, Va specifically because we wanted our (future) children to go to 
                          Cooper Middle and Langley High School. my now 2 youngest children are now 2 & 4 and we only want them 
                          to attend those schools. It is completely unfair that we could be placed at another school.  
                         In addition to taking into consideration a child being able to stay in the same, boundary change policies 
                          should take into account families (e.g., if current students can stay at the old ES but new students have to 
                          go to the new ES, this may result in siblings at different elementary schools) 
                         In general, boundary changes should be minimized. The focus should instead be on ensuring that the quality 
                          and access to education and opportunities is roughly equal in all schools. Messing with boundaries has 
                          unintended consequences that far exceed the metric one tries to optimize for. 
                         In my opinion you should not base the school boundaries by google maps  
                         In my opinion, the most important factor should be transportation. Students should not be on a bus for 
                          more than 30 min. FCPS has planned poorly-areas with the population growth have NOTHING in the plans 
                          for new schools. Short-sighted planning. Five years out is not enough with the rate of building. 
                         In recent years, Spring Hill Elementary has noticed an increase in families moving to the area to secure a 
                          spot  in  the  Langley  pyramid.  Several  of  these  families  are  moving  into  the  increased  number  of 
                          condos/apartments in the Tysons area and before COVID, causing overcrowding at our school. 
                         In the 1980s, I had to leave the elementary school I'd attended from Kindergarten through fourth grade, 
                          due to redistricting requirements. I had a bad experience, and was on the bus for 40 plus minutes each way 
                          vs. 10 minutes to my neighborhood school. I don't want FCPS students to experience this. 
                         In the 3 decades since I graduated FCPS, I have seen huge demographic shifts in Fairfax County, yet the 
                          most successful schools still have the least economic and (often) racial diversity. This feels like segregation. 
                          We need to fix this. 
                         In the event of boundary shift, extend option to remain at prior high school period through the youngest 
                          sibling assuming that resident address doesn’t change

                                                                                         FAIRFAX SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIALS 
                         In this area people often choose to live somewhere based on the school zone they will be in. This should 
                          not  be  undercut  by  drawing  new  boundaries.  Kids should  not  have  to  switch schools  based  on  new 
                          boundaries. 
                         Inclusion of different programs in versions boundaries would be great. Having too many children of the 
                          same area on a school does not promote diversity which is needed in the schools.  
                         Income should not dictate the school. There should be more balance so that there are not heavily funded 
                          schools and very under resourced schools. This is esp prevalent in McLean and Langley pyramids.  
                         Increase capacity for students to choice into non-neighborhood schools, especially to improve balance, and 
                          increase transportation options to disadvantaged students to increase choice opportunities  
                         Increase the quality of education at the elementary level. Changing boundaries alone is not going to make 
                          students excel. 
                         Infrastructure development must go hand in hand county wide with educational resources. Where are the 
                          demographic studies on all the new developments? What are the builders contributing to the county to 
                          support these new families? 
                         InmersiÃ³n students should have the possibility to use school transportation  
                         Instead of boundary change, focus on expanding facilities, adding teachers and providing a better learning 
                          environment  
                         Instead of changing boundaries, FPSC should make the lower attended schools more appealing by offering 
                          AAP classes, etc.  
                         Instead of spending vital money on our schools, you are wasting valuable tax dollars on crap like this. Get a 
                          grip FCPS!! 
                         Is esencial for the kids mental well-being to keep them in the same high school pyramid  
                         It can be debated that frequent boundary changes are a result of lack of proper future planning and should 
                          therefore be carefully and thoroughly completed to avoid constant changes among the student body. 
                         It concerns me that boundary changes are happening, as I spent the better part of 2 years deciding on our 
                          forever home entirely based on school boundaries. The potential for boundaries to change concerns me. I 
                          know the current change is favorable in McLean, but what town is next? 
                         It disgusts me that FCPS is hiring outside companies to determine boundaries. Perhaps you should focus on 
                          hiring competent teachers and staff and remove the current FCPS Board. 
                         It has been difficult for my older children who when leaving middle school are split up with their peers. 
                          Example Rachel Carson Middle, Also there is not a close high school to where we live in Oak Hill, 20171, kids 
                          are on bus for very long time 
                         It has been very difficult living so far from our base high school. I live in Centreville and we attend Fairfax. 
                          It needs to be taken into consideration the travel time because students involved in activities are driving 
                          back and forth to school multiple times a day.  
                         It is a disgrace that FCPS allows the Waynewood school to continue to exist in its present form.  It's widely 
                          referred to as "Whitewood" and provides an extremely inhospitable environment for families of color.  
                         It is clear that our schools at Kent Gardens, Longfellow and McLean HS will always be overcrowded. New 
                          schools (NOT TRAILERS) are needed. I'm LIVID that Cooper MS is getting a renovation when it is less 
                          crowded. This is seriously not right!

                         It is disgusting how the boundaries for WSHS and Lewis HS are laid out. Families move down the block to 
                          avoid Lewis. Stop isolating the poorer-performing schools. 
                         It is extremely important for the current students, allow them to make the decision to stay in their current 
                          pyramid or not, i.e. DO NOT ASK THEM TO CHANGE IF THEY AND THEIR FAMILIES DO NOT AGREE WITH THE

                         It is hard enough for a parent to get her child to school with every school having different start/end times 
                          so any forced boundary changes for current students may lead to more difficulty with commute, loss of 
                          friends, more financial strain on parents if a babysitter needs to take child to school. 
                         It is important for kids to live near their school so they can enjoy all it has to offer, have shorter bus rides 
                          and form a sense of community.   
                         It is important to balance diversity and high level instruction at all schools. Ideally students will be balanced 
                          in such a way that high and low income students attend all schools.  
                         It is important to bring down the size of the high school and keep it a <neighborhood school <. 
                         It is impossible to find affordable housing in locations where schools are better rated- This is not fair. Also 
                          we should have an option to choose schools if the distance of homes to different schools are similar. 
                         It is not your duty to generate equal outcomes. I do not support adding triggers to school boundaries 
                          especially based on the characteristics of students or their families, such as socioeconomic, race, or culture. 
                          Instead, it is your duty to provide quality education at all schools. 
                         it is particularly important to allow high school students to remain in their current high school if they want 
                          to when boundaries change 
                         It is really important for communities to remain together. For example, the Langley community (Forestville, 
                          Colvin Run, Great Falls, Cooper, Langley) is a very close knit community. The kids all play sports together, 
                          carpool, etc, and they are happier due to this community.  
                         It is too disruptive to not infirm parents at least a year or even two in advance of a boundary change 
                         It is unfair to change lines after a student has started school. Our family paid a premium on housing to 
                          purchase within a specific HS boundary. Changing boundary lines effects the value of homes.  
                         It is unfair to home owners who bought specific houses to change boundaries, especially to young children. 
                         It is very hard on children and families to change schools so boundaries should only be changed if there is 
                          no other solution 
                         It is very important that students be allowed to stay in their pyramid. This is especially true for kids with 
                          anxiety/IEPs. It would be a huge stressor for my child to have to move schools on top of everything else.  
                         It is very important to maintain the AAP programs for kids that need that service. It is beneficial to have a 
                          larger  group  of  these  students  together  that  come  across  boundaries.  Advanced  students  should  be 
                          considered in the same way that special education students are accomodated. 
                         It is wrong to change the boundaries when households have invested large sums of money into property 
                          just to be in their desired school district. We would have purchased a home in an area that is less expensive 
                          if we would have known that we were at risk of school boundary changes.  
                         It makes no sense that I have to drive further from my house to take my son to his <boundary= high school 
                          which offers way less options for classes that my child would be interested in than drive a shorter distance 
                          to the closest high school to my house and have way more options in classes.

                         It makes no sense when a home address is 3 miles away from a high school that was built now recently to 
                          be bussed to a school that is almost 8 miles away just because the elementary school is supposed to feed 
                          into it. My children spent almost 50 minutes on a bus when they could have gone to another 
                         It seems like the desire to create more diverse, equitable schools is driving this survey. Am I correct? I think 
                          that is important, but you are putting the cart before the horse. Raise the instruction and expectations at 
                          ALL schools and the diversity will (slowly) begin to follow. 
                         It seems like there needs to be a mix of all of these solutions applied logically based on need versus only 
                          focusing on boundary changes.  
                         It seems like wealthier residents were given an option to attend the very best school and with the least 
                          diversity. McLean residents have longer commute time to attend the best school pyramids although there 
                          are lower ranked schools are closer to their address. Reassignments continue to favor them.  
                         it seems some schools in FC are less diverse than others and some towns and areas get the most diverse 
                          students. Boundaries should be established based on geographical location to schools.  
                         It should be a roll out process to minimize student disruption. AAP and Immersion should be at EACH school 
                          where demand is requested.  
                         It should be about numbers, capacity, and geography. Not race. 
                         It will never be politically popular to change boundaries, but it is necessary  
                         It would be a disgrace and major mistrust of FCPS and misuse of tax dollars to do anything other than to 
                          keep students at the schools closest  to  their  homes.  Ie.  distance  to  said  school  should  be  a  factor. 
                          Transporting kids to schools further from their homes than ones close by should be the norm. 
                         It would be helpful if FCPS would give two years advance notice of school changes for planning purposes. 
                          Ideally, transition would occur at natural school transitions for current students (K, 3, 7, 9). Plan should 
                          include time for IEP transitions. Not necessarily opposed to trailers. 
                         It’s completely ridiculous there are attendance islands that go to Langley High School from Reston. They 
                          should be forced to go to Reston schools and not ride the bus for over an hour! 
                         It’s emotionally, logistically and financially burdensome to have siblings separated across schools, especially 
                          at the elementary level when one has transferred for specialized programs. Everything possible should be 
                          done to keep families on/in the same bell schedule, transportation and school.  
                         It’s unfair to change boundaries when students are years into their school career and parents planned for 
                          them to attend a certain HS but don’t want to sell their home. My child has been in private school but we 
                          bought this house for the HS my child will attend starting next year.  
                         It's absurd or not clear what you mean in the presentation as reason for a boundary change to offer equity 
                          and quality schools for all? FCPS' goal should be to offer quality schools to all students and families where 
                          they happen to be in Fairfax County!  
                         It's astonishing FCPS even considers changing school boundaries. The majority of homeowners can't pick 
                          up and move when a change happens to be in the schools they thought they'd moved into. 
                         It's  important for students to have as close to equal opportunity and exposure to teachers, staff, and 
                          resources throughout the county. I recognize that this may not always be possible, but where possible the 
                          boundaries and school capacities should facilitate a similar experience. 
                         It's never easy to switch to a new school. But, overcrowding is a MASSIVE problem in FCPS. Also, off-pyramid 
                          special programs are EXTREMELY DETRIMENTAL to kids socially when they return to their base pyramid (eg. 
                          AAP MS off pyramid, return to base pyramid for HS).

                                                                                         FAIRFAX SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIALS 
                         It's upsetting to the resident when the school system threatens to change school boundaries. We chose to 
                          live here due to the school district.  
                         It's wrong for FCPS to change the boundaries AFTER people have paid a premium in housing for better 
                          schools in the district. Work to improve the conditions of the other schools before changing the boundaries 
                          or opening up the boundaries to the schools to non-districted students. 
                         Juniors and seniors should be allowed to attend their current school the year the boundary changes. The 
                          following year those juniors who are seniors should be allowed to attend the reboundaried school. 
                         Juniors and seniors should be given the option to have option to maintain attending current school or 
                          leaving.  
                         Juniors and Seniors should not be forced to change schools. It should be optional as to not disrupt their 
                          final years.  
                         Just in our neighborhood, there are two FCPS facilities that used to be elementary schools but are now used 
                          for various other needs. I am sure that this is true of other areas as well. These could be repurposed back 
                          to classrooms, if needed. 
                         Keep in mind that school boundary changes has a big impact on property values  
                         Keep in mind the impact to home values that moving boundaries will have. Regardless of whether or not a 
                          homeowner has children currently enrolled in FCPS, moving a school boundary can help or hurt their home 
                          value significantly. They should have a voice in the matter too.  
                         Keep kids in the same pyramid from K-12, and ensure they flow logically. We live in the Annandale pyramid 
                          but are zoned for Edison HS, which means that almost none if my kids' middle school friends will be with 
                          them in HS. That seems ridiculous! 
                         Keep neighborhoods together.  
                         Keeping children within their voting district and reducing the commute time. Reduce transportation costs. 
                          Kids already are stressed and reducing their travel time should be a priority. So they get more sleep. Also 
                          some localities are mis-using feeder schools and compromising affordable housing/taxes 
                         Keeping kids in the same school helps them and the family. However, when they are switching anyway, a 
                          change to the boundary should be ok (for example, when going from elem to jr high or jr high to high school) 
                         Keeping neighborhoods together is key for social activities, commuting, and taxes 
                         Keeping students in schools close to home is important to reduce travel time (wasted time at the beginning 
                          and end of what is already a long day).  
                         Keeping the changement as an option to the current families enrolled would be the fairest for those 
                          families. New boudaries should be accepted as said by new families to FCPS. 
                         Key is timing. If somebody buys a house and they are concerned about school attended but it changes every 
                          2 years that is unacceptable. Though boundaries may change, must also allow child chance to attend one 
                          school for duration (meaning minimum 6-7 years based on elementary school). 
                         Kid should have the choice select the school and not paid and biased boundry. My home value is 1 million 
                          and assigned school is not the one we like now. Other highschools are much nearer to our home but cant 
                          go there due to bad boundry allocation 
                         Kids in the neighborhoods should be able to attend the close by schools, not schools that are several miles 
                          away from near by neighborhood kids!

                         Kids should be able to walk to their neighborhood school for class and sports. School os community. If it 
                          changes so does parent involvement/funding 
                         Kids should go to schools in their neighborhoods but should have the choice to go to a better school if their 
                          neighborhood school isn’t performing. Let’s make academics, not politics, the priority in all FCPS schools. 
                          Every child deserves a good education and you are failing our children. 
                         Kids should go to the school closest to their home, unless they choose a further away school for a program 
                          like AAP, an Academy School, etc. 
                         Kids should not be bussed all over the county for school. Don't send my kid on a long bus ride to adhere to 
                          an academic idea of how the county schools should look. Pre-planning on new development needs to occur 
                          so a large group of kids aren't dropped in an already over crowded school.  
                         Kids should spend the least amount of time on a bus as possible. Traffic is terrible in this area. Kids should 
                          attend the closest school to where they live. Families should have a choice when changes are implemented, 
                          so they should be phased in over time. 
                         Kids that start at a school should not be forced to deal with a change unless they want it. Siblings should 
                          stay together for elementary age. All schools should be included in adjustment consideration and not just 
                          those that are in more diverse areas.  
                         Kids West of 395 should go to WSHS. 
                         Kids with IEPs should have the option of attending whichever school they started at. My son started at 
                          school that wasn’t his base. We specially moved to keep him at the desired school when (because he made 
                          progress) would have had to have moved back to his base. Rezoning doesn’t provide stability 
                         Langley has less than 2% of students receiving free/reduced lunches. Mason and Mount Vernon have close 
                          to  65%. Learning is not optimal at 40%. Past boundary changes have created pockets of poverty, eg 
                          Annandale. This must be fixed ASAP.  
                         Langley Pyramid wants to change boundaries that’ll significantly lower property values of homes farther 
                          west  but  in  same  ZIP  code.  We  are  considered  <affordable  housing=  and  provide  diversity  for  LHS. 
                          Eliminating the western region reduces opportunity for diverse families and tax base for schools!  
                         Larger  communities  that  'can  rally  the  troops  and  scream  the  loudest'  shouldn't  be  prioritized  over 
                          smaller/newer communities when being for/against redistricting.  
                         Last change moving our neighborhood from Chantilly to Oakton created a 45 minute plus bus ride with 
                          going w/ traffic on 66. That should never occur with so many nearby school options. Also, younger siblings 
                          weren’t t grandfathered into pre-boundary schools, leaving families spilt btwn HSs. 
                         Learning and education is number 1. Students should attend schools in the communities where they live. 
                          Increase the facilities at schools to accommodate greater student populations where it is needed.  
                         Leave boundaries alone so you don’t financially harm anyone. Build or add buildings as needed instead.  
                         Leave boundaries as-is and build accordingly. 
                         Let high school students stay at their current school for continuity of learning and avoid moving from IB to 
                          AP school.  
                         Let kids be kids so they can go to a school near their house. Busing children across the county in terrible 
                          traffic is horrible idea and will lead to anxiety across families and unnecessary angst. If a particular school 
                          needs something, provide it but don't disrupt to lives of an entire county.

                                                                                         FAIRFAX SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIALS 
                         Let’s not bus students all over the county - schools should be neighborhood based. People deliberately save 
                          up funds and make sacrifices in order to live by a particular school - random boundary change makes all 
                          their efforts worthless. FCPS is already a beautifully diverse environment. 
                         Let's do what's right for STUDENTS and for learning, not what's right for parents, i.e keep property value 
                          high. Let's put our money where our mouth is and fund schools properly. Boundary changes can save 
                          renovation/construction $, which can in turn be spent on children and education (resources)! 
                         Limit transportations given the congestion of Fairfax County. Be cognizant of boundaries such as highway 
                          crossings  that  case  bottlenecks.  Neighborhood  schools  are  important  because  they  foster  the  bond 
                          between administration, parents, students and communities. 
                         Local, wealthy HOAs have too much power to lobby school board so they don't have increase of free and 
                          reduced lunch students in their neighborhood school. Often you see a lopsided FRL population in one school 
                          vs another that is 1/4 a mile away.  
                         Logical locations 
                         Long bus rides = trouble. I have personal experience with double-sessions and loved it, but missed out on 
                          the ability to take more electives. 
                         Low population in any school suggest deficiencies in the school system,environment or specialty program. 
                          Fix it and the numbers will follow. 
                         Main concern should be to maintain current students in their same school until they finish. 
                         majority of people choose home based upon specific schools. make the schools stronger - attract the 
                          brightest and kindest, warm, fun, high achieving learning environment for staff, students, and families, lead 
                          by kind and thoughtful leaders, then all schools will be desired! 
                         Make adjustments regularly so everyone knows it could happen. If FCPS has no authority to tell supervisors 
                          to decline all housing construction, then consider more draconian policies such as bussing all new high-rise 
                          residents to faraway, less populated schools. That would give the developers pause.  
                         Make efforts to raise the ratings of the lower rated schools to provide quality education for all. 
                         Make sure apartments are included in the boundaries for the desirable schools close to them.  
                         Make sure parents actually live in the community and that child goes to the correct school they belong to.  
                         Make sure that we know the possible change far enough in advance that we can prepare the kids. Ensure 
                          that the schools offer the best opportunity to learn while keeping travel time low. Having a process to allow 
                          kids to attend a different school if it better suits their needs and interests. 
                         Make the other schools better in fcps so that the Langley pyramid isn’t the only desirable. Don’t mess up 
                          my property with redistributing students, I know the Fairfax county won’t compensate me for lost property 
                          value. I moved to this specific neighborhood for the Langley pyramid schools. 
                         Making rash changes in school boundaries should be avoided at all costs to lessen impacts on all affected 
                          parties. Ample time to adjust should be guven to all affected families.  
                         Making these changes to keep kids currently enrolled with their classmates that they have been with for 
                          years. 
                         Manage your budget effectively. It is embarassing with the annual budget and FCPS can't figure out how to 
                          perform construction and expand the size of schools that need to be larger.  
                                      Fairfax County Public Schools  December 9, 2021                            P a g e  | 105

                                                                                         FAIRFAX SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIALS 
                         Many families choose where they live because of the schools. Just tonight an elementary school student 
                          told me his family will move so he can go to a better middle school. Make sure policies apply to everyone 
                          equally, not just those who can afford transporting their kids to their preferred school. 
                         Many families in fairfax county purchased their houses to be in specific school pyramids. If there are 
                          boundary changes, they absolutely should not affect children already enrolled, unless they choose to 
                          change. 
                         Many of the higher ranked middle schools and high schools are in areas where rent and mortgages reflect 
                          this, making it harder for people of a lower socioeconomic status to access these schools. There needs to 
                          be more equity across the county.  
                         Many of the questions on this survey have nothing to do with boundaries 
                         Many of these schools specially in south county and falls church, don’t have PTA’s that can afford these 
                          amazing after school programs. One Fairfax is a joke when it comes to being equitable.  
                         Many of us spend a lot on housing to stay within a specific pyramid. If a boundary changes which would 
                          move a child to a different pyramid, the child should not have to leave and go elsewhere as a major 
                          investment has been made to keep them where they are currently.  
                         Many parents and community members will fight boundary changes but this really needs to be addressed. 
                          Please don’t delay this work. I’m not a fan of parents having to send their kids to an AAP center to receive 
                          advanced courses if they qualify. Resources should be available at all schools. Thanks. 
                         Many parents and future parents buy houses based on the school zone, and changing the school zone will 
                          affect the housing prices unfairly. I hope there is a restriction on those who can make this decision as to 
                          their land/house purchase/sale in fairfax county.  
                         Many parents buy their home based on the school they want their kids to attend, so the parents/kids should 
                          be grandfathered in the original feeder schools but be given an option to go to the newly assigned school if 
                          they are ok with it. 
                         Many parents have bought homes specifically for their children to attend certain schools and would be 
                          devastated to have them go to a lesser school because of zoning. 
                         Many parents put a lot of thought into where they buy homes based on local schools. Boundary changes 
                          undermine their efforts and potentially upend a whole family's plan/life; there is no benefit. Students and 
                          parents will suffer with upheaval. At the very least, it is a source of extreme stress.  
                         Many parents put a lot of thought into where they buy homes based on local schools. Boundary changes 
                          undermine their efforts and potentially upend a whole family's plan/life; there's no benefit for the student. 
                          Rather focus on expanding buildings on existing sites and offering specialized programs. 
                         Many parents such as myself have made an active choice to live in a certain area so their child can attend a 
                          specific school. I chose my current home so my son can attend his Middle and High school. The county 
                          needs to take these situations into account when updating school boundaries. 
                         Many people bought property because of the schools. This is a big deal. 
                         Many people buy homes because of the schools. This should be considered. It should also be considered 
                          that students shouldn’t have to leave friends they’ve been with for years.  
                         Many people intentionally move to certain areas specifically for the schools. If you change the boundary, 
                          do people then have to sell their homes and move to somewhere inside the new boundary, if they can even 
                          find something available? Changing boundaries is hugely disruptive.  
                                      Fairfax County Public Schools  December 9, 2021                            P a g e  | 106

                                                                                         FAIRFAX SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIALS 
                         Many people purchase homes due to the specific assigned school so changing boundaries that affect the 
                          schools will have a negative impact to the family life.  
                         Many people purchase their home with the intention of their children going to a specific school pyramid, it 
                          would be unfair to change the school boundaries for those who already have a child in school. If children 
                          are already enrolled in FPCS they should be allowed to remain where they are. 
                         Many people purchase their homes based on the school. Do not force a change, or give the student the 
                          choice to finish at their originally zoned school while still providing transportation.  
                         Many residents purchase a home largely based on the school pyramid. I understand the desire is to have 
                          ALL school pyramids be excellent, but changing boundaries can have many more trickle down effects. Please 
                          keep boundaries rational and do not put neighbors of the school in a different zone. 
                         Marshall was renovated to be Tysons High School, but now it’s overcrowded? So time to move IB since xfers 
                          were closed- how about to Falls Church since their students were leaving to go to Marshall? or build another 
                          school traffic in tysons will prevent school buses from moving too far eventually.  
                         Maybe reassign highly regarded teachers to border schools when redrawing to help win over support 
                         Maybe we should look at rehab schools in shorter cycles than current 30 year.  
                         McLean High School is very overcrowded. It is also the only high school that seems the most run-down. We 
                          pay the highest taxes in the county and the school does not reflect all the funds we pay. It is a bit 
                          disappointing. The athletic fields are also subpar. I'm a former college athlete.  
                         McLean High School needs its population reduced NOW. 
                         McLean HS (and LMS, and KGES) are drastically overcrowded which entails huge classroom numbers not 
                          conducive to a good learning environment. With the huge amount of taxes we pay here, I would expect 
                          smaller classes and redistribution (i.e. to Langley) of students.Trailers are a disgrace. 
                         McLean HS is overcrowded but Langley HS next door is renovated and under crowded. If there were invites 
                          to go from overcrowded schools to under crowded ones like this, I am sure many would take that.  
                         McLean HS is ridiculously overcrowded. All new students residing north of Rt. 123 should attend Langley 
                          (which is under capacity and newly renovated), especially those in the exploding number of Tysons high rise 
                          buildings. McLean HS should also be renovated to eliminate portables. No "Decoy Houses." 
                         McLean overcrowding should be highest priority and immediately adjusted to balance enrollment at lower 
                          enrolled Langley which new boundary is in effect. Give students a choice to stay or attend new school. 
                          School events, activities, transportation difficult to manage for families. 
                         Mi opiniÃ³n Es que..se haga lo que se pueda como pedir colaboraciÃ³n con los padres de cada alumno. 
                         Middle and High schools should be less than 10 mins drive for kids irrespective of boundaries.  
                         Middle school and elementary students will follow the new high school or middle school.  
                         Middle schools should flow into mostly one high school. Our current MS only has 10% that feed into South 
                          Lakes. The rest comes from Langston Hughes. This is very hard to loose friends from the past 9 years and 
                          try to fit in groups already formed in high school. Keep kids together through HS. 
                         Military families move to neighborhoods based on schools. Changing a child's school during the time they 
                          live here causes even more disruption to their lives. They should be able to finish at the school they start at 
                          if wanted. 
                         Minimize disruptions and blend realignment with school construction  
                                      Fairfax County Public Schools  December 9, 2021                            P a g e  | 107

                                                                                         FAIRFAX SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIALS 
                         Minimize the impact on existing students by not forcing kids to transfer to new schools between school 
                          years are important  
                         Minimizing travel time for children and permanent construction at schools should be the priority. We pay 
                          high taxes to live in this County and have high expectations from FCPS 
                         Minimum negative impacts on the current students to minimize stress; all new students should follow new 
                          boundaries. 
                         More focus on building student agility vs constant accommodation of what they are used to.  
                         More instruction and less social engineering. Please!!!!!!!!!!!!!! 
                         More parking would alleviate some transportation needs. As many juniors have their drivers license, are 
                          willing to carpool, and have vehicles But not enough parking spaces at the school to be a viable option. I 
                          daughter takes an AP class online which requires her to leave school grounds early, 
                         More schools are needed where population growth occurs due to new constructions. Fcps should anticipate 
                          the new influx and work parallel with the town committee who oversea new construction to avoid the 
                          possibility of cramming the existing schools with new students.  
                         Mosaic is our assigned AAP Center school and provides a much more developed academic challenge from 
                          our base school. This leads to a very high proportion of base school AAP kids choosing Mosaic. However, 
                          Mosaic is out of our pyramid, which disconnects those kids from long term peers, etc. 
                         Most families purchase a home based upon the specific school district for their children. It will create an 
                          uproar to change these boundaries.  
                         Most importantly, allow families a choice if the boundaries must change. 
                         Most of the parents in this area purchased their homes so that their child could attend the assigned schools. 
                          This is a huge investment, so changing the boundaries should be undertaken thoughtfully and allowing 
                          students to graduate from the school they are currently enrolled in is important. 
                         Most of these questions should have no impact of boundary line decisions 
                         Most people pick their neighborhood based on the culture of the school, pyramid and neighborhood. 
                          Moving boundaries to diversify for demographics, income and other balancing is unreasonable and unfair 
                          to why a house was purchased in the first place. Redevelop is key instead of rebounded changes. 
                         Move some mclean kids to langley. Langley needs some multi family housing feeding to it, and the si for 
                          family housing neighborhoods that are 30 minutes away should go to Herndon so that all the Tysons multi 
                          family growth can go to Langley. 
                         Moving children around should NOT be the solution. We should estimate and plan for growth and prepare 
                          our schools with creative, innovative solutions. Brick n mortar changes are limited by physical/financial 
                          capacity.   There're other creative ways to do this. Let's find them and use them. 
                         Moving school boundaries is extremely disruptive to families who have multiple children spanning a wide 
                          variety of ages. Allowing families the choice of moving to the new school while enforcing new boundaries 
                          when entering into middle/high school will allow students stability. 
                         Moving students from a school that has a lower academic profile to one with a higher academic profile does 
                          no harm; moving students from a high performing school to a struggling one is unfair and impacts housing 
                          value and college options.

                                                                                         FAIRFAX SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIALS 
                         Moving the boundaries to create equity is the wrong answer. Instead fix the root issue, which is some 
                          schools and students don't have access to the resources they need and that's the reason for poorer 
                          performance. Creating a new mix of students to "equalize" scores only masks the problem at hand.  
                         Moving the boundary of schools should be a last resort.  
                         My biggest concern currently are my kids go to school with same kids in elementary then changes for middle 
                          and changes again for high school. 
                         My child attends a school community that offers excellent resources, which is a reason I live where I do. If 
                          arbitrary boundary decisions then dictate she must move to another school, that is further away and with 
                          fewer resources, this will be highly unsatisfactory and unacceptable. 
                         My child has already moved schools within FCPS and yet another move would be traumatic to say the least. 
                          Please do not change the boundaries without the option to stay in the current school pyramid.  
                         My child is in the Level 4 AAP program at a school not in our HS pyramid (though there are other AAP schools 
                          in our pyramid that are closer to us!). She will spend 6 yrs with her friends and then have to go to her base 
                          HS, which means starting over with friends. Keep AAP kids in their HS pyramid! 
                         My child went to a split feeder elementary (GBE) and an AAP program at the school (GBW) that didn’t feed 
                          to her assigned MS. I think she would have benefited from going to MS with her peer group.  
                         My children are in one of the more over crowded schools (West Potomac). That being said, both have strong 
                          feelings about remaining in the school because of the relationships with the teachers and counselors. Those 
                          considerations should be considered prior to redistricting, where possible.  
                         My children spent over an hour to get home from school each day due to the boundary set up. They were 
                          not allowed to use a pen or pencil (weapon?) on the bus to do homework, so my elementary-aged children 
                          were complete drained when they finally got home after 5pm. Homework/mental health suffered. 
                         My D was told at elem. school (Floris) that all kids go to Westfield HS which is untrue of a very small group 
                          (us) and then her middle school that she attends for 2 years will be broke up into Oakton, South Lakes, 
                          Westfield, TJ and I hear another? They are constantly starting over with new kids.  
                         My daughter attended Spring hill elementary, and now she is in 8th grade in Longfellow and moving to 
                          Mclean High next year. Although Langley High school is the same distance from our place and much less 
                          populated. The School boundaries for Middle school and High school does not make sense.  
                         My daughter currently in GBW as AAP that was walking distance, in a coming two years, based on current 
                          boundary, she has to go to Katherine Johnson Middle School, which is way too far, She shall be able to 
                          attend rocky run middle school that is so close, the same as Chantilly high school.   
                         My daughter is in a carpool. Leaving school can take 40 minutes to get home, but is still quicker than the 
                          bus. 30 minutes is just getting off school property. 
                         My daughter study at Robinson, but her school boundary school is Lake Braddock. She has to walk or ask 
                          for ride, because It's not allow transportation. I think it's not fair. As a single mom is very difficult to pick up 
                          her. 
                         My daughter went to an elementary school (Floris) where she was told she would go to Westfield HS. And 
                          in middle school, she will make new friends who will be separated amongst many HS incl. Westfield, Oakton, 
                          South Lakes, & TJ which is ridiculous! My HS kids lost track but tried to keep in touch! 
                         My daughter’s ONE HOUR bus ride to and from her boundary-assigned school is totally unacceptable.

                                                                                         FAIRFAX SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIALS 
                         My daughter's friends in our small walkable neighborhood attend 4 different elementary schools. It's 
                          absurd. I vote at graham rd, but she attends timber lane. Students on the same street go to Pine Spring. 
                          Also all of Timber Lane should go to Longfellow. Splitting the students up is terrible.  
                         My husband and I have spent a lot of money on our home. We purchased to stay in WESES, Irving, and 
                          WSHS. Our plan has always been to buy in West Springfield and stay until the kids graduate. Please do not 
                          change our boundary. We pay a lot in taxes to live here - find another solution, PLEASE!!! 
                         My kid is in elementary school that’s 5 minutes away. But our middle school is 45 minutes away. Middle 
                          school bus comes at 6:15 am!! Our high school is even further. This shouldn’t be happening. We need to 
                          change boundaries where kids aren’t on buses over 30 minutes.  
                         My kid is in elementary, but when she ages out she won't go to the same school as the majority of her 
                          school because we're zoned to go to a school much further away instead of the ones local to us. Fix it please.  
                         My kid is part of an <island= population and I am not crazy about this; we’ll probably move because of it. 
                          There aren’t enough boys he can connect with in his class and the <islanders= end up sticking together not 
                          integrating with the rest of the class. He gets different content and is still bored.  
                         My kids are assigned to a high school that will be a 30+ min commute, and could attend 3 other highschools 
                          that are closer. We will move or enroll in private school if he is not redistricted or allowed to people place. 
                         My kids are assigned to Kilmer MS, however, we live directly across the street from Mary Ellen Henderson. 
                          It would be more prudent to have my children attend a school based on this proximity, and be given a 
                          choice if they would want to attend that school (even though it's out of boundaries) 
                         My kids are doing well in a school that has high ranking. I do not want my kids moved to a school with 
                          medium ranking  
                         My kids go to Rachel Carson to South Lakes. Only 10% of MS goes too South Lakes. Loosing 90% of your 
                          friend base going to High School is really hard. Over 70% of the Middle school should feed to one high 
                          school.  
                         My kids middle & high schools are completely different than what our area roads lead to. Both the middle 
                          & high school are on the same big lane here in Chantilly, but the base schools are some where else. It would 
                          be nice if boundary change considers such straightforward road connectivity. 
                         My kids went to Oak View - which we are an "island neighborhood" that then goes to Frost/Woodson. Oak 
                          View is overcrowded and Olde Creek is smaller and fleets up into Frost/Woodson. Town houses on Sideburn 
                          Road that go to Old Creek Elementary, but then switch to Robinson (Oak View's MS).  
                         My neighborhood splits into 3 elementary schools, 2 middle schools and 3 high schools. Hard for the kids in 
                          high school when they are in the minority. High school is diverse because of location. Proximity makes it 
                          easy to maintain friendships outside classroom 
                         my one concern is removing a child from their school and putting them into a new school- away from 
                          friends,  teachers.  I  went  to  two  different  elementary  schools  and  three  different  high  schools.  that 
                          transition is difficult and I wouldn't want our children to have to go through that if avoidable.  
                         My other child goes to Fairfax HS, it takes 45 min to 1 H for her to arrive home, while Chantilly HS is 5 min 
                          from our house by car, true we live in Fairfax zip code area but FHS is far from our house. While my HS kid 
                          attend Fairfax HS, my ES kid attend Centreville school!, that need to be changed  
                         My personal concern is we bought our house specifically for the Woodson pyramid, and a change to that 
                          would impact all members of our household negatively.

                                                                                         FAIRFAX SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIALS 
                         My preference is that the school boundaries allow children to attend the closest school possible. They more 
                          children could walk to school, instead of taking a long bus ride to a school further away. 
                         My primary  concerns  are:  (1)  Minimizing  student  disruption-My  children  have  developed  long  term 
                          friendships with their classmates, (2) Property Values are linked to the quality of the public schools and 
                          school boundary changes would have a direct impact on property values.  
                         My primary concerns with altering boundary lines relates to student and teacher inequality- consistent with 
                          gerrymandering and redlining.  
                         My school board representative ran onto no changes to boundaries. I pay a lot in property taxes for my 
                          school district. Stop messing with our schools and hiring an expensive consultant, taking away from the 
                          kid’s education  
                         My son currently drives a carpool to school. It is normally an 8 minute drive. It is not uncommon for him to 
                          take 40 minutes to drive home because of congestion getting out of the school property. 
                         My son had a choice of AAP in base school or AAP Center. If he had done AAP in base school he would have 
                          been with the same 20 kids in a class for 4 years. At the Center he has had a variety of classmates, which 
                          has been very helpful as he has a harder time making good friends. 
                         My son is in 6th grade. We moved to this neighborhood specifically to go to this HS. It is important you 
                          allow students who are currently enrolled in school K-11 to remain in their HS pyramid.  
                         My son received an exception to stay at Waynewood for medical, social, emotional reasons and it is 
                          important to keep that provision.  
                         My son's school Kent Gardens Elementary is too crowded. He attends class in a trailer. School boundary 
                          should be redrawn to reduce enrollment ASAP 
                         My student rides the bus for an hour to attend our assigned elementary school. There is another Elementary 
                          school less than 1 mile from my home which is not my child’s assigned school. It doesn’t make sense.  
                         My suggestion is to ensure that any outside parties involved have no conflicts of interest that will result in 
                          boundaries that create or exacerbate inequities.  
                         My suspicion is that this is not about solving a problem of over crowded or under-used schools. I am afraid 
                          this is just another way to push "Equity and Inclusion".  Though I do think we must be mindful of extensive 
                          busing as gas prices continue to rise and global warming becomes an issue.   
                         My two boys go to a school on the edge of Alexandria (Key/Lewis). The school that 90+% of their 6th grade 
                          class attend (Irving/West Springfield) is about 2.5 miles away from our house. My kids have a 45-minute 
                          ride in the morning. Middle school picks up at 6:40. It's ridiculous. 
                         Natural boundaries, i.e. rivers, lakes, interstate highways, parks should be entered into the equation. 
                         Need to also revisit all current boundaries within pyramids and across pyramids and regions.  
                         Need to create new schools in high population growth areas. When you change the boundaries it makes it 
                          better in one school bit a few years later the school with added growth needs rezoning. It is just putting a 
                          bandaid on the problem instead of fixing it for long term. 
                         Need to understand more why this is even being proposed. Are there problems with overcrowded schools? 
                          Do some schools have too little enrollment? That has not been made clear. Keep neighborhoods together. 
                          Do not make kids change and force them to be bussed elsewhere for the sake of diversity 
                         Neighborhood schools are extremely important, especially for full participation in extracurricular activities. 
                          Level IV AAP services should be offered at each school and stop bussing kids. 
                                      Fairfax County Public Schools  December 9, 2021                            P a g e  | 111 
                                      Boundary Study Supplemental Materials  Final Report 
                  
                                                                                         FAIRFAX SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIALS 
                         Neighborhood schools are great, but every neighborhood school should have the same opportunities for 
                          learning so that one neighborhood school doesn’t have a better curriculum than another.  
                         Neighborhood schools are important. They provide a season of community; families walk to and from 
                          school together, families interact with other families during drop off and pick up, school friends live close 
                          by. Busing and traffic circle drop offs cannot foster those benefits. 
                         neighborhood schools are important. do not break up communities. keeps friends and families together to 
                          play when school is out.  
                         Neighborhood schools are why we LOVE our school (Vienna Elementary) and public schools in general. 
                          Going to school with friends that live nearby and close to the school creates a sense of community that 
                          cannot be replicated when kids are bussed all over the place for special programs. 
                         Neighborhood schools tend to have fewer resources than larger/center schools. It translates into fewer 
                          field trips, assemblies, and activities. Therefore, the student experience is different compared to the one 
                          attending a larger school with more resources including PTA resources.  
                         Neighborhood/community schools are often the primary factor in buying a home in a school district. At 
                          least 2-years advance notice of the boundary change should be provided to give families enough time to 
                          move in/move out of the boundary. 
                         Neighborhoods change over time and it only makes sense to try to distribute students across the available 
                          schools. This should not be an excuse for forced diversity. Shame on you for using children to further your 
                          political agenda. Prioritize neighborhood-based schools. 
                         Neighborhoods should not  be  broken  up  at  different  schools  -  kids  should  be  with  their  friends  all 
                          throughout school years  
                         Neighborhoods that had a boundary change in the last 10 years should not change again so soon. Younger 
                          siblings should be allowed to remain in the same pyramid as their older siblings for sure! Very important 
                          school communities in families. 
                         Neighborhoods that have boundaries change in the last 10 years should not have to change so soon. People 
                          buy houses after recent changes and don't expect another change. It is also very important to allow families 
                          to continue to let younger siblings attend the same pyramid that older siblings did. 
                         Never change schools on a family. Not ever. For any reason.  
                         New construction in areas has added to overcrowded roads to get to schools and should be taken into 
                          account 
                         New construction should be considered before changing boundaries. 
                         New construction, renovation or additions to existing facilities should be the priority. Busing is not a solution 
                          in a high traffic area like Fairfax County. Changing boundaries maybe cost effective in the short term but its 
                          not a long-term solution.  
                         New schools must be built to accommodate the growing population, specialized sub-schools in all regions 
                          and the changes should focus on rising middle and high school; it should be a choice for current sophomores 
                          thru seniors. 
                         New schools should be constructed to solve overcrowding. The residents should have the option to choose 
                          attending the existing school or new school. 
                         New to FCPS1.disparities in schools how impacted by boundary changes 2. high cost of living in school 
                          district. 3.Trailers are not optimal. 4. allow clusters of kids to change schools. 4. should not allow special

                                                                                         FAIRFAX SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIALS 
                         New to the US, so maybe a different view. Our neighborhood made sense to the boundary of ES, but not to 
                          the high school boundary. Maybe an overlap of ES with high schools is an option. 
                         Next year, my daughter will be required to travel thru Tysons Corner from Vienna to attend GCMHS versus 
                          the much closer JMHS. She rides the bus for 45 minutes each way now to Kilmer;this is unacceptable. I 
                          moved to the area to reduce my commute unaware that my daughter's would commute increase. 
                         No boundary changes please 
                         No boundary changes until attendance numbers normalize post-pandemic.  
                         No boundary should run through a single neighborhood. In other words, kids in same neighborhood or HOA 
                          should attend same school.  
                         NO Change. I bought my house fot a VERY SPECIFIC HS pyramid! NOT moving my kids in 8th & 11th 
                          grade!!!!!! I paid an extreme amout for where we are b/c of schools we are zoned for. 
                         No changes 
                         No changes to the boundaries should be made until school attendance evens out post-pandemic.  
                         No child currently enrolled in a FCPS school should be forced to change schools.  
                         No child should be on a bus more than 1/2 hour one way. If schools aren't diverse (& our's is), that's an 
                          affordable housing issue. Busing kids cross-county creates more issues b/c it decreases ability for kids to 
                          interact after school, in activities, etc. b/c buses won't help then. 
                         No current students should have to change schools unless their families want to. Minimize redistricting and 
                          redrawing boundaries.  
                         No gerrymandering  
                         No more overcrowding! Need to change boundaries ASAP! 
                         No one buys a home thinking that their student won’t go to their neighborhood school. And families should 
                          define what constitutes a neighborhood.  
                         No one likes boundary changes but I think over crowded schools are worse.  
                         No one wants their child to be bussed so FCPS can meet their <equity goals.= It has been tried before, and 
                          it was an utter failure. A good solution would be to permit students from certain schools to CHOOSE to 
                          enroll in another school if there is space. Like a lottery of sorts...  
                         No one wants to have boundaries switched, but schools in our pyramid are getting too overcrowded, and 
                          this has been increasing over the past 5 years. Something does need to be done. 
                         no rising senior should be reassigned in their last year.  
                         Not all changes benefit kids. Quit making so many changes every year and volunteer in a classroom or two. 
                          Use resources to add staff so class sizes can be smaller and kids can actually be taught. Add trailers if needed 
                          to accommodate. 
                         Not included in these questions is the impact on home values. This should be addressed as a boundary 
                          change can increase or decrease home value. The ultimate solution is not to have schools that decrease 
                          value. 
                         Oakton HS seems to be fully populated at this point. This survey must be referencing other schools that lack 
                          population!

                         Offer a tuition cost charge for parents that are forced to move to a school that they were not originally 
                          planned for. For example, my daughter is assigned to Mosby Woods Elementary. If required in the future 
                          to attend another school, I should be able to pay tuition for her to remain at Mosby. The  
                         Often, people moving to the area base their decision on where to relocate on the schools that serve the 
                          particular neighborhood. Changing boundaries impacts not only the students but also the property value. 
                          This needs to be considered during the evaluation process. 
                         Ok to balance between McLean and Langley high school. But leave great falls and Vienna alone 
                         On  a  proactive  front,  does  FCPS  coordinate  with  organizations  such  as  the  Fairfax  Cty  Economic 
                          Development  Authority  which  anticipates  growth  that  could  be  useful  in  planning  ahead  for  school 
                          populations as well? 
                         Once a student has started either a Middle School or High School, they should remain at that same school 
                          through completion. 
                         Once I child enters middle school, and is part of the high school feeder, they shouldn’t be forced to change 
                          if boundaries change. It will be too disruptive to the student and family since the middle schoolers are 
                          already expecting to move to a certain high school.  
                         Once in the system and living at the same home, students shouldn't have to change schools. Also, no need 
                          to remove trailers for what appears to be a near-term shortage of students. Boundary changes shouldn't 
                          be done too often, but aren't a huge deal...other than managing the grandfathered in kids. 
                         Once kids get to middle school, they're all mixed up and lose their elem sch identity. I would not break up 
                          kids while they're in elem school. I believe in neighborhood schools. I selected "remain in the HS pyramid" 
                          bc I prefer our hs's programs (Edison) to the other potential hs (Hayfield) 
                         Once. Child reaches high school they should not be moved they should be allowed to stay with their friends 
                          and graduate from their current HS 
                         One boundary change can make a massive difference. We are so close to Centreville High however we are 
                          zoned for Fairfax High. Boundaries must be redone.  
                         One of the main reasons we purchased our home is due to the inbound McLean HS pyramid and homes are 
                          priced based on this assumption. If boundaries are changed that affect the high school, it will not only affect 
                          the schooling my child receives but also change the value of our neighborhood.  
                         One of the options for overcrowding solutions should have been the hiring of more teachers and admin 
                          staff so to elevate the budgetary focus on developing and using the incredibly untapped talent available.  
                         One reason the school is overcrowded is because students out of boundary are allowed in. Reduce the 
                          students to those that are in the boundary of each school.  
                         Open another STEM school or Arts magnet HS somewhere in Tysons. If there is that much demand, why not 
                          2 schools? It would alleviate some enrollment issues. More IB/AP for more kids at base schools. Increasing 
                          the rigor and opportunity decreases the need for boundaries for a "better" learning env. 
                         Our base high school is too large. The support our daughter got was negligent, ill informed, and at points 
                          malicious. We do not want the same for our son. However, a boundary change would not impact us. If FCPS 
                          truly wants to live up to the reputation they publish about themselves, this is not it. 
                         Our children have experienced so much upheaval, change, and uncertainty due to covid-19. Please do not 
                          make them change schools right now. It is too much to ask of children and families at this moment. Our 
                          schools have been a source of support during this awful time. Please don't make us move.

                         Our elementary school does not offer level IV AAP services, and this is a problem that leads to flight of 
                          students in 3rd grade and decreased enrollment. It also in my opinion detracts from the level of education 
                          that is offered at our school because in effect there is a "brain drain."  
                         Our family just spent 9 months waiting on a home and spent hundreds of thousands of additional dollars 
                          just to purchase in this school pyramid. We would like flexible options for those of us who are already 
                          settled in this district. 
                         Our high school pyramid (South Lakes) hasn't been reviewed in more than a decade. For kids looking for 
                          diverse courses including AP, there are no good options in comparison to other schools such as Chantilly & 
                          Westfield HSs 
                         Our home was subject to the change Mclean-Langley. I support keeping primary school kids together for 
                          MS/HS, but students subject to these changes should have had a choice of what school to attend. Our 
                          neighborhood now has families who have to deal with multiple high schools within the same family. 
                         Our lives in FFX Cty are severely impacted by traffic and congestion. Getting to school should not be 
                          long/difficult for most students (some exceptions, like TJ). It seems like we already have a lot of diversity 
                          here in our neighborhoods. Why would diversity be a good reason to change boundaries? 
                         Our local elementary school greatly increased in size due to making it an AAP site. Students chose to leave 
                          their base school, making it underpopulated. Transportation became a nightmare and my child rode for 1 
                          hour. The trip is 6 minutes to school. AAP needs to be offered in base schools.  
                         Our military families already move enough.  
                         Our neighborhood and community is very important. Dividing our community, busing our children outside 
                          of our community destroys our neighborhoods. Building a world that is better for our children begins with 
                          our neighborhoods, libraries restaurants, grocery stores. Taking away schools divide destroy 
                         Our neighborhood goes to different schools. One is fairfax pyramid and one is Robinson. For us to go to 
                          fairfax high we have to pass Robinson. We also have centreville high next to us but can’t attend. We 
                          shouldn’t be driving to fairfax city  
                         Our Pyramid goes Willow Spings/Lanier/Fairfax - Willow Springs is in our neighborhood but Lanier and 
                          Fairfax are in Fairfax City 15/30 minutes away instead of them going to Liberty 5 min away or even Rocky 
                          Run Middle 10 min. Centerville and ChantillyHigh are closer to us than FairfaxHigh.  
                         Our recent house purchase was directly related to the current local school attendance. Change anything 
                          will greatly affect real estate values. (four responses) 
                         Our school district has plenty of diversity. But apparently not the diversity a bunch of rich white people 
                          think. Ridiculous. Leave the boundaries alone. If you really want, split up FCPS itself because it’s so large 
                          and poorly maintained.  
                         Our schools are already diverse and I am concerned that one of the options/preferences is to create schools 
                          that reflect the diversity in Fairfax County. We should not be bussing kids all over the County just to ensure 
                          socioeconomic equity.  
                         Our schools are tied to the community here in Vienna. My children see the same kids at school, in sports 
                          activities and around town. We moved here specifically to give our kids the opportunity to grow up in a 
                          place with a strong sense of community. It would be heartbreaking if FCPS destroys this. 
                         Our SE boundaries have been frozen for too long after 80s closures. We need new school construction and 
                          boundary realignment. Students west of RT 1 shouldn't be shipped across a busy highway, high schools are 
                          lopsided, and kids can't walk to their local schools.The WP pyramid is a sprawling mess.

                                                                                         FAIRFAX SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIALS 
                         Overcrowded schools often seem to reflect the simple fact that a large number of families with school age 
                          kids live in that neighborhood. This should always be expected as a possibility and those families should be 
                          served by having schools that can accommodate their children. 
                         Overcrowding is the biggest issue with FCPS right now. The boundary policy needs to be flexible and quick 
                          enough to actually make changes that affect enrollment in a timely manner. 
                         parents are current students should be given ample opportunities to make choices if there is a boundary 
                          change. It is especially important to keep the children in a specific school (esp HS) if they have attended 2 
                          yrs or more; we moved into a place for my child to attend a specific school. 
                         Parents are going to be angry no matter what. There will be push back esp from well off areas like Langley. 
                          FCPS needs to grow a spine and do what’s best for all kids.  
                         Parents are paying for the neighborhoods and schools that they live in. If you want more equitable 
                          education then do YOUR part and make ALL schools/programming equitable. Don't punish us or our 
                          children for living in certain neighborhoods. 
                         Parents buy homes with the expectation of their child attending a specific school, that needs to remain an 
                          option even if boundaries change.  
                         Parents of Fairfax County Schools should be offered some flexibility in where their children attend school; 
                          because there may be some who are willing to send their children to certain schools further away. And 
                          other parents may value distance, or programs offered, or diversity, differently.  
                         Parents should be surveyed as to whether or not they’d be interested in changing schools, if it would impact 
                          them. Before boundaries are drawn Sue when the potentially impacted families.  
                         Parents  should  establish  what  constitutes  a  neighborhood/community  area.  Because  base 
                          schools/pyramids are a major factor in home pricing/purchasing decisions, boundary adjustments should 
                          always be a LAST case scenario; only implemented for consistent extreme overcrowding where building 
                          isn't poss. 
                         Parents should have a choice in elementary schools. There are 3 within walking distance of my house and 
                          we are at the largest one.  
                         Parents should have greater control over the schools their children attend in within the Fairfax County 
                          School District. Decisions should not be imposed on families and students. 
                         Parents should have option to enroll kids in schools closer to work locations for easier pick up and drop off. 
                         Parents who opt into remaining in their existing schools after a boundary change should be responsible for 
                          providing transportation (or paying additional fees to pay for the cost of county provided transportation). 
                         Parents will freak out about this but it’s the least expensive way to maximize the value of our existing 
                          education investments, if and only if FCPS keeps its social engineering priorities out of this process.  
                         Part of the problem has been kids who attend advanced academics at Riverside Elementary, followed by 
                          Carl Sandburg, then are told the only option is MVHS unless they want to get the IB diploma. Once the 
                          children form an academic peer group for years its unconscionable to rip them away in 9th grade 
                         People buy homes because of the school their kids will go to (K-12). Hence, changing boundaries and forcing 
                          them to move doesn't really solve the issue. If you chose which school based on school to student/parent 
                          needs, that would be best. 
                         People buy homes in school districts for that specific school. You cannot just change the boundaries.

                                                                                         FAIRFAX SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIALS 
                         People buy homes with the high school in mind. Changing the high school after a home is purchased is very 
                          difficult to manage. I think one should be able to attend the school that was assigned when the home was 
                          purchased. 
                         People buy houses based on which schools their children will attend. Those people should be grandfathered 
                          into the school if a boundary change is made 
                         People buy houses to go to specific schools. Disrupting that will just mean those students attend private 
                          schools, losing FCPS money in the process.  
                         People choose to buy homes based on the school that their child will attend. As such, any changes (which 
                          may be needed to promote diversity and reduce crowding), should allow families the option of keeping 
                          their child in the school they are in. 
                         People flock to good schools and schools with special programs. Changing boundaries to correct this 
                          <problem= is ludicrous. People will follow the good programs and we will have to change boundaries again. 
                          DONT CHANGE THE BOUNDARIES, improve the schools programs that are underfilled.  
                         People invest money to be in the particular school zone and school specific area. So we should not change 
                          their base school on other factors or we should given resident a choice to continue going to old / earlier 
                          school wherever they are enrolled before boundary change happened.  
                         People made significant investments of their hard earned dollars to buy or rent in the bets area they could 
                          for them and their kids education. Politics should not play into any boundary changes for the imagined 
                          reasons of "equity" and "fairness". Keep boundaries where they are now.   
                         People make huge sacrifices to put their kids in desirable schools. Boundary changes should not effect kids 
                          who are already in their chosen school pyramid.  
                         People move into neighborhoods of certain values, knowing that their children will be a part of that certain 
                          school pyramid. Changes in boundaries will cause home values to drop. School construction to add space 
                          at existing schools, or new schools construction should be the top priority.   
                         People move to houses within a specific boundary to go to a specific school. If things change there is no 
                          incentive to buy in a specific area. Those of us who choose to limit our home search to a small area should 
                          not be penalized by being sent to a different school in the future. 
                         People move to the neigborhoods for the schools, changing the boundaries will bankrupt all these families. 
                         People moved based on schools. Families need notice so they can prepare their students for any changes. 
                          It isn't fair to families to be have houses zoned to particular schools & then have the boundaries changed 
                          on short notice. Property values very much relate to schools. 
                         People purchase houses for specific schools. This should be respected while trying to balance overcrowding. 
                         People purchase houses in Fairfax County, a suburb of the DC Metro area, to a great extent, based on the 
                          school tier their children will attend. If you plan to make changes, you must do so very slowly. People have 
                          made life term investments in their decisions.  
                         People purchase their homes based on where the schools are. By changing boundaries, you are changing 
                          the value of homes. While I understand the population changes, it would be helpful to keep homes assigned 
                          to their current schools so it does not impact real estate value. 
                         People should be able to choose their school. That will help ensure that all the schools provide a high quality 
                          education. 
                         People specifically choose their homes based on schools. If a child is already in a pyramid, they should not 
                          have to change schools due to boundary changes.

                         People spend extra money to move into specific neighborhoods and fcps shouldn't casually alter settled 
                          expectations without significant public input and lengthy advance notice.  
                         People spend their life's saving to buy a house so their kids can go to a good school. Changing the boundary 
                          could detail their family life and children's education!!!  
                         People who move to a particular neighborhood to attend a particular school should not have that choice 
                          altered by boundary changes. 
                         People will be opposed to moving out of current pyramids to lower-performing schools. It makes more 
                          sense to spend a few years targeting those schools to lift them up, thereby making them more desirable. 
                         People would not care so much about what boundary they are and if the schools had adequate funding and 
                          building updates as a whole. Just because someone’s median income is lower does not mean that their 
                          children Should attend and outdated antiquated and frankly run down school. 
                         Phasing in must apply to families, not just individual students so that families don't have siblings stretched 
                          out across multiple schools.  
                         Please address out of district transportation for schools with specialized programs (in our case German 
                          immersion. We live a stone’s throw from the boundary line and I’m required to drive my kids to and from 
                          school daily. Also, younger siblings should get a fair chance at entering the same school. 
                         Please allow all current students to stay in their school. Changing school's would be particularly detrimental 
                          to my student with special needs.  
                         Please  allow  transfers  for  academic  programs  in  more  high  schools  (AP,  IB).  Students  shouldn't  be 
                          constrained to the program of their base school that the only way to change is to move the whole family.  
                         Please bring back some of the single family neighborhoods cut out of Annandale HS boundaries, now its 
                          under enrolled and Canterbury ES, Woodson HS, Falls Church HS (?) are over enrolled - robbed Annandale 
                          and reinforces bad reputation  
                         Please build a new building for McLean High School and ensure contractors with construction contracts 
                          within McLean boundaries helps pay for new school construction, and remove the temp. bldgs from MHS 
                          tennis courts. Please. 
                         Please check current students’ residency for correct boundary. Also if all ES and MS have level IV aap center 
                          then this boundary issue will solve!  
                         Please consider boundary adjustments *before* a school passes 120% capacity (unless there is a near-term 
                          addition/expansion planned).  
                         Please consider changing the borders to keep kids from schools together in middle ans high school.  
                         Please consider changing the boundary of Lewis hs please. We live so far away from the school and are 
                          actually  physically  closer  to  a  couple  other  high  schools.  It  is  a  hassle  to  get  my  daughter  to  school 
                          sometimes due to the distance.  
                         Please consider changing the middle / high school for Willow Springs ES - Fairfax HS is very far, especially 
                          since the boundary for Willow Springs extends westward towards Centreville HS. 
                         Please consider creating more AAP and/or immersion programs at schools, so that students do not have to 
                          move to "center" schools. 
                         Please consider keeping siblings at same school  
                         Please consider keeping students in neighborhood high schools. Our current high school is 10 highway miles 
                          away and we have 2 neighborhood high schools about 5 local street miles away. Very frustrating.

                         Please consider planned new housing too. 
                         PLEASE consider policy that allows current students to STAY in the pyramid if they choose. We sacrifice to 
                          buy homes in the school boundaries we desire. And it is so so so stressful to the students as they become 
                          anxious about possibly switching schools. Consider gradual enrollment transitions. 
                         Please Consider that some people purchased their home with the desire to attend a specific, elementary, 
                          middle and high school for their children and are not happy about a boundary change  
                         Please consider the impact on home values and taxable assessments of neighborhoods associated with high 
                          performing schools when considering school boundaries if rezoned to a lower performing school zone  
                         Please consider to make boundary changes to improve Poe middle school and Falls Church high school 
                          ratings. Also, please consider adding 6th grade to Mason Crest elementary school. This school is currently 
                          under capacity and students have to transfer to middle school after 5th grade 
                         Please continue to address overcrowding at Longfellow and Mclean High.  
                         Please do not call latin people latinx. As a latino I'm insulted that's a made up democratic woke word that 
                          is very insulting to latin people. That should be removed from this survey. 
                         Please do not change the boundaries according to test scores. Please do not change boundaries of a 
                          successful school, so that FCPS can "even the playing field" in terms of transferring high achieving students 
                          to a school with low test scores.  
                         Please  do  not  change  the  boundary  for  our  high  school.  We  specifically  chose  this  house  and  this 
                          neighborhood to go to this high school. We specifically did not move so that our kids could stay with their 
                          friends. 
                         Please do not diminish my property value by changing the school boundaries. My family paid a premium 
                          for our housing in a specific HS Pyramid. We work extra jobs to afford our house. We are counting on high 
                          resale value for retirement. Changing boundaries now takes money out of our wallets.

                         Please do not force any child to go to schools other than those the parents essentially opted into when they 
                          purchased their house (thru HS). If you feel you absolutely need to change boundaries this should only 
                          affect students not currently <grandfathered= into the current school pyramid.  
                         please do not make it worse!  
                         Please do not move children away from a school they already attend, it's often a very scary experience. Also 
                          allow rising younger siblings to attend same school or many families will not be able to manage. 
                         Please do your research BEFORE recommending any changes and make it a priority to distribute resources 
                          equally, not based on zip code. EVERY child in the county should have EQUAL access to an elite education 
                          no matter the zip code. Realize white flight is real, red-lining is real, racism is real. 
                         Please don’t allow parents to decide they don’t want their kids to go to the base school and make up a 
                          reason why they need a certain foreign language for their kid just so they move their kid to a school they 
                          feel is <better <. 
                         Please don’t change my boundaries. I picked this home specifically for the schools for my kids. I’d prefer 
                          not to have to move.  
                         Please don’t change our kids Langley pyramid. We have spent a lot of money to come to Langley district.

                          Overcrowding hurts all students, but especially poorer kids.  
                         Please don’t force children to travel long distances to go to school for the sake of achieving other goals. 
                         Please don’t make people go past school to attend one that is further (eg, those walkable to ES, MS, and 
                          high school shouldn’t go past these walkable schools to attend another). Also, islands seem like low hanging 
                          fruit.  
                         Please don’t remove students from the crowded schools that don’t want to leave.  
                         Please don't change the boundary for the next 3years. To keep my son in Woodson high, I have to buy a 
                          expensive house to remain in the boundary. 
                         Please eliminate split feeder schools. Allow students who attend an ES to track with their classmates into 
                          MS/HS.  
                         Please ensure equity and socio-economic balancing, stop the consolidation of all the whites/asians. Like 
                          with the Woodson and Annandale HS boundary shift in 2011. The white kids and minorities all lost in that 
                          shift. Make decisions that lift everyone up. 
                         Please ensure that whatever policy is implemented embraces diversity, equity, and inclusion.  
                         PLEASE fix the imbalance of school capacity in FCPS! Boundary charges are likely the most cost-effective 
                          way of doing this. It would elevate so many other issues (long bus rides, under/over capacity) and would 
                          allow for more $$ for special programs in schools and support the One Fairfax Policy!  
                         Please fix the Shrevewood overcrowding issue ASAP. We don't want a new school in 5-7 years, we want 
                          boundary changes now. PLEASE boundary changes NOW for Shrevewood.  
                         Please focus on AAP Referrals,parents don’t have proper or accurate information about AAP,the most 
                          talented students are left behind,school based AAP is very biased and only those students get in whose 
                          parents are staff members or somehow <know= the staff member.  
                         Please focus on STEM and advanced math, science and english. No diversity training NO racially decisive 
                          material and no to confusing our children with gender studies please. Thank you. 
                         Please give more flexibility to parents to choose between schools that are within a certain radius of each 
                          other. 
                         Please give students within a certain radius of two middle schools or high schools a choice.  
                         Please have any boundary changes apply ONLY to new students.  
                         Please have equal consideration for all families in FCPS and do not disregard the impact to families who 
                          researched and purchased homes in pyramids with academically high ranking schools. The focus should be 
                          on increasing resources for underperforming schools, not boundary adjustments. 
                         Please keep in Mind about student’s travel time does not equate to distance but road condition and traffic.  
                         Please keep in mind that changes in boundaries may, in some instances, negatively affect home valuation.  
                         Please keep our neighborhoods together and do not divide the kids. Students that have the means will 
                          withdraw and go to private schools if they don’t like their new base school and FCPS will lose even more 
                          enrollment.

                                                                                         FAIRFAX SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIALS 
                         Please keep Springvale Road residents in the Langley Pryamid. Move the other homes that are by Holly 
                          Knoll out of the Langley Pryamid. Springvale Rd is on the same road as the observatory (where all the 
                          neighbors celebrate 4th July) it’s on the same road as Chez Francois where we all celebrate even 
                         PLEASE let families and kids have some amount of choice when deciding who is going with new boundaries. 
                          And please be generous to people who want to be grandfathered. All of my friends in the GT program left 
                          Hughes for Carson when it opened. It made my anxiety worse and led to long-term depression.  
                         Please look at the map and stop the attendance islands. Stop protecting majority white schools by carefully 
                          drawing boundary lines to ensure lower income populations are excluded. It is undeniable when you look 
                          at the map.  
                         Please make Lorton Station NOT a Title 1 school and diversify the population. People with kids are moving 
                          out of our neighborhood because it is a title 1 school. This is creating a bad reputation for the school within 
                          the single family home community. We love the school and want people to stay. 
                         Please plan on building new schools/extensions to current schools rather than change boundaries. Changing 
                          boundaries should be the very last resort. The vast majority of real estate purchases have been made based 
                          on assigned schools; changing the school could potentially severely impact asset value 
                         Please please normalize elementary school start and ending times. The 9-4 schedule is too hard on kids and 
                          parents and unfair for these schools as it pertains to a lack of child care options near the school.  
                         Please publish and circulate the results of the survey. Thanks 
                         Please realize that parents have worked very hard and stretched their last dollar to buy into a good school 
                          pyramid. Any boundary changes should, at the very minimum, grandfather in currently enrolled kids 
                          through high school years. 
                         Please reduce the reliance on home location for determine school attendance and transportation options. 
                          Families look different and work differently now, and school options should reflect this. Further, opening 
                          schools to all across the county would encourage diversity and strengthen social skills. 
                         Please seriously consider eliminating split feeder schools (such as Olde Creek ES), all students from one ES 
                          school should feed into the same MS/HS. 
                         Please specify in the policy what concrete metrics will be used for any future boundary reviews/changes. 
                          Please  specify  in  the  new  policy  the  role  that  community  input  will  have  in  any  future  boundary 
                          review/changes. 
                         Please specify in the policy what concrete metrics will be used for any future boundary reviews/changes. 
                          Please  specify  in  the  new  policy  the  role  that  community  input  will  have  in  any  future  boundary 
                          review/changes. 
                         Please stop trying to socially engineer schools not deemed sufficiently "diverse." Boundaries should be 
                          based on simple geography, and not any other criteria. 
                         Please take into consideration the split feeder schools are not good for the mental health of students, for 
                          them to be split from peers. Additionally, the special education students should remain with their peers, or 
                          given an exception even if assigned boundary is different from peers.  
                         Please think about the current students and not play politics with boundaries. 
                         Please think carefully before making any change. People in this area work very hard and plan their lives 
                          around areas for their kids to go to school. If we are going to be sent to schools farther away, we do not 
                          want that.

                         Please try to avoid eliminating or reducing the amount of public parks/green spaces when increasing school 
                          property and make sure any plans are made easily available and understandable to the public. 
                         Please try to avoid eliminating or reducing the amount of public parks/green spaces when increasing school 
                          property and make sure any plans are made easily available and understandable to the public. 
                         Please understand that MANY people (myself included) look for a residence within the boundaries of a 
                          specific high school. Families with young kids who purchase a home 10 or more years out will be extremely 
                          disappointed if the school assignment were to change. 
                         politics should not enter the decision process, get/keep student numbers low to allow all students more 
                          one on one time  
                         Poll #7 should have None of the above option 
                         Population fluctuates due to military assignments, don't be so quick to change a physical boundary. Be more 
                          flexible with schools within the existing boundaries. 
                         Population growth is a concern that needs to be addressed with new schools. Boundaries should lead to 
                          least disruption to existing students in High School pyramids and smartly manage transportation so that a 
                          cluster of close neigborhoods feed into one or two high school pyramids only 
                         Por el mometo todo esta bien, la atenciÃ³n en la escuela siga siendo exelente, gracias  
                         Por lo del COVID ay muchos padres que prefieren que sus hijos estÃ©n en casa pueden tomar en cuenta 
                          eso para bajar la sobre poblaciÃ³n en las escuelas o clos niÃ±os que no estÃ¡n vacunado que tomen sus 
                          clases virtuales para q asÃ- tambiÃ©n no corran riesgo de enfermarse 
                         Poverty considerations should be implemented into boundary policies. Poverty should be equally dispersed 
                          throughout the district, or at least no more than 30% of a school's population should be impoverished. 
                          Having schools with 5% poverty rates compared to those with 60% or more is not equitable. 
                         Prior boundary changes were not transparent. McL students should be allowed to go to Langley. McL HS 
                          should be fast tracked for total refurbishment. It is embarassing that Langley was completely refurbished 
                          and McL languishes. It smacks of those with money get what they want. 
                         Property taxes support education and parent(s) chose to live in a certain area based on school(s) to be 
                          attended. For brand new developments or long term valid changes in the population build or augment 
                          existing schools  
                         property values based on school boundaries are a major factor contributing to decision making 
                         Property values in certain areas of the county are highly tied to the high school for which it's zoned. There 
                          should never be a high school change, only potentially the building of a new high school in the same area 
                          with the same demographic mix of kids.  
                         Provide programming to meet the needs of community in areas with limited resources (i.e. provide AAP, 
                          enrichment, and community based services) rather than bussing kids to other neighborhood schools where 
                          families can not access schools easily.  
                         Proximity and travel time have legitimate roles in school boundary determination. Ethnicity should not play 
                          a role here. 
                         Proximity to the school should be the first consideration because traffic here is so bad. The closer kids can 
                          be to their schools the better for efficiency for them & for everyone else in the area.  
                         Punishing one child to <reward= another in the name of so called <equity= is a ridiculous proposition 
                          especially coming from an adult.

                                                                                         FAIRFAX SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIALS 
                         Put  10  times  more  resources  into  addressing  staffing/leadership  issues  in  failing  schools  instead  of 
                          boundary  changes/studies/disruption.  Instead  of  changing  boundaries,  look  at  the  schools  with  low 
                          enrollment and address possible staffing issues that may be the cause. 
                         Race and income should not be considered and students should not be bussed in to create diversity ratios 
                         race and social status should not be a consideration. the boundary policy does not need to be changed. 
                         Race definition for Latins is confusing. Since being a person of Latin descend means having a mother tonge 
                          originating from Latin (Spanish, Portuguese, Romanian, French, Italian) and a culture derived from specific 
                          set of traditions etc. Or geographical location. None of your descriptors are geneti 
                         Race, income, and other non-educational factors have no place in this analysis. 
                         Rapid and dynamic population growth should dictate the need for more frequent review and changes to 
                          boundaries 
                         Rather than shuffle students around to cover up gaps in learning (even before Covid), move your teachers 
                          to under performing schools. Bussing students across the county will not make up for lack of support at 
                          home. Stop wasting money on <One Fairfax= and start spending it on the students.  
                         Real estate is a big deal in this area.People buy&sell houses based on +/- school ratings&reputation.Many 
                          people stretch their budgets OR cram large/multiple families into a small space just to get their children 
                          into a school with a good reputation. Also,kids know when they are bussed in,been there 
                         Real estate is very expensive in Fairfax County. Many people choose homes specifically for certain pyramids. 
                          Any change to boundaries needs to "grandfather" those families into the boundary plan.  
                         Real estate values are closely tethered to schools. People who have lived and invested in a school district 
                          should not have their biggest investment disrupted lightly or often. But the disparity between Langley and 
                          McLean shocked me -- why flimsy temporary structures at MHS with LHS unfilled?? 
                         Realigning boundaries can potentially have a dramatic negative impact on home values that should not be 
                          discounted. 
                         Really need to look at school distance. We live on western side of Fairfax and my daughter who went to 
                          Fairfax HS. It is not uncommon to take an hour or more to drop off or pick up from school. It restricted her 
                          after school activity options. 
                         Redrawing of boundaries under the guise of inclusion and diversity is wrong. That is not how you accomplish 
                          those things.  
                         -Reduce bus transit time - Allow students to attend schools that are closer in vicinity of their home - Allow 
                          students to 'easily' transfer to another nearby school (this currently happens in LCPS) 
                         Reduce/eliminate  the  requirement  for  a  student  to  change  schools.  Changing  schools  can  be  very 
                          disruptive.  
                         Reducing the commute is important as kids have to wake up early to commute to school 
                         Remove the ability for parents to choose a level IV AAP center school over the local Level IV base school. 
                          They are the exact same program and the choice hurts base school enrollment and uses bus resources.  
                         Remove the nonsense boundery policy. Every student and parent should given the right to choose their 
                          desired school. This policy is just for seperating low from high income which is indeed a Discrimination.My 
                          little sister is not satisfied with her school and I can't enroll her to a different one. 
                         Remove trailers, when possible build new infrastructure

                         Removing specialty programs should not be considered.  
                         Reopen Clifton Elementary. Closing it was politically motivated and was one of the worst decisions ever in 
                          the history of FCPS. Omeish and Cohen need to go. They should resign. 
                         replace older schools that have been overpopulated and uses trailers for many years like McLean HS. The 
                          order of rebuilding schools should not be based only on age, priority should be given to those that are most 
                          overpopulated with students. 
                         Reshuffling schools is political and disgusting. It is disruptive to kids who have IEP. They are the most 
                          vulnerable kids who need consistency. Changing their environment is will have consequences on test scores.  
                         Review  boundaries  as  necessary.  Change  boundaries  every  11+  years  or  greater,  unless  absolutely 
                          necessary.  
                         Review the boundary every year and change it as necessary or every 2-4 years. 
                         Rezone between Chantilly and Fairfax. Many on the border of Fairfax are zoned to Fairfax HS, which is more 
                          than 20 minutes away before taking into account bus stops. 
                         Right now high school boundaries are not following the distance. Boundary changes should consider travel 
                          distance. 
                         Rising 11th and rising 12th graders should have the option to stay at current high school or move to newly 
                          assigned high school.  
                         Rising seniors :12th graders absolutely MUST REMAIN at their current school. Would be cruel and ridiculous 
                          to have Seniors move to another school their Senior year!!! 
                         Rocky Run Middle School should be the AAP Center School for Oak Hill Elementary and Lees Corner 
                          Elementary neighborhoods because it is in the Chantilly Pyramid and those kids attending the AAP center 
                          will continue on with classmates to Chantilly HS, instead of the center being Rachel Carson MS. 
                         Save money in the decision making. Kids in a current pyramid should not be forced to change unless they 
                          want to <¦. Buying a house in a pyramid should count for something. 
                         SB members should not be allowed to drive boundary changes for their own areas as they are not impartial 
                          and have personal motivation competing against what is best for the county. Should also bear in mind 
                          boundaries have been changed in the past so existing boundaries are not sacred and set. 
                         School assignments should also be reflective of the voting district. Tired of having no representation. 
                          Residing in one district and having my child’s schools in two other voting districts. 
                         School attendance creates neighborhood cohesion. Rather than disrupt lives of many families, FCPS should 
                          build additional buildings to manage overcrowding. District has plenty of money and it should not disrupt 
                          student attendance at school assigned to them.  
                         School attendance should be primarily geographically based. Additional programs to encourage attendance 
                          at other schools should be voluntary.  
                         School boundaries are about natural proximity. Creating unnatural boundaries to meet diversity goals or 
                          make lower performing schools better by changing feeder schools will drive families out of FCPS. If a top 
                          school has space, create opt in/test in options. Look at Boston for inspiration.  
                         School boundaries have a huge impact in property values. Keeping them constant is important to the 
                          communities, both those who have been here previously and those moving in. Children should NOT have 
                          long bus rides to get to their assigned school.

                                                                                         FAIRFAX SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIALS 
                         School boundaries must be dynamic to reflect the dynamic geographical population growth and shifts of 
                          school aged children.  
                         School boundaries should be adjusted to reflect neighborhoods/school districts and especially to decrease 
                          student overcrowding.  
                         School boundaries should be designed so that they cover the closest geography and reduce travel time.  
                          You go to schools where you live.  The survey questions are VERY POORLY DESIGNED and in some cases 
                          deliberately steering to a result.  Independent review of survey needed.  Very unfortunate. 
                         School boundaries should not be changed to address issues with poor performing schools. 
                         School boundary adjustments should be implemented with the goal of preserving the expectations of a 
                          family as they moved into a neighborhood since those decisions often factor in the school that the kids 
                          attend. Rebalancing should be infrequent and done only after exhausting all other options.  
                         School boundary change is not good for kids as they don’t feel comfortable in new environment  
                         School boundary changes affect not only families with children attending schools, but families that have 
                          invested in properties that are attached to a desire school and therefore their cost is higher. Nobody buys 
                          a house short term thinking. Changing school boundaries affect people’s investments. 
                         School boundary changes impact kids as well as the value of real estate, so double whammies. Kids currently 
                          enrolled in specific school pyramids should be allowed to remain in them if they’d prefer to do so. 
                         School boundary changes should only be made based on capacity and all other options are exhausted. 
                          Federal laws prohibit discrimination based on a person's national origin, race, color, religion, disability, sex, 
                          and familial status. Any such factors should not be part of boundary change decisions. 
                         school bus should be provided to transferred students 
                         School districts should be compared to demographics every year, and boundaries adjusted as needed. FCPS 
                          makes the rules. Don't try to accommodate special requests -- you'll never please everyone. All FCPS schools 
                          should be of equal quality and equally attractive to students and families. 
                         School is huge factor for home purchases and rentals. This needs to be an easy to find database if new 
                          students will need to attend a different school than current residents. 1-2yr lead time also needs to be 
                          advertised unless students can be grandfathered in.  
                         School lied and said no boundary changes were in the process. This is the process to change boundaires 
                          based on false narrative of One Fairfax. Fcps schools have plenty of diversity. Stop lying school board to we 
                          parents. No boundary changes! 
                         School of choice within the district as long as the parent can get the students to school without additional 
                          transportation needed from the district 
                         School officials should not be bullied into making or not making changes. People are always unhappy at first 
                          and these things work themselves out  
                         School overcrowding is also affected by students under special request by parents to attend the school. 
                          Eliminating these special requests will alleviate crowding. Especially at the "sought after" high schools. You 
                          want your child to attend that school-purchase a home within that boundary. Period 
                         School pyramid is one of the single most important factors for many families when purchasing a home in 
                          Fairfax County. It would be incredibly unfair to change the boundary is students were moved to a different 
                          pyramid partial way through. 
                                      Fairfax County Public Schools  December 9, 2021                            P a g e  | 125

                                                                                         FAIRFAX SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIALS 
                         School pyramid should not be changed at middle and high school level. All new students to fcps should be 
                          enrolled in new boundary schools so they know in advance what schools they r moving into.  
                         School selection should be more flexible. Colorado allows students to enroll in any school they want. There 
                          should be more options, like hybrid schools, home schools, and regular schools all offered by district to 
                          meet every kid and family need.  
                         School success is a result of the families and students that go there. Stop trying to game the system by 
                          spreading out poor performers. Allow schools to be a representation of the community/neighborhood they 
                          are in. Invest in poor performing schools, offer more before and after school programs. 
                         School  zoning  dramatically  impacts  our  property  value.  "Struggling"  schools  need  to  be  improved. 
                          Meanwhile rezoning can have strong negative financial impacts and will face strong opposition from 
                          affected persons. 
                         Schools are extremely overcrowded. The student-to-teach ratio should be lot better. There should not be 
                          more than 12-15 students with 1 teacher in 1 class. It is extremely unfair that parents who pay lot higher 
                          property tax are getting the same service for their kids as those who pay lot less.  
                         Schools should also consider issues that may arise for working parents to ensure that children are in school 
                          near to their homes, particularly for emergency situations and needing to pick up children. The parent's 
                          workplace and commute is a significant consideration in selecting a home in this area. 
                         Schools should be community-based. Surveying all of Fairfax County is not representative of what individual 
                          communities want. Each community should decide how it wants to handle over/under-crowding. 
                         Schools should be diverse across the county. Kids from lower Socioeconomic neighborhoods should have 
                          the opportunity to go to the highest rate schools, even if the only answer is to bus them there. 
                         Schools  should  be  neighborhood  schools.  Kids  SHOULD  NOT  be  bussed  in  from  outside  of  school 
                          boundaries. That makes zero sense.  
                         Schools should be part of their immediate neighborhoods and boundaries should honor this. 
                         Schools should take into account students' emotional needs when redefining boundaries. Many students 
                          thrive in familiar environments and struggle to adjust when transferred to a new school due to boundary 
                          changes or a family move to a school zone outside former boundaries. 
                         Schools that have been last to be renovated and have history poor conditions should be able to be improved 
                          more than just the last school to be renovated 
                         Seems like a pretty simple problem here, Langley doesn't have enough kids, and mclean has too many, 
                          move the boundary, allow the kids currently in High School to stay at their current school, all kids rising into 
                          middle, or high school should go to their newly assigned school. 
                         Seems the same schools are realigned multiple times. buy more buses  
                         Separate Mt. Vernon and West Potomac from FCPS. We are not considered in the county in a meaningful 
                          way and the system is too big. There is tremendous construction down here even though the schools are 
                          overcrowded already. No plan to deal with it. Really uninspiring. 
                         Several schools are terribly overcrowded, including McLean High School and Longfellow Middle School - 
                          this creates stress for teachers, students and faculty - some more than others. It seems like the fastest 
                          change is either new construction or boundary changes.  
                         Shame on the school board for allowing this to become the issue it has. Monitoring population growth and 
                          school size to determine impact to capability and capacity is a basic function in proper management.

                         Should be announced with several years notice as some people specially pick housing based off of assigned 
                          schools.  
                         Should be mandatory to shift when transitioning from elementary to middle and middle to high school. One 
                          of your options may address this, but it’s unclear 
                         Should not be forced on any current enrolled students  
                         Should only affect new student, not existing ones. Families would have a tought time adjusting 
                         Shouldn’t be schools with big feeder imbalances(like HS with 80% from one MS).Not sure of the correct %, 
                          but prob shouldn’t be more than 2/3 from any one school.Edison has an attendance island that affects 
                          students even though FCPS says there’s no island.No crossing highways unless no other option. 
                         Shrevewood  Elementary  is  overcrowded.  700  children  attend  that  school.  Building  new  trails  at 
                          overcrowded schools leads to loss of outdoor play space.  
                         Shrevewood use to not be over populated or have bad ratings. The increase/overflow in students must be 
                          the direct reason students do not get the needed attention therefore causing lower testing.  
                         Sibling placement should be considered so siblings are not separated to different schools in a phased 
                          boundary change. Boundary changes to reduce overcrowding should heavily weighted proximity to school 
                          and to reduce commute times.  
                         Siblings should be kept at the same school as older siblings at their school to prevent splitting families.  
                         Signal Hill is an island attending Ravensworth ES (Kings Park/Glen are closer). The AAP students go to Keene 
                          Mill AAP (White Oaks is closer). In 7th grade the students at KMES are split between Irving and LBSS. They 
                          are split again for high school if they do AP at LBSS and have to go back to W Spr 
                         Significant investment is made to buy into a school pyramid. Enrolled students should not be forcibly 
                          transferred to a new school due to new boundaries 
                         Significant investment is made to buy into a school pyramid. Enrolled students should not be forcibly 
                          transferred to a new school due to new boundaries.  
                         Simple is better - keep any changes simple, logical and obvious to explain 
                         Simply put to have students attending to the closest schools where they live now. 
                         So far so good 
                         So long as kids do not have to change their current school, they should be required to change their next 
                          school (e.g., they can stay in their current middle school but will relocate for high school). It might be good 
                          to have a year or two phase in. 
                         So many of these options or answers I don’t really understand the impact or what would happen. 
                         Socioeconomic diversity should be the primary factor in decision making regarding diversity. Factoring in 
                          race as this survey does by its questions regarding race is simply racist.  
                         Some boundary lines do not make sense, and cross major roads to get to needing car or bus transportation. 
                          New roads open up and have been open ex, Jeff Todd Way, and another school pyramid become closer. 
                          Would like to revisit boundary lines for shorter transportation and less traffic.  
                         Some neighborhoods have messed up boundaries <=example <=ES splits into 2 feeder school, MS splits to 2 
                          HS. Programs such as AAP should exist in all MSs <=messed up how kids move out of a pyramid.

                         Some of our school@s students are in the bus longer than 39 minutes to and from school. This distance 
                          discourages  certain  families  from  attending  additional  functions  at  school  and  disenfranchises  those 
                          families from truly being part of the school community.  
                         Some of us bought the house specific to the school boundaries, bc even within Fairfax county, there are 
                          difference between schools, and I'll be disappointed if my house is re-zoned to less desirable school in the 
                          future. 
                         Some people have purchased homes at an expensive price to ensure their child attends a specific school 
                          due to the recent hot real estate market. For some parents school choice was priority. Changing that will 
                          not be good for home owners vs renters so let people choose if boundaries are changed.  
                         Some people purchase homes based on school assignments; drastic changes to home values could occur 
                          with boundary reassignments and should be evaluated.  
                         Some schools are much larger than others. If you want larger schools or accommodate more kids, then 
                          these  older  and  smaller  sized  schools  need  to  be  renovated.  Take  care  of  teachers,  allow  for  more 
                          employment. Keep all programs  
                         Some students have a very difficult time with change. There should always be an option for current student 
                          to choose if they stay in their pyramid or move into the new base school based on changed boundaries. 
                         Sometimes with the truth we can go a long way. If certain schools are over crowded LET US KNOW which 
                          schools are over crowded. Put more trailers in the schools. The schools that are not over crowded let us 
                          know as well. So we can make informed decisions to protect the children and staff.  
                         South County HS boundary was drawn to avoid lower income areas that are very close to the school. Politics 
                          and money rather than equity prevailed. Will New boundaries also be determined to exclude 'less desirable' 
                          students from wealthier schools?? Shame on those who were a part of that decision.  
                         Special attention should be made to neighborhoods that are island neighborhoods traveling to schools far 
                          away, ie Hampton Chase to Fairfax HS. There is no reasonable explanation for this. It may have been 
                          necessary 30 years ago but it needs to be reevaluated! 
                         Spend the money to make good projections about this that are based on math and not parent politics. 
                         Spend the money. Re-do Mclean High School and this whole boundry issue goes away. Send the kids in 
                          Tysons to Marshall HS 
                         Spider-like boundaries that concentrate low income students in one school should be corrected  
                         Split pyramids are horrible. We purchased our home knowing it was a split pyramid at High School, BUT 
                          that transfers between Marshall & Madison were easy. Both schools have since closed transfers. High 
                          School students have to start with ZERO friends. Eliminate split pyramids&foster long-termfriends. 
                         split the school district - it is too big 
                         Stop all seperate schools and/or transfers to seperate schools for "gifted and talented," AP. etc. The former 
                          should be abolished -- it is an insult, as ALL students have gifts and talents, and it contributes to social 
                          inequities; and the latter should be offered in each school  
                         Stop assigning students to school outside their community neighborhoods.  
                         Stop being so political. Do the harder right instead of the easier wrong. 
                         Stop bussing in kids from the ghetto. People who have worked hard to provide a good life for their families 
                          should not have to send their children to school with the spawn of MS-13 thugs. There’s a reason why half 
                          of the families in the Mt Vernon district are in private schools FCPS has failed them!

                         Stop changing school boundaries to mask performance issues at under performing schools.  
                         Stop clustering IB in the lower ranked schools. It’s an expensive program with bad ROI. This just lets families 
                          pupil place elsewhere. All elementary and middle schools should have a Level IV program that should be 
                          ability tracked. Students who are two grade levels behind shouldn’t be in Gen Ed. 
                         Stop letting the rich people carve out lower SES neighborhoods and high density housing from their 
                          boundaries. The McLean HS district, in particular, is ridiculous.  
                         Stop making loopty-loop boundaries that pull out the one affluent neighborhood to another school from 
                          the one everyone around it attends. 
                         Stop making special schools like TJ! The AAP are for kids with very involved parents. Spend money on all 
                          the students. FOR SHAME FAIRFAX - WITH YOUR MONEY ALL SCHOOLS SHOULD BE THE TOP IN THE 
                          COUNTRY - FOR SHAME! 
                         Stop pushing for new boundaries and spend tax dollars on teachers, programs and supports. Don’t keep 
                          doing the same thing in veiled ways to get what you want. People buy where their preferred schools are. 
                          That’s our choice, not yours. Listen to your parents, not your PR firm/politics.

                         Stop talking about diversity, it's sickening. We all work hard to afford life in our neighborhoods. There is a 
                          reason why people choose to move to good naighborhoods: to let kids go to the good schools. Don't try to 
                          bring outsiders to us. You already screwed TJ, enough  
                         Stop the social engineering. Don’t treat the public like idiots. We evaluated the schools and choose to live 
                          where we wanted. You should not assume to know more than use what is best for our kids.  
                         Stop trying to create <diversity= in your wokeness. It degrades the rest of the school. Build schools and 
                          facilities to meet rising student populations. People move in to a region for specific reason of attending that 
                          school 
                         STOP trying to force "equity" (which is a race to the bottom) and "diversity" and use common sense. Focus 
                          on keeping children in school pyramids from K-12, and keep them as close to physical locations as possible. 
                          Stop playing political games with our children!  
                         Stop trying to hide FCPS mismanagement by re shuffling the deck. We can see what you're up to 
                         Stop wasting our money on these useless surveys 
                         Stop with the temporary structures. They are not safe in severe weather or first person shooter incidents 
                          (and sadly, both are increasing). Monitor overcrowded vs excess capacity schools and at least give the 
                          option to switch. Be sensitive to homes as retirement investments when making changes.  
                         Strive to make all bus routes 35 minutes or less and ensure fairness: do not have first picked up be the last 
                          dropped off. 
                         Students already attending their area schools should not be made to change schools because of new 
                          boundary changes. Any proposed changes should be for a future year. 
                         Students already in a school pyramid should not be forced to change to another once started- it is so 
                          incredibly disruptive to their support system and confidence to lose "their people": teachers, friends, etc. 
                          It could also force parents to move, which they may not be able to afford. 
                         students already in boundaries need to be able to remain at the school. I literally picked my location and 
                          overpay for the right to attend Oakton.

                         Students already in MS should be able to follow through on their choice of HS (pupil placement for IB, etc.) 
                          Kids in HS should not have to move schools. 
                         Students and siblings should be able to remain in the same school through high school 
                         Students attending schools on a military base (i.e. Fort Belvoir Elementary) should not have to attend school 
                          off base. I'd like to see a secondary school built on Fort Belvoir's military base. 
                         Students currently enrolled should have the choice to stay with their current school  
                         students currently in HS (9-12) should stay in their base school and should not be affected by the change. 
                          MS students going to another school (not their base school) to attend AAP program should go back to their 
                          base school.  
                         Students enrolled in the system should be offered stability whenever possible. They should be allowed to 
                          stay with friends in base/center schools whenever possible <=whether the student or boundary moves.  
                         Students enrolled in the system should be offered stability whenever possible. They should be allowed to

                         Students entering high school should have an option to choose IB or AP school.  
                         Students from the same family should bot be separated if boundary changes allow. Priority should be to 
                          keep the family together for commuting convenience. 
                         Students in middle or high school should not have their pyramid changed 
                         Students in same family should follow and finish in high school pyramid where they originated. 
                         Students in the new housing development spurring area growth and need for new schools should be 
                          assigned to the new school. 
                         Students in their last year at any school (6th, 8th, 12th) are allowed to remain at the previously assigned 
                          school. All others move to newly assigned schools.  
                         Students should attend the school that is closest to their home. 
                         Students should be "grandfathered in" to make sure they can complete middle school or high school at 
                          their assigned school. Rising students can be assigned a new MS or HS as boundaries change.  
                         students should be able to attend the same school once they have begun there (elementary, middle or 
                          high). But moving to a different school beginning in 7th or 9th is fine. 
                         Students should be able to choose the public school that they want to attend 
                         Students should be able to stay at current school when there is a boundary change. Boundary change should 
                          be discussed with parents and decision should be made by parents and their child.  
                         Students should be allowed to finish in their current school before moving to a newly assigned school.  
                         Students should first have the option of attending the school closest to their home distance wise as their 
                          base school, and then have the option of attending a specialized school that is further away through the 
                          lottery system/special acceptance.  
                         Students should follow new boundaries, providing that exceptions are made for kids who attend immersion 
                          or AAP classes. They should be able to continue these programs in middle and high school. Boundary 
                          changes should take this in to consideration.

                         Students should have choice to stay in their high school pyramid when changes boundary. It's only a 
                          decision the school district makes on the paper but a life change to students who are impacted. So please 
                          be considerable like your own children are impacted by your policy changes.  
                         Students should have continuity. If they start in a school/pyramid, they should be able to finish in the same 
                          school/pyramid.  
                         Students should have the choice to change school under new boundaries until they are moving from 
                          Elementary to MS and then MS to HS.  
                         Students should have the option of which middle and high school to attend that best meets their neds. 
                         Students should NOT be bused and moved to a different school because the school board wants to diversify.  
                         Students should not have to change a school they have started attending. Should be able to finish out all of 
                          elementary school at the one they are currently at, for example. 
                         Students should remain in current school despite boundary changes.....families should not have to move to 
                          remain in existing assigned schools 
                         Students who are currently enrolled should not be forced to change schools with new school boundaries. 
                          If two schools are approximately the same distance from a students home, they should have school of 
                          choice.  
                         students who are currently in HS (9 to 12) should remain in the school they are currently enrolled unless 
                          they want to move to the new boundaries 
                         Students who choose to remain in a current school after a boundary change should not expect bus service.  
                         Students who currently attend a school should be grandfathered if there are boundary changes. That should 
                          be the ONLY exception. All schools should offer the SAME curriculum to reduce transfers/requests to attend 
                          other schools. IE: Students that live in the MVHS boundary going to Hayfield. 
                         Students who have already been enrolled in a school should never be forced to change schools and disrupt 
                          their social life/wellness/consistency. 
                         Students who reside near the boundary border should attend the school with lower enrollment e.g. Langley 
                          vs McLean to balance the enrollment instead of forcing McLean to build more trailers just because the 
                          students' parents don't want their kids to switch schools. Not fair to McLean HS! 
                         survey is biased; disguised as a way to provide population relief, but is really intended to <dversify= by 
                          mixing underperforming pop with higher. This won’t work out..people that can afford it will just move away 
                          from the school this will tank home values in the area, not create a better school. 
                         Survey those parents you know will be impacted! You know who we are 
                         Take a look at the world and historical boundary creations. Much of the unrest in the world stems from 
                          authority creating boundaries without giving much thought to how it may effect the people forced to live 
                          within created boundaries. A program shouldn’t take students away from their home.  
                         take race and economics out of the equation - the decisions should be based purely on geographic and 
                          projected information 
                         Take special needs in consideration 
                         Taking kids out of their neighborhood to balance diversity runs the risk of making school particularly extra 
                          curricular activity more difficult for financially disadvantaged students. The focus should be on lifting these 
                          schools up. Not placing kids in schools farther from their home.

                          underpopulates schools that have great staff and community. Not to mention that parents work the system 
                          and allowing kids in on appeal takes away from the kids that truly qualify.  
                         The above item on "creating schools that reflect diversity".... while this is a laudable goal, I worry that this 
                          would put the burden on the diverse student to be bussed into white neighborhoods. That seems grossly 
                          unfair to me. 
                         The answer is not to just bus kids long distances b/c one school has room while their current school is over-
                          crowded. Invest in good quality schools with capacity within communities.  It's wasteful and pollutes when 
                          busing such far distances. It's also a waste of the student's time.   
                         The answer will vary if you go to a better school and will move to a lesser school or vice versa. Changing 
                          boundaries should rarely be used. FCPS should work with the county zoning to anticipate areas of growth 
                          instead of dealing with overcrowded classrooms as they occur.  
                         The best way to approach the uneven enrollment at FCPS schools is to look into the quality of instruction 
                          and culture at each school. Families leave schools and move away when they feel their children's interests 
                          are not considered. FCPS may see a massive exodus of families if poorly executed. 
                         The biggest consideration for me is to make sure there are specialized programs throughout the county, 
                          and that students from all communities attend schools. Diversity in all forms in important.  
                         The boundaries have to have some equal representation of all diversity of race, culture and economic 
                          differences. Then resources must be distributed equally to all theses schools too 
                         The boundary between FHS and Chantilly HS is not rational. We live mush closer to CHS and the commute 
                          would be against traffic, whereas FHS is farther away and the commute both ways coincides with heavy 
                          traffic in the same direction. A shorter commute is important so kids have time for homework. 
                         The boundary changes should not adversely affect property values. 
                         The boundary lines near Reston Avenue, Rt 7 (Leesburg Pike), Shaker Woods, Whiele should be looked at 
                          again. Every single surrounding neighborhood, except ours, is part of the Langley Pyramid, whereas our 
                          small pocket of homes goes to the Herndon Pyramid. It does not make any sense.  
                         The boundary of school districts becomes an issue if the new boundary change affects the family to attend 
                          lower academic standard school. The school system caters primarily to the economically disadvantaged in 
                          title 1 schools and the average student gets pushed aside and destined to fail.  
                         The boundary policy should include the option for families who are already enrolled in a school to remain 
                          in that school until their children complete all grades at that school.  
                         The boundary process should totally be done by an independent party; shift things as needed to keep the 
                          school enrollments balanced (we should not be subjecting kids to overcrowded schools when there are 
                          ones that are under-enrolled). 
                         The boundary where I live should be reevaluated - I live on Shadowlake Way in Springfield, VA, and I have 
                          to drive past Hunt Valley Elementary School which is much closer, in order to get to Orange Hunt Elementary 
                          School, which is much further and where we are assigned. Kindly take a look. Thanks!

                         The bus stop and route to it are not safe for my son. It’s located in a well known drug traffic area, there are 
                          limited sidewalks, and there are no crosswalks to aid him in walking safely to the stop, particularly on dark 
                          mornings.  
                         the bus times are insane. My daughter is a bus rider but has a double back bus. It is absolutely not fair that 
                          her bus Chantilly bus #20 is 30 mins late at dismissal every single day. They need to stop offering buses to 
                          so many kids outside of boundary to come for programs. Its not fair to students 
                         The changes apply to everyone. Stop creating segregation or elitism. All students follow the boundaries. 
                          Create the programs at all schools and ensure a balanced program across all school.  
                         The changing boundary for existing FCPS students will affect negatively both parents and students. Parents 
                          made plans when they moving into their current house that their kids will attend certain schools and kids 
                          will miss their best friends when boundary change happens. 
                         The Chantilly Pyramid is the reason we moved to our neighborhood. There are lots of options that are 
                          affordable and commutable. But this was the only neighborhood that also had good schools. 
                         The community must be actively and explicitly involved in all boundary change discussions.  
                         The commute from some parts of Fairfax to Fairfax HS is too long for students. Please consider Willow 
                          Springs ES students to have the option of Centreville HS and/or Chantilly HS.  
                         The companies that build new housing/construction/developments should bear the responsibility for the 
                          additional infrastructure costs and result in the overcrowding of schools. Or the County should NOT allow 
                          new housing developments/condo building to be built. 
                         The Corredor’s in Fairfax high school are so crowded the swans can barely walk. And perfect high school is 
                          further away from our house compared to Centerville and Chantilly high school. It just doesn’t make sense.  
                         The cost of housing is astronomical in FCPS, even in places where the high school is not very good (parts of 
                          Falls Church, for example). There should be incentives to buy houses in districts with lower rated schools to 
                          encourage younger families to buy into lower-performing school districts. 
                         The county members should not have the power to inflict harm upon students, parents and property 
                          owners. This is not a dictatorship; all residents should have the right to vote on the issues concerning their 
                          neighborhoods and those who are not affected by a change should have no say in the matter.  
                         The county must consider how boundary changes affect home values for the impacted families. 
                         The county should not change the school boundaries as many parents moved to a certain area because of 
                          the elementary, middle and high school. Making the change will put these parents in a difficult position 
                         The county system is too large to effectively meet the diverse needs of all the students. They should 
                          consider breaking the system up into smaller school districts. 
                         The county system is too large to effectively meet the diverse needs of all the students. They should 
                          consider breaking the system up into smaller school districts.   
                         The current boundaries are not reflective of a thoughtful approach to commute times and/or neigborhood 
                          assignments. Further, they are perpetuating segregation in FCPS by concentrating a certain segment of the 
                          population in underperforming schools.  
                         The current boundary policy never made sense to my family. We live in Fairfax/Merrifield very close to 
                          Oakton, Madison & Fairfax HS but our HS is Falls Church. I hope the new policy keeps families in closer 
                          proximity to their HS.

                                                                                         FAIRFAX SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIALS 
                         The current boundary policy works. Do not change it. Do not change boundaries to try to achieve some 
                          magically "correct" diversity target. Educating our children should not be a social experiment.  
                         the current school system and boundary assignments is inherently racist. Rich people congregate into 
                          certain spots and raise property prices. In the process, all development and business will go to those areas 
                          too making it impossible for middle income families to live in those neighborhoods 
                         The current schools that the children are already enrolled in should not change, the boundary changes 
                          should take effect after the children graduate from that school. The boundary change should be a phased 
                          process. 
                         The  current  state  of  FCPS  school  boundaries  requires  a  major  overhaul  based  on  the  logical  and 
                          independent review (without any neighborhood lobbies getting involved). Decision-making for boundaries 
                          should be based on objective criteria, e.g. a) travel time/student hardship, b) diversity, etc. 
                         The decision is not only about school but also about the value of people’s real estate, which might be the 
                          biggest investment in a person’s life.  
                         The disruption to the students related to shifting schools is not necessary and after a year and half without 
                          in person learning our children have enough to deal with. DO NOT CHANGE THE BOUNDRIES. 
                         The distance to base schools should be considered as a priority. There are two middle schools closer to my 
                          house than my child's assigned middle school. In addition, there are two high schools closer to my house 
                          than my child's assigned high school in terms of distance. It makes no sense. 
                         The entire AAP program should be reconceptualized. Mantua complains of overcrowding, but their school 
                          communities and families units aren't ripped apart and decimated. Level IV students should exclusively be 
                          provided services at their assigned elementary schools.  
                         The entire school board should resign in disgrace for failing this county! 
                         The fact that children from Herndon and Rest (and live five minutes from Herndon Middle and High) go to 
                          Langley is incredibly inequitable. 
                         The fact that you use race and income as the first few items tells me everything I need to know about this 
                          survey. Look at Wake Forest, NC and others that have done what you are proposing, it is a disaster. If my 
                          kids are moved out of our current pyramid we will 100% leave FCPS.  
                         The FCPS board should understand that major financial decisions are made to move into a neighborhood 
                          based on the school and proximity. I purchased my current home, and remain in this home with the specific 
                          intention of my child attending Greenbriar West, Rocky Run, and Chantilly High School.  
                         The FCPS definitions of "diversity" and "equity" should be dropped. Example- This survey asks for my race 
                          but not my student's. I'm white and she is minority. Get your focus 100% on education and 0% on other 
                          social issues. It should be fairly easy to count the # of seats compared to # of students. 
                         The FCPS system is too large and needs to be reduced in size. There are way too many schools in this district, 
                          which leads them to being managed improperly. 
                         The focus on race, income, and other non-educational factors is disappointing and counter-productive. 
                          Those factors have no place in determining school boundaries. 
                         The focus should be about allocating the appropriate resources to schools to help them be on par with 
                          other schools in the district. Re-drawing school boundary lines does not solve the on-going problem of 
                          inequity in education.

                                                                                         FAIRFAX SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIALS 
                         The friction comes from home values tied to school boundaries because of uneven qualityof schools. The 
                          responsibility of public schools is to teach ALL children well. Different communities need different styles 
                          and services. Until schools start effectively teaching children, boundaries will be a pro 
                         The growth in McLean/Tysons needs to be addressed by providing an addition to McLean or building a new 
                          High School for the Tysons students. 
                         The  Herndon/Langley  boundary  discussion  highlighted  inequality  between  schools  in  Fairfax  County. 
                          Significant investments should be made to lift all FCPS to the high levels of its best performing schools. 
                         The high school boundaries need to be reassessed. Some elementary and middle schools are being split to 
                          different high schools, which is not good for socialization. Shouldn't rezone to worse schools without option 
                          of staying in good school.  
                         The highest grades at any school should not be forced to move schools, but giving the choice.  
                         The IB program needs rethinking. Unless all HS are IB, you only attract teachers who understand AP teaching 
                          a program too complex to understand. This model only works if post high school college entry was treated 
                          the same as Dual Enrollment. Had to make switch.  
                         The issue with neighborhood schools is that sometimes they are located in moderate to low-income 
                          communities and the school has fewer resources that translate to fewer fieldstrips and assemblies, fewer 
                          grand beautification projects, fewer activities. Larger schools tend to have more PTA funding.  
                         The  Juatice  pyramid  is  so  ridiculously  overcrowded  that  I’ll  have  to  move  to  give  my  kid  a  chance. 
                          Glasgow/Justice Cannot assign lockers because of too many children. They are forced to carry bags, 
                          instruments, sports gear all over school all year long!! BUILD NEW SCHOOLS! 
                         The Justice pyramid change was nuts this year. After being told that it would not impact this school year, it 
                          did. So any changes should have more transparency and notice. It was ridiculous to register my child for 
                          kindergarten and attend orientation at one school only to end up at a diff school. 
                         The Langley border extended to accommodate the rich, white people of Great Falls is flat-out racist and 
                          embarrassing. Be better!  
                         The Langley boundary should be closely examined.  
                         The  level  of  disparity  across  various  schools  and  school  boundaries  is  very  high  in  terms  of  school 
                          populations, and the distances kids travel within a school boundary to get to school. FCPS needs to modify 
                          school boundaries to level the number of students across schools and travel times. 
                         The local FCPS school was a factor in where my family decided to live. I would be upset if my child was 
                          moved  from  this  school  due  to  boundary  changes.  Children  should  go  to  school  with  kids  in  their 
                          neighborhood and have short bus times. I would remove my child and go private if such a change occur 
                         The Marshall Boundary has a couple neighborhoods that are closer Madison Pyramid Schools. That tiny 
                          offshoot of families that live around Meadowlark is what I’m particularly talking about. My son having to 
                          one day travel 45 min by car to Marshall when Madison is only 10ish minutes away is ridiculous 
                         The maximum bus or car ride to school should be 15 mins (including stops). Boundaries should be set 
                          accordingly. 
                         The most amazing part of my children's school is that it truly is a neighborhood school and they feel like 
                          part of a community, which is so important to get them to love school at a young age. We all move here for

                                                                                         FAIRFAX SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIALS 
                         The most efficient way to create educational diversity is to provide similar diversity of programs in all school 
                          pyramids and additional support services to students who need it more (such as in Title 1 schools). Rezoning 
                          is disruptive and would not provide improvement as fast, if at all.  
                         The most important communication I believe needs to happen with realtors/housing reps. Parents need 
                          accurate info about base schools and transportation provisions. Diversity in schools must NOT mean adding 
                          on a group of homes which make just those students walk far or go to a different middle achool 
                         The most important considerations should be preserving neighborhood boundaries, avoiding split feeders, 
                          and avoiding crossing major highways. 
                         The most important is to keep the elementary school to middle school to high school the same. The kids 
                          that go to a different middle school or high school should NOT be at the same elementary school....Keep 
                          the pyramid from ES to MS to HS. 
                         The most important item would be to ensure current students have the option to remain in the current 
                          pyramid, if population changes requires boundary updates so long as they are grandfathered for current 
                          students and the necessary changes occur slowly and new residents made aware of new boundary 
                         THE MOST important reason the FCPS must make the boundaries review is to guarantee to ALL students 
                          the right education with teacher individual attention and provide the safe and appropriate place for the 
                          students to have their classes. Additional bunkers or containers should never be a solution. 
                         The myopic focus on race, income, diversity, and related factors is disappointing. Such factors have no place 
                          in determining where kids should go to school.  
                         The negative impact on property values must must must be the TOP PRIORITY when considering a boundary 
                          change. Property owners suddenly unable to refinance mortgages or take equity out of there homes for 
                          retirement is outrageous. There is measurable and meaningful economic harm with boundary changes. 
                         The number one concern I have is removing children from the current school they are attending. I went to 
                          two different elementary schools and three different high schools, and it is extremely difficult on children 
                          to undergo those transitions and move away from friends, teachers, and their school. 
                         The only reason for the long bus ride is the lack of drivers and the bus having to drop off students and go 
                          back. Current boundaries are important and should not be changed. I lose confidence in the school board 
                          when they make decisions based on emotions rather than facts 
                         The only valid reason to rezone schools is to fix drastically over crowded schools with no expansion options. 
                          The most successful schools are those built around community NOT involuntary bussing or rezoning. Copy 
                          West Springfield. Diverse, closed the achievement gap, very involved community =success 
                         The only way to make this effective is if all students adhere to the new boundary - period - we all know it 
                         The option that I would like to have seen and chosen for how often a boundary should be reviewed or 
                          changed is "rarely"  
                         The overcrowding question and question about schools with not enough students is not as simple as the 
                          questions. It all depends on factors such as population demographics, local construction, and programs at 
                          the school. My answers would be impacted by these factors. 
                         The overwhelming promotion of diversity - specially gender identification - is making schools and students 
                          deviate their focus from what schools are all about - learning skills and prepare for life in the future. 
                         The problem high school students are facing us that they are not offered schools that have both IB and AP 
                          programs. If those schools offer both programs and have SAME electives abd after school activities then 
                          students are parents would not be looking for a transfer and if rejected relocating

                                                                                         FAIRFAX SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIALS 
                         The process must be fully transparent. 
                         The quality of our local high school and the ability to walk there was a make-or-break factor in our decision 
                          to purchase our home where we did. Also forcing kids to get on a bus to go a school further than a walkable 
                          one is just wrong. 
                         The questions were too simple with no context. I would favor a boundary change if it was a simple one with 
                          one under-enrolled school next to an overenrolled one. If all schools in a large area are overenrolled, then 
                          I would favor a construction option.  
                         the ranking question was not working accurately 
                         The reason FCPS gets so much push back is because the standards are different at every school. They must 
                          work to provide similar programs and the same level of teachers regardless of the boundaries. That would 
                          help to level the playing field. 
                         The school boundaries should minimize transportation/commute times fir students 
                         The school needs to take into consideration the effect on neighborhoods. 
                         The second to last question is broken and buttons did not let me rank, but i would prioritize keeping entire 
                          neighborhoods in the same school as it fosters stronger relationships with our neighbors. I would also value 
                          creating neighborhood schools and ones that reflect the diversity of fairfax count 
                         The southern part of Fairfax County does not seem to have the same academic opportunities as the 
                          northern part of the county. Please fix the disparities. The IB and other programs should be available 
                          without a long commute. 
                         the speed at which we build additions to existing schools is pathetically long. speed up the expansion to 
                          existing schools. riddled with red tape and bureaucracy. one year just for permits! that's nuts. come on 
                          fairfax co! 
                         The student should be assigned to the school which is closer to his/her home by distance. This will reduce 
                          the students commute time to the school. The will also reduce the cost for fcps.  
                         The survey reveals a very clear and predetermined bias, that is in favor of boundary changes having lasting 
                          negative consequences, to the more affluent areas of Fairfax County. 
                         The transportation issue is paramount. Children should not be sitting on buses for long times! That time 
                          can  be  used  for  healthier  things  (playing,  connecting,  getting  help  with  schoolwork).  Fewer  buses  is 
                          environmentally sound, and addresses the bus driver shortages 
                         The unfortunate uproar regarding Herndon/Langley boundaries highlighted that FCPS schools are perceived 
                          as being widely divergent in opportunities given to students. For boundary discussions to overcome this, 
                          significant investments must be made to reduce inequality between schools. 
                         There appears to have been a disconnect in planning for school construction, and infrastructure in general, 
                          with approval of building more single family home units in the area. 
                         There are 10 thousand things which I would like to know and they cannot be given in 300 words. However, 
                          1 is, Why is a child who qualified for TJ, but did not get in, sent back to the 23rd ranked HIgh School. 
                         There are many important priorities but my biggest concern is commute time. This is a quality of life issue 
                          and it's very hard for me to think about kids being on a bus for 30 minutes or more one way. Currently, the 
                          high school kids in our neighborhood have an extra long commute.

                                                                                         FAIRFAX SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIALS 
                         There are often unintended consequences. For instance, after changing the boundary to reduce the number 
                          of students assigned to a school, there may be an influx of families to the new boundary, which can offset 
                          the effects of the change. Thus, reactions of families should be taken into account. 
                         There are students who live in Maryland and PWC who are attending our schools. The use the address of 
                          relatives and this often contributes to the overcrowding in our schools. This needs to be addressed before 
                          any boundary changes are considered.  
                         There is a specific case that needs to be reviewed for the Summerhouse Landing community on Sugarland 
                          Road. Our neighborhood is isolated from the Langley school pyramid. All neighborhoods around us are 
                          mapped to Langley and we are the only neighborhood mapped to Armstrong and Herndon in our area.  
                         There is a value in both certainty and consistency of neighborhood schools that you put at risk with 
                          boundary changes.  FCPS has done a very poor job of anticipating student enrollment the past 10 years No 
                          confidence they will suddenly get better.  open enrollment &charter schools should be option 
                         There is a wealth disparity directly affecting quality of school vs affordable housing  
                         There is an old saying <If it isn’t broke - don’t fix it. I recommend analyzing each school on a case by case 
                          basis. Neighborhood schools are ideal because less commute equals more student/parent involvement. As 
                          a parent of 4 students in the FCPS system, I emphasize consistency. 
                         There is definitely an equity issue for the school pyramids along the route one corridor. The high schools 
                          and middle schools in this area are not built to the same standards as the others throughout FCPS. The 
                          lower income area should not be oppressed like this, equitable education for all FCPS. 
                         THere needs blot be careful consideration to the makeup of a school, it shouldn’t skew all aap or esol but 
                          be a mix and keep neighborhoods together. And be transparent and actually consider parent feedback vs 
                          making changes at the 11th hour and implementing a plan that was never shared  
                         There needs to be a survey of family’s in split feeder situations. The way you are conducting this survey will 
                          skew the results in favor of those families not impacted by a split feeder boundary situation and ignore the 
                          mental health and well being of the students who are most impacted by them  
                         There should be a grandfather clause for students already attending said school. 
                         There should be a long grandfather period so that kids can stay in middle and high school with the kids from 
                          their elementary school. 
                         There should be a standard boundary process that is holistic every 5 years or so. The small boundary 
                          changes over the years have not equalized the capacity in schools. Move 5th and 6th graders to middle 
                          schools or at least 6th graders to minimize the number of years committed to a school.  
                         There should be a way to use GIS to assign children to schools to minimize travel time to their schools. 
                          Children should be assigned to the school closest to their house. 
                         There should be an exception made for students who have been in their current school for a significant 
                          time. For example, 5th and 6th graders should be granted seniority at their elementary schools and NOT 
                          forced to move.  
                         There should be better planning and coordination with city developers to forecast future needs and 
                          announce changes years in advance to minimize impact and surprises to new home owners. Also, "Create 
                          neighborhood schools" has no definition and thus multiple interpretations will impact your results 
                         There should be long term thinking and strategy around overcrowding and not only short term solutions 
                          that may cause other harm like breaking up communities and student friendships

                                                                                         FAIRFAX SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIALS 
                         There should be separate schools designed for residents of the emerging hi-rise apartments in the Tyson's 
                          Corner area as they are contributing to the overcrowding of schools built on a single-family housing.  
                         There should not be any boundary changes at all. Where you live determines what school you attend  
                         There’s a large need to build new schools in my area. It’s not the boundary that’s the issue. Changing those 
                          would be doing a disservice to students who thrive on knowing each other and growing together. I’m not 
                          happy my kids have to have a new set of kids and teacher each year. Don’t change boundry 
                         These are difficult decisions. You will not be able to make everyone happy. 
                         These are difficult questions to answer. Ultimately I feel rebalancing boundaries - with 5-10 years of growth 
                          in mind and not just a <what’s needed today’ perspective- should be done when possible rather than new 
                          construction. But there is a need to maintain quality when kids are reassigned.  
                         These kids have been through enough and still continue to struggle with the lack of planning from FCPS. DO 
                          NOT disrupt them any more than they have already suffered.  
                         These questions are difficult to answer as parents likely value different things at the different levels of 
                          schooling. For example, one may value a neighborhood school a lot more in elementary school than during 
                          high school. 
                         Think about traffic flow and distance. The chantilly high school border is so narrow. 
                         this can be a tricky proposal. Students need diversity in the schools but also need short travel time to and 
                          from and specialized programs should be available in all schools to create diversity and academic access. 
                          When possible the less moves a student makes the better. 
                         This directly affects real estate value when boundary changes are made.  
                         This Idea is ridiculous, I moved from Bolivia to the US for a better life and then from NY to VA to further my 
                          dreams of a better life. If people want better the only way they will achieve it is if they too work for it 
                         This is a complicated but necessary step to ensuring equal access and proper education for all our kids. 
                          Thank you for your actions on this. 
                         This is a hard problem but most kids are adaptable, more so than parents may give them credit for. You will 
                          need accommodations for kids with special needs that make adaptation harder--but you deal with that 
                          already. Wishing you wisdom and good luck with this challenging issue. 
                         this is a really contentious issue. Having moved into FCPS from another state where schools in general never 
                          had enough funds, even the lowest "ranked" school in FCPS is better than most of the schools in our former 
                          one. Do what's best for the students always (i.e. equity, student/teacher ratio). 
                         This is a terrible idea and a distraction as usual from the real problems facing this district. 
                         This is a terrible survey. What we need is ensure housing development match resources (roads, schools, 
                          services) available. Schools are getting crowded because constructors are doing what they please.  
                         This is a tough one, there's no "right" solution. I want my kids going to school with their neighbors, close to 
                          our neighborhood, but I also want diversity. I think focusing on close base schools, with spread out special 
                          schools, seems to offer the best balance of parent choice. 
                         This is a very difficult survey to answer because I'm unsure of the implications of certain options. I oppose 
                          moving small numbers of kids from high-performing schools to less desirable schools. Either move big 
                          numbers of kids and rebrand that lower performing school, or move no one and build out.  
                         This is absurd. Everyone bought ridiculously overpriced houses to get into good schools. Boundary changes 
                          should not be considered.

                                                                                         FAIRFAX SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIALS 
                         This is an opportunity to lean in to the One Fairfax plan for racial equity. I STRONGLY encourage boundaries 
                          to be drawn to create diversity in schools. As a Mother of a white, privileged boy, I want school boundaries 
                          to be drawn across neighborhoods so that he can experience diversity.  
                         This is long overdue! Glad to see changes coming. West Potomac is so overcrowded the quality of education 
                          is being impacted.  
                         This is ridiculous! Questions don’t make sense.  
                         This is tough and we know. We moved here and paid a MUCH higher price for this house so that our kids 
                          could attend specific schools the are walkable and highly ranked (Vienna ES-Thoreau MS-Madison). To 
                          change the boundary is unjust.  
                         This is very hard. We chose the best neighborhood we could afford in the town and we know it's not the 
                          best school. Diversity is a good thing and I'm happy the school has that. Boundary changes should seek to 
                          reduce wealth disparities between schools in the same pyramid.  
                         This is very sensitive issue. Many families have purchased homes and made long term plans based on the 
                          schools  that  are  assigned  to  specific  areas.  Any  changes  should  be  considerate  of  this  and  changing 
                          boundaries should not be a regular matter and should not negatively impact families.  
                         This should be avoided at all costs. Build new schools or implement specialized programs such as IB to 
                          incentivize change.  
                         This sounds like it’s going to be really bad. I’m now worried you’re going to change the schools my kids will 
                          be attending, and that would make me furious. 
                         This survey clearly has a goal of removing high performance Langley Pyramid students into the failed 
                          Herndon Pyramid under the guise of bus times. Why not address the violent Herndon issues head on and 
                          not sacrifice good kids into a meat grinder? 
                         This survey is not comprehensive or clear. The results should not be used to make conclusions. I hope the 
                          school board develops clear goals, timelines, communicates clearly with community. We should look to 
                          other counties to find best practices to handle overcrowding, long bus rides, etc.  
                         This survey is not super straightforward. The basics are: 1) grandfather kids in 8th grade and higher when 
                          making changes. 2) allow siblings to stay together 3) make schools equal enough in quality that a change 
                          isn't going to tank property values 4) do the work to add space before overcrowding 
                         This survey is super skewed, particularly the first several questions.  Really surprised to see the way things 
                          are written.  Very perjorative.  And the timeframes of 5-10 is too broad. Needs to be smaller segments of 
                          time.  Boundary change when my kid was in 2nd grade tore apart her school.  
                         This survey should not be used for decision-making. It solicits opinions without any information on the 
                          options such as costs and trade-offs. Decisions should be made by experts who are armed with facts. I bet 
                          you would get an entirely different set of answers if you provided more information. 
                         This survey was very biased and poorly executed. It is obvious there is an agenda towards a specific 
                          outcome.  
                         This topic can be challenging. Our family is grateful that our son was able to transfer to South Lakes HS from 
                          Herndon HS to participate in the IB program, which he is better suited for. FCPS should try to find a balance 
                          between location/proximity of home to the school and being student-centric. 
                         Thought must be given to the impact some of these boundary changes could have on property value.  
                         Thought should be given to a one size fit may not work. Individual cases may have to be reviewed and solved 
                          for the best interest of the children.

                                                                                         FAIRFAX SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIALS 
                         Thoughtful  consideration  should  take  place  to  ensure  minimal  disruption  to  the  student  experience, 
                          relationships, and learning. COVID has already placed a significant amount of trauma on children/families. 
                          No changes should take place until COVID has been addressed and learning gaps closed.  
                         Timing  of  population  growth  is  important  in  selecting  the  best  option.  For  instance  temporary  over 
                          crowding shouldn't be addressed by permanent construction.  
                         Tired of split feeders. My kids have started over in MS and HS socially when split from the majority of their 
                          elementary friends because of the way boundaries were adjusted. Ridiculous! 
                         To answer this question: "Of the following options, what should be the highest priority to address schools 
                          that are overcrowded?" one has to assume sufficient space in close by HS or Secondary school to make 
                          boundary changes work. Saving that, flex the schedule. 
                         To be fair, everyone should follow the new boundary change. Then parents can request to the boundary 
                          they wanted when there are extra spaces.  
                         To be honest I am not informed enough on how best it is to redo boundaries. All I know is our taxes on our 
                          homes is what generates the income for our schools and this is not fair. It is an unfair structural issue in our 
                          public schools 
                         To the extent that you can, it would be wonderful to continue neighborhood schools as I feel that is 
                          important for community building. As well as letting kids who start at a school finish there for continuity 
                          purposes. Thanks for all your hard work on this! 
                         Todos los lÃ-mites geogrÃ¡ficos deben tener cambios segÃºn el crecimiento de la poblaciÃ³n,mÃ¡s escuelas 
                          deben contar con todos los programas que se ofrecen en las escuelas sobre pobladas,algunas solo estÃ¡n 
                          sobre pobladas por programas preescolares. Se puede logran un balance  
                         Too many single family homes allow multiple families to reside in them causing the overflow and are a drag 
                          on additional resources.  
                         Too much change is detrimental to the kids. 
                         Top priority should be student proximity to home. It is important that children obtain high quality education 
                          right in their own community. From there, balance student/teacher ratios within neighboring schools as 
                          much as possible.  
                         Tough questions and the answers in reality will not be simple. My school experience (not FCPS) was good 
                          because I was within 1.5 miles of my school (and walked) and never had our boundaries changed. All 
                          advanced placement was available in all schools. Making kids change schools is disruptive. 
                         Trailers seem like a very limiting option. The kids find them uncomfortable - too crowded, hard to control 
                          temperature, that’d to travel between them and school. 
                         Trailers should be a temporary make work, not a long-term default plan. 
                         Transportation & proximity is the largest concern I have. Our children could be traveling well over 30 
                          minutes with no traffic to their assigned High School when there are 3 other High Schools within a mile of 
                          our house. The boundary makes no sense. South Springfield/Lorton traveling to Franconia. 
                         Transportation is a hassle for thr kids a d parent bus timing and schedule is unpredictable  
                         Transportation time is important. I love that my kids live so close to their schools. I would hate for them to 
                          move to a school farther away just to shift populations. Children should go to the closest school to their 
                          home; commute times are ridiculous and emotionally taxing for kids and adults. 
                                      Fairfax County Public Schools  December 9, 2021                            P a g e  | 141

                                                                                         FAIRFAX SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIALS 
                         Transportation time is very important and can be costly. Children should go to the school closest to their 
                          home; commute times are ridiculous and emotionally taxing for kids and adults. Neighborhood schools help 
                          build community support and allow children to make friends with kids who live nearby.  
                         Transportation time should be number 1. Keep same program availability at all schools. Cut with the 
                          immersion and gifted bs 
                         Travel times to schools are irrelevant. The county needs to invest in expanding schools structures as the 
                          community grows to accommodate the current school boundaries, rather than just thinking they are going 
                          to save a few dollars on gas for bus transportation. Kids going to high school will drive.. 
                         True equality is giving us school choice; allow charter schools in Fairfax and give minorities a chance to 
                          achieve. Government schools are not effective anymore. 
                         Try an offset cycle for all grades  
                         Try to have kids attend neighborhood schools. Reducing bus/travel time and encouraging walking/biking is 
                          better for the environment. I would rather have my kids in trailer classrooms at a local school than have a 
                          long bus ride. Our kids got into Level IV AAP but we opted for local, walkable schools. 
                         Try to keep Same city/ zip code students in the same high school. Only Adjust boundaries where it makes 
                          sense for the community and the city. Relocate existing high school to other location or offer students the 
                          flexibility to go to other under capacity school.  
                         Try to limit boundary changes 
                         Try to manage the HS overcrowded ! 
                         TWWADIism and NIMBYism are anti-productive, but changing schools is hard. Perhaps use trailers to keep 
                          current students in their schools until they graduate to next school, then group "transplanted" kids in same 
                          homerooms and teach them how to form connections with their new community quickly.  
                         Update  /construct  new  facilities  on  existing  campuses.  Each  school  should  accelerated  /  advanced 
                          education programs for all students  
                         Upgrade schools and facilities for better rankings, consider efficiencies in school bus schedules and routes, 
                          remove 'attendance islands' so that all kids as part of neighborhood can attend one school 
                         Use  trailers  add/remove  for  perceived  shortterm  growth  fluctuations  and  invest  in  infrastructure  of 
                          additions or buildings where trailers have become long term.  
                         Utmost care needs to be taken to ensure equity. Right now there are some schools overflowing with space, 
                          money, resources, new buildings, new furnishings, etc. & some schools which are neglected & struggling. 
                          Take Silverbrook Elementary vs Mount Vernon Woods! Lorton Station has 1200 kids some years! 
                         Vehemently oppose taking kids in the great falls pyramid and making them go to a school in herndon 
                          because of crowding in McLean/Tyson’s. This was discussed as a possibility pre-COVID. 
                         Very  concerned  about  property  values  decreasing  when  school  boundaries  occur,  causing  financial 
                          hardships for families who recently purchased a home in the rezoned community. 
                         Wait until 2024.  
                         Waste of time. Focus on more important stuff. How much money is this consultant and survey costing? It’s 
                          not like you ever listen to the parents anyway.  
                         We all choose housing to get the schools we prefer. We should not be forced to move our family in order 
                          to stay in the schools we have them going to currently. Neighborhood school are important for strong 
                          childhood friendships and real connection to the school and community.

                                                                                         FAIRFAX SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIALS 
                         We are 3 miles away from our elementary school and we cannot get there using neighborhood streets. We 
                          must get on Braddock Road towards 495, which makes it difficult during rush hour for both parents and 
                          busses. We are small island in our neighborhood that has to travel there, doesn't make sense. 
                         We are a military family, which means we have moved A LOT.  Our son, currently in 9th, has attended 9 
                          schools since preschool. When we do move, it is important that they live and attend schools with little 
                          interuption once settled. Also, that the boundaries include connected neighborhoods. 
                         We are a military family. The AAP program allows him to attend RRMS, which eliminates the "attendace 
                          island" of attending FMS. We are blocked from neighborhoods attending FMS by major roads. Hard to 
                          maintain/make friends. 
                         We are assigned to the 4th closest high school mileage/traffic wise. This needs to be rethought.  
                         We are at Aldrin (2miles away)which is a very good school but it is 15+ min bus ride we have another school 
                          Armstrong ES (0.6 miles) which is in a walking distance. We should have the choice to attend the school 
                          across the street.  
                         We are  closer  to  my  work  (0.3mi)  than  to  our  base  school  (2.6mi)  as  a  few  neighbors  with  rising 
                          Kindergarteners. My work school struggled with K number in the upcoming year. Those with closer options 
                          do not have the choice of a transfer based on proximity. It would eliminate a bus route in the area. 
                         We are hoping we are rezoned by the time our kids get to high school. Fairfax high school is very far away 
                          and causes us to drive through Fairfax traffic during peak travel times. Sending them on the bus would be 
                          such a long commute it would be difficult to make it to afternoon activities.  
                         we are in an attendance island. Older son attended LBSS for AAP but then would have had to transfer to 
                          Lewis in Springfield for HS where he knew no one. Stayed at LBSS due to world language. I drive 35 minutes 
                          in morning/afternoon to get him there. This needs to be addressed. 
                         We are in one of the neighborhoods where all but about 5 kids frim each grade go to one middle school 
                          and our kids go to a different school. This creates a lot of what seems like unnecessary social anxiety in a 
                          time that is already very fragile 
                         We are in  the  "westbriar  island"  boundary.  My  kindergartner  would  have  to  sit  on  a  bus  from  our 
                          neighborhood for 40 minutes to get to Westbriar (overcrowded) vs attend a school that is 5 minutes away. 
                          We are on a childcare hardship transfer but the logic for the current boundary is nonsensical. 
                         We are in the Herndon pyramid (Herndon High School is about a mile from our home). About 2 miles down 
                          Fairfax County Parkway, students are assigned to the Langley pyramid. The clustering of very wealthy 
                          families in the Langley pyramid perpetuates inequality. 
                         We are not happy with the pyramid that is allocated to our address. We have elected to participate in an 
                          Immersion program and will most likely move to private school or home school after 6th grade. We have 
                          hesitated to purchase a new house due to the constant discussion about boundary changes. 
                         We are right across from our current elementary and middle school (within walking distance) and could 
                          bike to the high school. We are delighted to live and go to school in an area that has an excellent pyramid 
                          and avoids a bus route to afford students and parents flexibility. 
                         We are very excited for the possibility that perhaps our child may end up going to Rocky Run & Chantilly 
                          High, as those are the closest middle & high school. Not Lanier & Fairfax High.  
                         We believe that any current FCPS student should be able to remain in their current school pyramid. Students 
                          who enter the FCPS system for the first time should follow whatever the current boundary areas are.

                         We bought a house based on the school my kids were going to attend changing boundaries can effect the 
                          price of our home which is our biggest investment. Boundaries shouldn’t be change  
                         We bought house paying premium price because of Woodson HS. If school gets changed then our house 
                          value will go down which we do not want. 
                         we bought our home due to the school boundary it is assigned to if you would do a change it will impact all 
                          the plans we have made. FCPS already took 1,5 years from my kid's school life and if there would be a 
                          change of schools this would be unacceptable. if happens it should be choosable  
                         We bought our house because of the School pyramid. Something to consider is to confirm the kids really 
                          live within the boundaries and not providing other addresses.  
                         We bought our house based on our school pyramid and would be very irritated to have the boundaries 
                          changed 
                         We bought our house based on the elementary school and MS/HS pyramid. Any changes to school 
                          boundaries should be done with either grandfathering current students or allowing for enough time (2-3 
                          years prior to implementation) for families to move if they choose.  
                         We bought our house due to the school pyramid and if that changes it will devastate us. One more thing 
                          Fcps is going to ruin. It’s been a eye opening experience how they have failed my child and so many other 
                          kids over the Covid issues. Here is one more thing <¦. 
                         We bought our house for the specific purpose of sending our daughter to Robinson SS. She will be in 
                          kingergarten next year. Whatever boundary change happens, we want to ensure she will be grandfathered 
                          in, and remain in the high school pyramid that we planned for. Many parents are in this situation. 
                         We bought our house specifically because of the school pyramid it is zoned to. We would be unhappy if we 
                          were moved to a new school. 
                         We bought our house to be in a specific school zone. If that changes...it will be very upsetting! 
                         We bought our house to be in the school pyramid that we are in. If it were to change we would be very 
                          upset.  
                         We bought the current house because of the school pyramid, just like most people in our neighborhood. 
                          Our home value was/is largely based on that too. 
                         We chose our current house based on affordability in a good high school pyramid. High school boundaries 
                          should not be changed.  
                         We chose our housing location based on all 3 schools and have a child in each. The only issue we have is 
                          that the HS is very far from our house and there are other closer HSs. However, the closest school is an IB 
                          school. We go to an AP school, and would prefer remaining AP. 
                         We chose the Oakton pyramid after talking  with  numerous  family  &  friends.  The  choice  came  at  a 
                          considerable personal financial expense/investment. To be moved out of that pyramid would have a 
                          negative impact on our children (ages 4-12) a negative impact on home's long term value. 
                         We currently moved considering the current school boundary. Changing the school boundary will be unfair 
                          for families like ours. We vehemently protest such changes.  
                         We do not support boundaries change.  
                         We do not wish our students to change high school and middle school.  
                         We don't agree on any boundary change.

                         We don't want the boundary to change as it will disrupt our child's education. We purchased our home 
                          because our child will attend a better school. Any changes to the current school that my child currently 
                          and/or will attend will negatively impact my child's education and my home value. 
                         We feel strongly that lottery or arbitrary systems should be avoided when determining boundaries.  
                         We feel strongly that our elementary student and her younger sister who has not yet started at the school 
                          should be grandfathered in and stay at our school. We purchased our house with the express purpose of 
                          being at this elementary school.  
                         We got out if the military and settled down so the kids could go to the same schools with their friends. 
                          Please don't make them change. 
                         We have a lot of defacto segregation in our school. "Special" programs and pupil placement have been 
                          "smoke screens" fostering this. If Fairfax County is 30% race or socioeconomic Category A but you have a 
                          high school that 60%+ Category A, you have defacto segregation. This is the public domain 
                         We have 4 children in different stages of a school pyramid, including high school. We would them all to 
                          follow the same path. 
                         We have paid premium prices for house in particular neighborhoods so our kids can go to a particular high 
                          school. Changing boundaries to change that would be unfair.  
                         We have schools that are busting at the seems. We need to think about their needs. Construction takes too 
                          long. Action has to happen in some capacity. I worry the right for boundary charges is focused on economic 
                          and racial discrimination and that’s when push back occurs. 
                         We just bought a new home so our child could attend Fairview ES. Changing boundaries is not fair to parents 
                          or students. 
                         We just moved here. At great sacrifice, we picked our house for this school. We expect our son to graduate 
                          from this school. We believe creating options for families like ours needs to be considered when making 
                          this decision.  
                         We just moved to our neighborhood and heavily weighed schools in our decision. Students have been 
                          through so much in the past 2 years, and mental health in youth is so terrible that beyond anything else, 
                          they and their families need NOTICE if there are to be boundary/school changes.  
                         We just moved to this area specifically for the schools within our boundary. To force students to change 
                          schools would completely upend our lives.  
                         We just purchased our home in August with the schools being the #1 consideration. We really would not 
                          want to be redistricted. 
                         We like many other families based our home purchase for a specific high school. It’s not convenient, but it 
                          was a family priority that FCPS should respect. We’ve paid taxes for many years based on this decision. 
                          We’re not interested in social engineering.  
                         We live a mile from Langley High School...yet you choose to send my 3 children 5 times that distance to 
                          McLean High School! Borders are absurd. Anyone who lives within walking distance of Langley High School 
                          should be attending there. Instead you just add to traffic in downtown McLean.  
                         We live approximately three miles from Chantilly High School, but roughly 9 miles from my son’s current 
                          school, Fairfax High School. Our commute in the morning via personal transportation is difficult considering 
                          it’s right in the middle of rush hour. It takes us approximately 40 minutes. It’s hard.

                                                                                         FAIRFAX SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIALS 
                         We live close to Kilmer MS, due to which we have not been provided bus transportation. We have to drive 
                          our child daily to and from school. Those who live close to schools, should be provided with an option to 
                          use school transportation as well. 
                         We live closed to Poplar Tree ES (within 0.8 mile), but our small community signed to Greenbriar West ES 
                          (1.9 mile away), this is really nonefficient, the kids need to take the bus, it is not financial saying, FCPS needs 
                          to spend more money for the bus and other things on this boundary.  
                         We live closest to Floris ES (20171). However it is not our school? It makes no sense and is very inconvenient. 
                         We live closest to South County HS yet my daughter is bused to Hayfield Secondary. We purchased this 
                          home to attend the new high school but the school boundary was changed.  
                         We live in Fairfax County bc of the system’s reputation from the 80’s. It’s not what it once was.  
                         We live in Pohick Estates, we could be to LOrton Station Elementary one way and Saratoga Elementary the 
                          next before arriving to Gunston Elementary. That is the very same for HS, we could be to South County 
                          Middle and High School before arriving to Hayfield Secondary school. 
                         We live in the 22031 zip code and are concerned with Falls Church being assigned as our high school. It is 
                          not anywhere near our neighborhood. Fairfax, Oakton, Woodson and Madison are closer and feel more 
                          part of our community.  
                         We live minutes from Rocky Run MS, Chantilly HS, and Centreville HS, yet our son is in the Fairfax HS 
                          pyramid. With traffic, that could take more than 30 minutes on the bus. We'd like to have the option to 
                          attend a closer school. 
                         We live near south county middle and high school which is five minutes away but assigned to go to hayfield 
                          which with traffic can take more than 30 minutes. This is a big hassale! When we have a school just so close 
                          by 
                         We live on Main St (next to Fair City mall in Fairfax city) across the street within walking distance from the 
                          Woodson Highschool, but the children have to ride the bus to attend Fairfax Highschool far away. Please 
                          consider changing boundaries. 
                         We live on westbrook drive and are currently zoned to Lanier Middle & Fairfax High School, each of which 
                          is > 30 minutes of commute. vs. Rocky Run & Chantilly high which is less than 10 minutes. For the well being 
                          of the kids in this community, we should be rezoned to Rocky Run & Chantilly High. 
                         We live where we live intentionally for our child to attend elementary, middle, and high school as it is 
                          currently. There is no need to change the boundary for this neighborhood. Thank you. 
                         We love across the street from kids who attend Fairfax High School (boundaries) but are assigned to 
                          Woodson HS. There are kids who live 5 miles further down the road on the same side of our street who 
                          attend FHS. Makes no sense regarding busing, resources, or neighborhood schools. 
                         We love our elementary school and don’t want to leave it, however we wish that our children would be 
                          attending the same middle and high school as their classmates. 
                         We made housing choices for a specific pyramid. Our son attends EAC at Hunt Valley and we would. Like 
                          him to continue through Irving and WSHS. 
                         We moved from Alexandria to our specific neighborhood almost exclusively for the neighborhood school. 
                          We visited the school beforehand multiple times and made our decision based on school zones. Many 
                          parents do this--nearly all of our young neighbors are here for the neighborhood school.  
                         We moved from Wake County, NC. They had a problem with population growth and did a horrible job with 
                          school boundaries. Families had children in three different schools with different school calendars.

                                                                                         FAIRFAX SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIALS 
                         We moved here & bought our house for our kids to go to a certain high school.Maybe if school quality 
                          improved in certain areas people would choose to move to those areas and boundaries wouldn't have to 
                          constantly switch.Make smaller schools districts for efficiency 
                         We moved here for a specific high school and our children as military kids have to move all the time - they 
                          should absolutely NOT be forced to change schools. 
                         We moved here specifically for our elementary school and other schools in the pyramid. We'd like to remain 
                          in this school system 
                         We moved into our home specifically for LBSS. Both of our children have IEPs and not only would our child 
                          be negatively effected by a boundary change but also our property values. My husband is retired military 
                          and we chose this location as a place to provide stability for our two children. 
                         We moved into our neighborhood specifically for the high school pyramid: excellent elementary, middle 
                          and high school. Student currently enrolled must be given the ability to stay where they are. 
                         We moved into the home we did because of the assigned school. If boundaries are changed our child should 
                          be able to complete his 8th grade year at his current school (currently in 7th). Making him change schools 
                          with only one year remaining at said school will negatively impact his learning. 
                         We moved into this house, in a very small school district for these specific Elementary, Middle, and High 
                          Schools. We would be very disappointed to be reassigned. 
                         We moved to Fairfax County from Upper NW DC so our children could grow up seeing people who looked 
                          different from them. I hope they can continue to benefit from a rich diversity of peers around them in 
                          school. 
                         We moved to FFX and specifically to our neighborhood for our school pyramid. Changes would be most 
                          unwelcome. Growth needs to be addressed by new construction not just shuffling around the kids and not 
                          really addressing the problem.  
                         We moved to our current residence to be in the Langley pyramid. Any child in the Langley pyramid, 
                          regardless of age, must be allowed to progress through the Langley pyramid through high school. Adjusting 
                          school boundaries carries significant consequences for property values. Build Tysons its own sch 
                         We need less new construction of new houses, etc. 
                         We need long-term forecasts of population to inform construction and renovation plans. It is simply 
                          unacceptable to see trailers installed on a school that was renovated in the last 5-10 years.  
                         We need smaller class sizes!!!! And more teachers. And more special programs/schools for kids with 
                          learning disabilities.  
                         We need to be able to plan and to be able to count on FCPS boundaries, within reason. Any changes should 
                          be announced 3 years in advance, at least. Kids who start in one school should be able to finish there no 
                          matter what. 
                         we need to get rid of the trailers at overcrowded elementary schools and re-assign boundaries to increase 
                          enrollment at under-enrolled schools 
                         We need to improve existing schools and add new schools to the area if more high-raise buildings are being 
                          approved by Fairfax County. We cannot keep adding students to existing schools and change the current 
                          boundaries because of it. Approvals of more residential buildings = more Schools!   
                         We need to put funds into improving the quality of education across the board and across all schools and 
                          stop funding political causes and think about children and their academics before anything else. Leave 
                          politics to politicians. Schools and school boards focus on academics, merit and performanc

                                                                                         FAIRFAX SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIALS 
                         We need to strengthen communities. ALL FCPS schools should have robust programs that meet the needs 
                          and provide opportunities to all students. Eliminate the elementary AAP centers and Level IV programs and 
                          the segregation by perceived ability. It’s harmful to all students. Teach all students as AAP 
                         We need to think about pre-kinder kids not to the ones in HS  
                         We paid extra to buy a house that is zoned for Robinson. If boundaries change, our house value decreases. 
                          FCPS should be required to reimburse the difference in house value when we sell this house if it gets zoned 
                          to a different school pyramid.  
                         We prefer stable boundary so that our kid won’t change their school. My kid can’t make friend easily, and 
                          he feels stressful when he has to get to know new friends. 
                         We purchased a home where we did in large part because of the schools our kids would be in. If we were 
                          to be moved to a school that doesn’t perform as well as where we currently are, we would likely move, and 
                          likely move to A different county. We do not want to be moved from our school pyramid.  
                         We purchased a home, which was older and more expensive, to attend a specific neighborhood school. 
                         We purchased a property with boundary concerns and made other sacrifices and conscious choices to make 
                          it work to live within a boundary so our children can go to certain school pyramids. Wish FCPS be mindful 
                          and we still have to deal with increased traffic and illegal parking in neighborhood. 
                         We purchased our home because it is in a strong ES/MS/HS area and would strongly oppose being 
                          reassigned. Our son is in ES and we plan to stay here until he graduates from HS.  
                         We purchased our home one year ago and made the decision based on the comfort level we had with the 
                          schools we were assigned. Moving boundaries at this point could potentially erase all the reasons we 
                          purchased our home in the first place.  
                         We purchased our home so the kids would attend Woodson - please don't change the boundary. 
                         We read the current 8130 policy and find it flexible and covers all basis as every situation is unique. It is not 
                          clear in the meetings why you want to change it or what is wrong with the current policy? 
                         We relocated to the area in 2019 and in our research, we prioritized the best school in the area to support 
                          and challenge our children in their educational needs and paid the hefty 7-fig price tag. Kids love the 
                          schools/friends that they’ve made, rezoning has been stressful and unsettling to them. 
                         We selected to move to our home 20 years ago because of the school pyramid. Changing a boundary could 
                          have financial impacts on homes and I think that should be taken into consideration.  
                         We should do all we can to make sure every school in FCPS has the same high standards, even if it means 
                          additional resources are sent to the less privileged areas, so that the whole county has desirable schools. 
                          That way, redrawing boundary lines will be less controversial and more fair. 
                         We should ensure equitable quality of the FCPS schools. Our schools have deterioriated in ratings which is 
                          due  to  demographic  changes.  Boundary  considerations  should  ensure  demographic  /  socioeconomic 
                          distribution is equitable in all schools. 
                         we should focus on including diversity locally, not transporting across long distances; keep a neighborhood 
                          together, but group neighborhoods as needed to balance school populations and diversity; keep in mind 
                          future population growth trends; do not exempt affluent areas from boundary changes 
                         We should keep the school boundary as is and start working on the next generation school environment 
                          the includes online learning to close the learning gab and resolve the school crowding. This process is 
                          divisive.

                                                                                         FAIRFAX SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIALS 
                         We should reconsider boundary changes that require bussing in kids to schools that are 20-30 mins or more 
                          outside their neighborhoods (unless it’s an AAP situation or some other advanced placement). They lose 
                          the opportunity to be involved in their local community and active in their school.  
                         We specifically bought a house in a certain pyramid and would NOT want to see changes. 
                         We specifically chose our home because of the schools we are zoned for. Now our children have made 
                          friends and have a wonderful neighborhood bond with those who attend our school. Please don't force 
                          existing students to change schools; let them remain in their high school pyramid all the way through 
                         We specifically chose our home to be in the Robinson pyramid. Many many other families in the county 
                          likewise selected a specific pyramid in which to purchase. FCPS should minimize pyramid changes. If any 
                          absolutely must be made, FCPS should maximize ability of those enrolled to remain in pyramid  
                         We specifically chose this home due to the high school pyramid, even though our child is only in elementary 
                          school. Considering the high premium we paid for our home this past year, we would be very upset if the 
                          boundary changed. If it must change allow options and school rank should be the same! 
                         We specifically moved to Fairfax County, specifically moving to the neighborhood we chose so that our 
                          children would be in the pyramid they are in. I will be beyond infuriating if our children are moved out of 
                          the pyramid that we paid a tremendous amount of money to be in. Outrage will occur! 
                         We specifically moved to this neighborhood for the public schoos (Woodson Triangle). If the boundaries 
                          were moved to exclude us, we'd look to move or into private school, which would be terribly disappointing. 
                         We specifically purchased a home for the high school pyramid and home prices were elevated because of 
                          that. If we were rezoned, I would likely consider private school. I believe schools in this area will continue 
                          to grow. Another option is to reopen/renovate Sprague Center as an elementary school. 
                         We spent a great deal of money and inconvenience moving our entire family from outside of Virginia to 
                          purchase a home in a very specific school boundary in Fairfax County and would be pretty upset if our 
                          current and future children were forced out of that school. 
                         We still mourn the loss of Clifton ES, a smaller, neighborhood-based school. In my perfect world, there 
                          would be more and smaller schools especially at the elementary level. The larger high schools often offer 
                          exceptional opportunities, but the cost is a loss of community 
                         We strongly oppose to changing boundaries in Great Falls and McLean. 
                         We travel 8 miles to get to high school/40 minutes by bus. All boundary changes have been done to 
                          "diversify" the population without regard to the impact on the time and resources that are spent to get 
                          students to and from school. Stop this.  
                         We walk because we are <too close= to the school but it takes us 20 minutes to get there. So walking is not 
                          <easy= as the survey says especially when the parent(s) work. Now I’m taking out over 2 hours of the 
                          workday walking/waiting. Please extend bus routes to close neighborhoods.  
                         We want our child to go to West Springfield High School. I moved here because the pyramid was set with 
                          WSHS as his high school. Please don't change our boundaries. We can't afford to live closer to the school! 
                         We were pushed out of a good school bc we could not afford a house in that cluster. We had to move west 
                          to find a good hs w rating 6 to find affordable housing. Kids miss their friends. why should lower income 
                          and single parent family be pushed out bc we can’t live in area we attended elem to high. 
                         We would like our students that live in the Oak hill area to be relocated to a better High school boundary 
                          we pay high taxes for our children to attend a better rates FCPS

                         We would like to optionally go to a different nearby pyramid that has capacity. We are in the McLean 
                          pyramid (overcrowded) and would like the opportunity to transfer to Langley (high capacity) that is only a 
                          couple of miles away. 
                         We would prefer that boundaries not be changed. We moved to this area specifically for the schools and 
                          do not want to see the schools changed now that we have purchased a house. 
                         We would prefer to keep the boundaries the same. It disrupts the children’s learning and makes parents 
                          anxious  whenever  there  is  a  discussion  about  boundary  changes.  Many  of  us  moved  to  certain 
                          neighborhoods because of the schools. FCPS has a lot of money - just put in additions. 
                         Well, lots of efforts and planning has been put in place by parents (academics, diversity, AAP, home 
                          purchase <¦.etc) in choosing a school that is best for their kid. My preference would be to create programs 
                          and spaces for kids on their current boundary instead of changing the boundary. 
                         West Potomac High School is overcrowded and is being renovated/enlarged while empty seats sit at Mount 
                          Vernon HS. Change boundaries at WPHS to send students to MVHS. Move Whitman MS back into the 
                          neighborhood (not 100% bused.)  
                         what is not referenced here, nor was it referenced on the calls that you held, is the challenges the current 
                          students have faced due to COVID-19. I kindly request that you remember that our students have missed 
                          18 months of in-school instruction with students and teachers whom they know and trust. 
                         Whatever the boundaries, it should make it easier for kids going to schools. 
                         When boundary change happen let it expand rather than shrink and give the parents/students the freedom 
                          of their school choice regardless of residence address "Reasonable distance from both high schools" as long 
                          as buses can be provided to either boundary (Boundary cross over) not building new school 
                         When boundary line adjustment inevitable; currently enrolled students and their future student siblings 
                          should have option to either stay or move to newly assigned school. Proposed new assigned school must 
                          have compatible ratings and quality. Let's face it not every school has the same quality. 
                         When changing boundaries you need to ensure that if a change is needed the new school is equivalent to 
                          the old school.  I think homeowners should have a choice to continue at the old school as long as they own 
                          the house. 
                         When choosing a place to live based on school choice, these changes make it difficult for military and 
                          prospective new homebuyers. I.e..We do not even look it houses outside of our selected school boundaries. 
                          As military we are often forced to drive our kids to get a safe, healthy school. 
                         When considering expanding school capacity via temporary classrooms or construction, 5 to 10 year 
                          population forecasting needs to be considered. The year after Clermont Elementary had construction 
                          completed, the school did not have enough classrooms. 
                         When constructing additional classroom space onto a school, be sure to add another cafeteria and another 
                          gym. This way students can have longer lunches at a normal lunch time and not at 10:30 am or 1:30 pm. 
                         When FCPS closed Clifton Elementary, it completely split up the community by distributing Clifton student 
                          to several different schools. It should be a very high priority to always keep communities together, even if 
                          it is more expensive than other options. The loss of that community was/is terrible.  
                         When Fort Hunt HS was changed to a middle school, West Potomac became WAY too overcrowded. The 
                          boundaries for West Po need to be changed immediately to drastically reduce the number of students 
                          attending it. Also, there should be few,if any, exceptions to not follow the boundaries.

                          to account for the long term expected increase in enrollment for that school pyramid.  
                         When i moved from Fl, i selected where we would reside based on the schooling system. That was my main 
                          priority. I'm sure there are other parents who did the same. I didnt see any option for free school choice. 
                          You are zoned to select the school but you will have to provide the transportation. 
                         When I tried to take this survey on my phone it didn't work. The 'ranking' question, with it's drag/drop 
                          answers, wouldn't allow me to move past it. I'm afraid your survey may have less respondents than it should 
                          due to this technical problem. I came to my laptop to do the survey. 
                         When I was looking to buy a home, I only looked within the school boundary of my daughter's elementary 
                          school. It was very important to me that she did not have to switch schools so I would be upset if the 
                          boundary changed. If a boundary has to change, it should only affect incoming new students. 
                         When kids are zoned to go to a high school that is part of these attendance islands, it is often extremely 
                          difficult  emotionally when you have gone to school for K-8 with students who then attend a diff HS. 
                          Emotionally and socially it can be extremely isolating and is not best for these kids.  
                         When people buy houses the first and most important aspect is base schools in Fairfax. If you decide to 
                          change boundaries, you should be doing it for new arrivals only not to distort past plans of people who 
                          already live there. Any change in boundaries will inevitably distort the housing market.  
                         When people move to areas in Fairfax county it is with the schools in mind. I think it is in important to avoid 
                          changing and re-bordering too often 
                         When possible siblings should be kept in the same school. 
                         When schools feed into multiple "next level" schools (MS, HS), students on specific IEPs should have the 
                          opportunity to attend either one of the school, for social and emotional support. Breaking the social ties in 
                          MS and HS leaves more fragile kids vulnerable in the larger environments. FAPE. 
                         When we bought our house in 2012, we moved from Alexandria, VA to Vienna for better schools. The main 
                          reason we moved to Vienna was for the schools. We bought our house specifically so our two kids could 
                          attend Louise Archer ES.  
                         When we buy the house, we already consider all the factors good or bad about the school, we just buy the 
                          house for the current public school, change boundary to move us out is not fair. 
                         When we buy/rent a house with kids we ALWAYS consider the current boundaries. I moved once from 
                          Arlington to Vienna once due this change there and would like to avoid the same again.  
                         When you measure in miles from my home, south county HS and Lake Braddock SS are closer to us. However 
                          our base school is Robinson. The kids that live across the street go to Lake Braddock as we are the last street 
                          before the boundary. I don’t know why we don’t go to the geographical closer school. 
                         Where possible, allow families to stay with same middle/high schools if older child already attends. 
                         Where potential changes could be made to address over and under population of students, be transparent 
                          about what neighborhoods/schools may be impacted and survey that population regarding options. This 
                          will enable the affected communities to have a voice.  
                         Where’s  the  question  about  who  should  implement  the  changes?  I  understand  that  was  <the  most 
                          important question= discussed last night but you’re not even asking it?  
                         While I dont think diversity should be a driving factor, I do think it should be considered. So while I think 
                          the boundaries should be balanced. I worry for those neighborhoods on the edge. They shouldnt be 
                          consistently switched. Ideally a neighborhood wouldn't be moved more than once every 20 yr

                         While I ranked 'ensure specialized programs are in all regions' low on the priority list, I feel like this is 
                          important and can be accomplished by, if necessary, moving programs (like language immersion, AAP 
                          centers) to different schools (and shuffling critical staffing with the program if necessary 
                         While we completely understand overcrowding issues - many parents purchase their homes in specific 
                          boundaries and pyramids. This can sometimes be a financial hardship for a family who is investing in their 
                          child's education - so any changes should be communicated years in advance.  
                         Why are inside the beltway schools heavily minority attended and greater than 50% free and reduced 
                          lunch? White flight to outside the beltway schools and pupil placement allows the best and brightest (per 
                          test scores) to leave their low $ minority heavy inside the beltway schools... Death Spiral. 
                         Why are race questions part of a school boundary survey? 
                         Why are you focused on sending kids away from their families and friends just to focus equity. Do you think 
                          these families who are challenged have the extra resources to ship their kids to other schools. I think 
                          creating great schools everywhere in the us should be the goal w schools partnering oth 
                         Why bus low income teens halfway across FFX C vs building new schools in their area to fix the crowds? It's 
                          always new schools for new houses. Low income could walk to school, be w/ family & community more, 
                          more able to participate in school stuff, provide more jobs for the community,  
                         Why don't we get rid of boundaries entirely and create a voucher system that allows for school choice for 
                          all.  
                         Why is this even being discussed when you have schools who don’t have/follow basic Covid protocol? There 
                          are too many controversial issues that are making FCPS divisive. Table this. 
                         Willy there be a chance of kids going back virtually? 
                         With all of the challenges we are facing, Forced masks, Forced Vaccinations, Forced medical testing, this 
                          should not even be on the agenda. Keep kids in their communities, keep parents from plummeting real 
                          estate values. FCPS will never be the same. My 3rd child is a senior. I am ashamed of FCPS. 
                         With COVID it’s essential that we don’t increase the emotional burden on these kids. Wait a couple of years 
                          to make any drastic changes 
                         With the exceeding number of new homes build in the area, building new schools to accommodate the 
                          demand is the correct and long term way. Adding trailers or expanding schools makes the already crowded 
                          schools more crowded. Changing boundary lines is necessary with the increased housing.  
                         Without knowing the specifics of the boundaries you are trying to adjust or change it’s difficult to give an 
                          informed opinion. I bought a house near a <good= school on purpose. I want my child to attend that school.  
                         Wolftrap ES students should group with the logical middle and high school (e.g. Thoreau and Madison). 
                          Currently they are being grouped with kids in middle school who they will not move onto high school with, 
                          which is disruptive to relationships. 
                         Work with County Development to understand influx in new construction, high rises, etc that will impact 
                          potential growth in an area. This should be part of the counties growth plan is to work with schools and 
                          some sort of builder tax should be applied in order to help with the funding of new school 
                         Would not want my child to be forced to change schools in the middle of their time in elem/mid/high school 
                          - it is disorienting and disruptive. Made sacrifices to purchase house BASED on the school pyramid, and 
                          proximity to them. 
                         Yes, don’t change my school boundary we live inside of Fox Mill just for this school

                                                                                         FAIRFAX SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIALS 
                         yo piezo que por el momento esta todo bien que dios les vendiga siempre 
                         You claim to be transparent, but you are not sharing which schools are targeted for boundary changes due 
                          to overcrowding. 
                         You definitely will need to build more schools to address the ever growing Tysons area. You also need to 
                          care more about both ethnic and economic diversity at places like Langley. McLean High school have been 
                          renovated and expanded long ago. Adding quads and trailers is not sufficient or equitable. 
                         You guys need to reconfigure all the schools so that they are equal. Why are some middle schools 7-8 while 
                          some are 6-8? Why do some schools have an IB program and not AP? Why are LBSS and Woodson such 
                          great schools and Lee sucks? Because you aren't funding them equally, which is racist and evil. 
                         You have never in the past considered the input from parents. You completely ignored our neighborhoods 
                          issues with how ridiculous we are zoned. 
                         You have poor high schools (schools of color) and rich high schools (white schools) ALL the kids know this 
                          This should be your number one priority. Bring all the school more to the middle.  
                         You must get community input on any proposed changes, not just family input - it impacts everyone within 
                          a school boundary whether or not they have children enrolled. The full implications of moving students and 
                          if the incoming school is properly equipped to provide them comparable quality education 
                         You need to be more proactive when analyzing boundary changes. McLean HS has been overcrowded for 
                          years and it was clear this would be the case years earlier.Something should have been done much 
                          sooner.My kids shouldn't have to take turns having a desk in the class or turn sideways to move in a room 
                         You need to plan years in advance and make those changes known because people buy property based on 
                          schools. 
                         You offered a choice, several questions back, about eliminating AAP as a means of decreasing crowding. 
                          That is a false choice; where is the choice to INCREASE those services?  Why is that not an option? Thrash 
                          for assigned schools should be minimized to the max extent possible.  
                         You should consider keeping all of the Clifton kids in one particular school. My daughter goes to Union Mill 
                          and will be attending Robinson (boundary) she will know close to no one. Coming from 6th grade to a new 
                          school with BOTH middle and high school students. That can be terrifying for a kid  
                         You should have NEVER closed Fort Hunt High School or Hollin Hall Elementary. Poor planning! This survey 
                          should  have  fillable  answer  boxes  for  all  questions!  Re-open  a  high  school  serving  the  Fort  Hunt 
                          neighborhood. 
                         Your question about the length of the students' commute was insufficient, seemingly purposefully so since 
                          it specified that it was looking for the length of the drive *not* via the school bus. Our drive is fairly short, 
                          14 minutes, but the bus ride can be nearly 45 minutes, pre-driver-shortage 
                         Your survey is biased because all the answers you want are the first choice. Bad design and transparently 
                          obvious.  
                         Zoned for Mclean HS (over crowded) -though we are walking distance to Langley (Clearview Manor). 
                          Doesn’t make sense. Need to adjust boundaries based un proximity. But let’s be honest - school board isn’t 
                          going to change anything. Using you all as someone to blame. I hope you all do the right thing.

                         The discussions leading to potential changes should be held in open hearings and should be undertaken to 
                          solve enrollment imbalances. Social engineering, <diversity=, and nonsensical OneDairfax agendas must

                         Give affected families a choice and grandfathering provision, but maybe not the extent of a 1st grader can 
                          retain their "old school" all the way through graduation, etc. 
                         Don’t change the boundaries  
                         make changes at K, 7th or 9th grade  
                         Do not change school boundaries.  Keep students where they are. 
                         Waiting period of 5 years 
                         Never change boumdaries 
                         lease buildings rather than build to allow agile response in accomodating school demand 
                         Boundaries should not change  
                         make the move optional for high school students already at their school 
                         Question is poorly worded.  Meaning? 
                         families should be grandfathered in to the school currently attending if they are the subject of a boundary 
                          change 
                         There should be some consideration given to how boundary changes could impact home values, and 
                          strategies to mitigate negative impacts on home owners.  
                         Siblings of currently enrolled students (which remain in their pyramids) can enroll in same pyramid. 
                         once in high school, should not have to change schools 
                         No change should be done to the school boundary  
                         Need to give years worth of notice; people buy houses depending on school assignments 
                         Boundary changes should not include any student who has been part of a change within the last 3-4 years 
                          (or a certain period of time) 
                         Do not chane boundaries 
                         bus driver shortage hopefully will be resolved and I'm not sure like that is something I would have to 
                          seriously think about and I just do on a quick survey there's a lot of factors that probably going to 
                          changing boundaries and like having kids graduate with their own class and if they're a junior in high 
                          school or having the new class come in as freshman or new kindergartners.. 
                         Keep siblings together if a rising student (to middle or high school) would attend a separate school from a 
                          sibling. 
                         Build new schools  
                         Allow parents who live in the boundaries to vote on proposals. 
                         Students can attend current school, but in transition years, go to the school with boundary change.   
                         Never 
                         keep the community together 
                         No boundary change  
                         The school board should require education funds from developers to pay for schools that are required as 
                          a result of large residential construction.  See Tyson's corner for details.  There should be a high school for 
                          such a highly dense area.  Lack of planning and requiring such funds from developers create these 
                          problems and communities suffer as a result.  Stop making students pay for the school boards lack of 
                          insight and planning.  Keep communities together and do your jobs! 
                         Should be limited to population growth related issues 
                         Allow for both current students and up and coming children (<grade school) to choose existing school or 
                          new structure if changed

                         No Change Needed 
                         past boundary changes should not include any NEIGHBORHOOD that has been a part of a change in the 
                          past 
                         Boundary change should not occur. 
                         All a 5 year option period for families with young children that purchase real estate to align with a 
                          particular school. 
                         Students could have a grace period of one year and then move to their new school. 
                         No boundary change - based on property NOT students 
                         No boundary changed 
                         You should go to the HS in your town 
                         Siblings not currently enrolled in FCPS should be permitted to attend schools in the original school 
                          pyramid. For example - my older brother went to Canteburry Woods, Frost and then Woodson, so I should 
                          be able to attend this pyramid as well. Families should have to transport their children to the original 
                          schools without use of FCPS buses.    
                         middle school goes to current high school but change boundary for elementary 
                         Travel and bus time should be minimized for all students 
                         boundary change should not occur. 
                 Please share any additional thoughts on the future boundary 
                 policy in the space provided below. (300 character maximum) 
                         1. There should be a <grandfather= type rule for siblings to have a choice to be allowed to stay together in 
                          the same high school pyramid, even if their school boundary changes. 2. Schools that have severe/large 
                          under or over capacities should be prioritized for boundary changes. 
                         A boundary change should always be considered prior to a school addition or trailers 
                         AAP students should attend their base schools. This would help with transportation and overcrowding 
                          issues. 
                         Address economic segregation in our community comprehensively (via housing policy reform). Don't only 
                          address it within the school system (via gerrymandered school boundaries and longer transit times). The 
                          former takes longer to achieve but is more sustainable with greater net community benefit. 
                         Adjusting boundaries based on diversity makes no sense. Changes based solely or primarily on diversity 
                          harm all students. 
                         Aim for equity in access to quality instruction and opportunity.  
                         Almost 20 years ago FCPS CIP's had contiguous groupings in spreadsheet format.  For example there would 
                          be lists of high schools with contiguous boundaries, enrollment, projections, and program-design capacity.  
                          Too obvious so it got scrapped.   
                         Always include choice in your planning as all tax payers are funding you and your actions, not just parents 
                          in failing areas.   Focus dollars first on improving failing schools and advertise your successes as schools 
                          improve. Don’t destroy your thriving, best schools with boundary disruptions.  
                         Announce changes at least 1 year before they will go into effect -- so people thinking of moving will know 
                          what school pyramid they will be in. As above, make students change together at certain natural breaks 
                          such as between elementary school and middle school, or middle school and high school.

                         any boundary changes should not bow to new construction; students must be allowed to finish; home 
                          values can be greatly impacted so grandfathering should also be considered 
                         Are we making developers adequately pony up for infrastructure demands they create? Has the concept of 
                          dense development contributed to school overcrowding?   
                         As  a  Hispanic  this  boundary  arrangements  that  FCPS  is  trying  to  make  seems  totally  racist  keep  the 
                          boundaries the way they are! 
                         As an FCPS parent/teacher for 16 years, boundaries & enrollment are fluid.  Students should never be bused 
                          or moved to balance socioeconomic.  For example, Newington forest is 1 Mile from South County, if that.  
                          Students should go to the school closest to their home & not travel farther to balance. 
                         Balancing school size, reducing the need for so many busses and having equitable access to programs is the 
                          need to for FCPS schools and students.   
                         based on geography and population, NOT social engineering or "equity" 
                         Be more lax and forgiving when it comes to grandfathering; let students/families stay in the same pyramid 
                          throughout their middle school and high school years. 
                         Be transparent. You don't have the trust of the community. Some of your own staff tell us what you're really 
                          planning. Very disappointing.  
                         Biggest concern I have heard around attendance issues caused by program offerings. If a program cannot 
                          be offered at all schools, they it shouldn't be offered. It creates an inequity and pulls children from their 
                          neighborhood schools.  
                         Boundary changes also need to factor in the economic impact to the neighborhoods where the change is 
                          being forced.  
                         Boundary changes BEFORE permanent additions are made - see Mt. Vernon and West Potomac as an 
                          example of what not to do. Students should have been moved to Mt. Vernon BEFORE an addition was made 
                          to West Potomac. Simple really. 
                         Boundary  changes  that  would  take  children  out  of  High  performing  schools  should  not  be  allowed. 
                          Expensive (too expensive) homes were purchased based on school boundary. 
                         Boundary policies need to be made in the best interest of the staff. Unfortunately in this county the interest 
                          of the parents is put above teachers. It is unfair that some schools are overcrowded and other schools are 
                          below capacity.  
                         BoundRy should permit maximum number of student to walk to school. Fees for parking at a high school 
                          should be drastically increased. Been noticing bus drivers going at speeds in excess of speed limits. 
                         changing a schools boundaries should only be as a last resort!  It should be placed on the ballet and voted 
                          on by those who would be affected.  If it fails to pass no boundaries can be changed.   
                         Children in neighborhoods should go to the same schools and elementary school children should stay in the 
                          same school all the way through 
                         Children should go to the schools within their town and/or within the current school pyramid.  
                         Communities should go to their community school. No busing. Look at what happened to counties that did 
                          this! Charlotte, etc. One Fairfax is racism disguised as <equity=.  
                         Consider families who have multiple students in two different schools (impact on scheduling, attendance, 
                          etc.) *Use projected enrollment when planning for renovation. As renovations are complete, schools often 
                          have inadequate space. Can reno plans include add'l space to be used at a future date?

                         Coordinate  with  other  components  of  the  county  government  &  real  estate  sales/development 
                          organizations to better predict demographics that determine school size 
                         County wide adjustments should be assessed/made after 10 year census data has drawn magisterial 
                          districts. Have school districts remain within magisterial boundaries as often as possible. 5 years before 
                          census redraw, SB/comm.should id most severe growth &decline enrollment areas.ad 2 atlarge seats 
                         Covid has caused so many changes for our families. Boundary changes are another challenge we don’t need 
                          right now. Please do not change our boundaries. We rely on our local school and the teachers and staff are 
                          like family to many of us who live far from home. 
                         Create specialized schools for children who recently migrated to the US.  FCPS is dumping children into 
                          schools  before  they  can  climate  to  a  new  country.    Create  transition  schools  so  children  can  enter 
                          neighborhood schools more seamlessly. Instead the school board spends $ on failing schools 4 equi 
                         Current neighborhood biases should be avoided for decision-making. I am forced to commute 1+ hour to 
                          my assigned school, while I have another school at a walkable distance (students in that school have the 
                          same complaint with the commute). What kind of biased policy goes into deciding boundaries? 
                         Do not change any boundaries! 
                         Do not change boundaries for any reason.  Your survey is titled toward getting a predetermined outcome 
                          and is unacceptable. 
                         Do not change Langley Pyramid boundaries at all. We do NOT support it. 
                         Do not mess with settled expectations.   
                         Do not rezone Waynewood Elementary.  It will cause an absolute uproar. 
                         Do not use boundary change to balance socioeconomic composition of the school.  Lease the school facility 
                          rather than build/own...this will allow FCPS to quickly and efficiently balance supply/demand.  We invested 
                          in our home and participated in our school relying on not having it taken from us!!! 
                         Do not use racial compositions of the community to impact boundaries. That is racist, short-sighted, and 
                          assumes that certain races need changes to succeed, which is not true. 
                         Don’t change boundaries.  I choose my home based upon the school pyramid.   
                         Don’t change boundaries.  People made financial decisions based on property values that are connected to 
                          the current school boundaries.  Government should not be creating economic winners and losers through 
                          arbitrary decisions that affect families. 
                         Don’t manipulate society to improve failing schools.  Solve the problem.  Be honest.  Redistrcting is just 
                          hiding the problem.   
                         don't value argument by homeowners that say can't change boundary due to home value dropping. the 
                          extra money used to provide transport from housing that is within a couple miles of Herndon HS but attend 
                          Langley HS is a waste.  that money could go to teacher raises, step increases, etc. 
                         Elementary students should attend a school close to where they live.  
                         Equity is a high priority for FCPS so please ensure equity is in the process of boundary changes - regardless 
                          of local income or 'status' areas of Fairfax County (ie. McLean, Tysons, etc)  Thank you for including FCPS 
                          staff in this survey process. 
                         Equity is needed to ensure that white flight does not continue. Stop resourcing per student and resource 
                          per needs at a school. Find methods to democratize programs. No more "rich" and "poor" schools.

                          closest or neighborhood school that minimize commuting, bus and travel time.  Students in last 2 years of 
                          a school should not be forced to move. 
                         Everyone wants to have the best education for their kids. People move/rent/buy (house) to get into the 
                          better schools. We put a lot in this decision. Invest in teachers & programs, invest in the community. People 
                          will always move to be in best school, overcrowding issue will always coming back. 
                         Excellent schools and AP programs should be available in ALL neighborhoods. Efforts should be made by 
                          the School Board to create neighborhood schools that offer the full range of benefits across neighborhoods. 
                          Busing to accomplish diversity causes resentment and degrades education for all students.  
                         Families have made housing purchases based on preferred school district, often years before children are 
                          of age for that school. Boundaries should change as little as possible and always allow a 3-5 year grace 
                          period to be grandfathered in to old boundaries. 
                         FCPS Board needs to engage ALL tax-paying citizens, not just students/families. Many families don’t pay 
                          taxes and as such shouldn’t be given an opportunity to benefit at the expense of those who do pay taxes. 
                          Many families but houses to align with existing boundaries.  Changes impact house values. 
                         FCPS needs to focus on education. If there is a certain school/grade/group that is not performing well, FCPS 
                          needs to provide better education. If students/schools aren’t doing well, it’s FCPS responsibility to do 
                          better. Boundaries don’t change the fact if FCPS is not doing a good job for a group. 
                         FCPS school boundaries need review - a quick analysis of maps will make it clear that it's time to redraw 
                          most of the boundary maps to meet student needs. I get headaches while sitting on the bus for such a long 
                          time (sometimes I want to avoid going to school). 
                         For 1-10 ?s have 10 answers. Poll is slanted & bent on boundary change.  Need to include taxpayers in 
                          discussion, not students. Why isn’t public dialogue transparent?  School boundaries are based on properties 
                          not social diversity experiments. Ensure TJ & AAP are based on IQ and not skin color.  
                         For pyramid changes, offer a choice for a period of time (perhaps six years).  In general, move towards a) 
                          supporting family choice, and b) giving large amounts of lead time to allow real estate prices a gentle 
                          response. 
                         Forcing movement of neighborhoods into pyramids with obvious academic problems is unacceptable.  FCPS 
                          administrators will need to solve these problems, not put them on my child. 
                         Future  home  construction  in  the  area  should  be  considered.  Also,  when  schools  are  renovated  add 
                          additional classroom space. 
                         Get rid of special programs that create overcrowding.  If boundary changes occur, let students have the 
                          choice of finishing in their current pyramid. Boundaries decisions should NEVER be made to satisfying 
                          racial/demographic goals set by FCPS. 
                         Give notice of change asap so families have the option to move into a different boundary location 
                         Grandfather families so as not to separate siblings. Ha ing children at different schools with different start 
                          and stop times is hard on working families.  
                         Hard-working families able to live in boundaries of certain pyramids with the anticipation of sending their 
                          children to those schools should not be penalized by redistricting. This can have adverse effects on those 
                          families and everything they have worked for. 
                         Having gone through a particularly nasty boundary change in the past I would try to avoid a boundary 
                          change at all costs. I would use boundary change as an absolute last resort.

                                                                                         FAIRFAX SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIALS 
                         Having to move to a different middle/high school than my best friends, friends i had from 1st grade, was 
                          very very difficult.  Kids should be able to choose if a boundary change is made. It is a terrible idea to move 
                          kids around.   
                         Home in Briarwood Trace is closer to other high schools (Oakton 6 minute drive, Fairfax is 8 minute drive) 
                          but assigned high school Falls Church is almost 20 minute drive.   
                         Home real estate value (and thus county tax revenue) are closely linked to assigned schools.  Changing 
                          boundaries of neighborhoods assigned to high performing schools to lower performing schools would 
                          drastically impact resident's property value as well as tax base. Please consider this. 
                         Housing location and minimizing travel time should be the one and only consideration.  Equity and balancing 
                          income and race should never be a consideration. 
                         I  worked in an under served Boston community when I observed disastrous results when school boundaries 
                          changed.  Students were traumatized leaving  family and social supports behind, long bus rides, and trauma 
                          adjusting to a new milieu.  Master teachers and relevant curriculum will better serve us  
                         I am highly opposed to changing school boundaries solely to satisfy greedy homeowners who want to be in 
                          a "better" school district and therefore increase the value of their home.  I live in one such community and 
                          those people who want to change are thinking of only themselves, not the students. 
                         I  am sad that we still have families who don’t want their children attending school with <those kids.=•  
                          Racism and bigotry are, sadly, alive and well in FCPS.  
                         I can't believe you're focused on changing the boundary policy when you can't even manage the endless 
                          quarantines, learning deficiencies from last year's remote learning, and keeping the schools open for 2022. 
                          Shame on you!  
                         I don't know why this question is worded this way: Why will your student not attend your base school? That 
                          implies present-tense and is badly-worded. My child attended their base school, we were fine with that. 
                         I grew up in a public school district that used  bussing to create schools that were more balanced in terms 
                          of demographics and socioeconomic status. It did not help improve the quality of the schools and it made 
                          it harder to build a sense of community. Neighborhood schools are best for everyone.  
                         I  highly  encourage  consideration  of  strategies  to  mitigate  adverse  impact  on  home  values,  such  as 
                          grandfathering in a house, not just the current occupants, to allow future owners to choose between the 
                          old school pyramid and new one.  
                         I  like  the idea of allowing students/parents choosing between the old or new schools when there are 
                          boundary changes.  But the students that opt to stay with their old school should not be serviced by busses, 
                          and I recognize it may make the transition planning more difficult. 
                         I live in my neighborhood for good reason.  Therefore, I expect the schools my child attends are in OUR 
                          neighborhood.   
                         I live in Reston and would like to see all of Reston's families assigned to the same middle and high schools.  
                          It doesn't make sense to send part of the community to South Lakes and part to Herndon.  We are one 
                          community and should have the same schools. 
                         I live in the Langley pyramid and moving to the Herndon one would be tragedy. Herndon means gangs and 
                          drugs, with much lower academic standards and accomplishments. I would move my child away from FCPS 
                          if reassigned to the Herndon pyramid. 
                         I think all students should attend the school that is closest to where they live.  It makes it more difficult for 
                          friendships to be cultivated when you don't live near your school mates.  Longer days on the bus are awful 
                                      Fairfax County Public Schools  December 9, 2021                            P a g e  | 171

                                                                                         FAIRFAX SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIALS 
                         I think only Jr-Sr years should consider staying in the old boundary so kids can graduate together in the 
                          school they most identify with.  Otherwise, everyone soph's and below move. 
                         I will move out of Fairfax County if it changes my child's school or includes "equity" as a factor in school 
                          assignment. Assignments based on race or poverty are illegal and as a Black person, I am not asking for my 
                          child to be around more whites. Minority-heavy schools are not deficient! 
                         I would love to send my child to fcps. Instead of going to the middle school less than a mile away I would 
                          be assigned to a middle school much farther away that I find inferior. Keep kids tied to the neighborhood 
                          schools 
                         If boundary is changed I will send all my future to private school.  
                         If FCPS wants to change boundaries based on OneFairfax, they should be honest about it and let people 
                          decide. As a black single mom who probably is the socioeconomy group you are focused on, quit using my 
                          kids to make yourself feel better and actually help us by making our school better where we are 
                         If my kids have to travel outside the neighborhood for school we will be in private school.  
                         If someone bought a specific house in a specific neighborhood that house should stay in the same pyramid 
                          until it is sold 
                         If  there  is  a  lack  of  space  in  a  school/neighborhood,  solution  should be to create new space in that 
                          school/neighborhood. You should use objective established boundaries and not use arbitrary borders prone 
                          to bias/conflict. Eg. If home is Vienna (not just city) then schools must be in Vienna.  
                         If you change the boundaries, families will just move out to an area where they want their kids to go to 
                          school, making the boundary change pointless. Parents buy their houses where they want their kids to go 
                          to school and don't want the County making that decision. Don't change the boundaries. 
                         I'm concerned that this consulting company seems to have a history of creating artificial means to raise 
                          scores such as mixing high and low performing schools, which simply creates mediocrity everywhere (and 
                          lowers property values) as opposed to a real, long-term solution that truly serves our kids. 
                         immediate changes should be optional for students currently at the high school.  all others levels should 
                          change when change occurs. 
                         Instead of disruptive boundary changes which would not guarantee an improvement anyway, FCPS should 
                          provide  similar  educational  programs  and  quality  in  all  school  pyramids  and  provide  additional 
                          support/services to those who need it more (e.g. Title 1 schools) to achieve educational equity. 
                         It is disgraceful and discriminatory that households which currently have no children in school, yet fund the 
                          schools or may someday have children in school, are not being asked to contribute their opinion. I heard 
                          on last nites call that surveys were sent only to families with school children. Sad. 
                         It is important to keep students in their communities to foster support/attendance/value/etc. Boundaries 
                          should  be  revisited  if  students  are  traveling  lengthy  distances  to  attend  (ie  Herndon  to  Langley  or 
                          Herndon/Oak Hill to Oakton).  
                         It is really important not to separate neighborhoods.  Kids of same grade should all attend same base school.  
                          Do not segregate new kids.  Best time to make transition is middle and then high school.  Do not move kids 
                          during elementary school, let new K enter new school. 
                         it is very disruptive to do this, especially now. can it be addressed next year?  
                         It should not include moving children out of their neighborhood. Create magnet schools in schools that 
                          need additional students and let Fairfax parents decide if they want their children to go there. The parent 
                          is responsible for additional transportation or work with what FCPS provides.(ie TJ)

                                      Boundary Study Supplemental Materials  Final Report 
                  
                                                                                         FAIRFAX SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIALS 
                         I've read your survey objectives. A couple questions. 1) What is the objective of new boundaries? Alleviate 
                          overcrowding, racial redistribution, or other? 2) Why has student performance dropped so much in the past 
                          10 years. How do you measure your GT successes? Call me, 7039669738, former teacher. 
                         Kids have been through enough. Don't risk their emotional needs by ripping them out of their community 
                          school. Add facilities where places are growing before they get overcrowded. Consider open enrollment for 
                          those with overcrowding. Don't focus on unrelated things like their class or race. 
                         Kids in 7th and 8th grades attending middle schools should not have the boundary change affect their high 
                          school.   
                         Last thing FCPS needs to be doing now 
                         Listen to communities. I am a minority woman living in Great Falls and changes based on equity would 
                          adversely impact me.  Boundary changes should first do no harm.  Your decisions will have lasting impacts 
                          on this community, so please listen.  No one in Great Falls is asking for boundary changes. 
                         Make the developers contribute to the building of schools.     
                         make the schools as equal as possible with population diversity (includes social economics).  It is wrong for 
                          some schools to be the only school for the poorest residents while across the street there is a mostly 
                          wealthier school. Those types of districts need to be divided up equally.  
                         Many families are homeschooling and never received this survey. I think that’s a huge disservice the county 
                          is doing by not getting their input. In particular, families that have medical issues that are impacting their 
                          kids from attending fcps this year due to Covid should not be put into new school 
                         Many families purchased homes in areas where they had to pay a premium for the school for the home 
                          because of the school.  I think to re-boundary those schools, would only lead to bigger issues and cause 
                          neighborhoods to see an exodus.  
                         Many parents choose a home based on the school pyramid it is located in and the cost of moving is very 
                          expensive. Should a boundary change for a neighborhood, those families should be able to continue to 
                          attend that same middle & HS that they were planning on attending when the home was purchased. 
                         Many people in Fairfax live where they do because of the schools and/or the community that is largely 
                          centered around the schools. If you must address issues of achievement gaps in certain schools, do it by 
                          helping underperforming students do better, not by manipulating numbers via redistricting. 
                         Modifying boundaries in order to create some kind of "One Fairfax" equity-above-all-else scenario will 
                          destroy neighborhoods, communities and property values (the taxes of which fund these very schools).  
                          Boundaries should be changed as INFREQUENTLY as possible - kids need consistency. 
                         Mote that the forest like school population has been moved multiple times between Langley/cooper and 
                          Herndon/Herndon.   This has occurred on and off b since the 60s.  It is disruptive and unfair to these families, 
                          a number of which have had generations being seriously affected by this.   
                         Moving kids in hopes of achieving different outcomes and ignoring actual academics will create failure. 
                          People with means will leave for private school. 
                         Natural neighborhood boundaries like major roads, waterways, and parks should be considered above 
                          proximity. We live in Fort Hunt. Little Hunting Creek + Mount Vernon Estate provide major separation 
                          between Fort Hunt and Mount Vernon communities.  
                         Neighbor hood schools primary importance to allow carpooling and enable students to be involved in 
                          extracurriculars which often dont correspond to late bus times

                                                                                         FAIRFAX SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIALS 
                         Neighborhood schools are primary importance, you get community, parent  and neighborhood support in 
                          terms of $, volunteerism, sponsorship and alumni assistance.  
                         Neighborhood schools is very important.  Also try as possible to reduce distance to schools as traveling too 
                          far discourages students from extra curricular activities and sports and makes parent envolvement more 
                          difficult 
                         Never change boundaries. 
                         No boundary changes. No need to revise policy. Focus on getting schools to stay open without masks or 
                          covid vaccine mandates first. 
                         No school boundaries change. How do you consider the effect of the real estate? Families bought homes in 
                          certain neighborhoods because of the school boundary. How are you addressing that? 
                         Nobody with a child in the system should be involved in proposing new boundaries (perceived bias).  In the 
                          listening tour, don't offer one option that is tolerable and all other options that suck just so that the county 
                          can say "we got parent feedback before making a decision. 
                         Overcrowded  schools  need  to  have  their  boundaries  re-evaluated  and  borders  drawn  to  reduce 
                          overcrowding. Kids should be attending schools that are close to them and not sent to schools further away 
                          because they are more desirable 
                         overcrowding issues should not only be looked via the lens of boundaries but also of human resources and 
                          the budgetary needs to employ talent that is currently being underpaid and under utilized. 
                         Parents believe that they need to have an AA Program to maintain their house values.  However- if you 
                          have  more  AAP  classes  than  general  education  classes,  and  the  school  has  modular  and/or  trailers 
                          (overcrowded)- then the AA Program should move to a school that has more capacity (despite parents) 
                         People have moved here from all over the world for a specific school and spent a lot of money to live in a 
                          specific hub.  Why don't you work on fixing the broken schools by moving better teachers in rather than 
                          moving students to the worse schools.  You can also build more schools. 
                         Please do not create politically motivated boundaries as happened in 2005 with the Hayfield/South County 
                          issue which resulted in only 10% of Gunston ES students being redistricted to South County due to the 
                          pressure of a special interest group of Mason Neck parents. 
                         Please do not forget the families who moved to a specific area for the schools in that area.  Give the 
                          communities and families a few years notice so they have the opportunity to make a change.  They pay 
                          their fair share of taxes a quite often this can have a negative effect on their home values. 
                         Please don't close the AAP centers.  When there is an AAP "center" at every school, there are often only 
                          enough AAP students for one class, and then the same kids are together in a class all day long every year.  
                          AAP students need their services, including the center, just like SPED students do. 
                         Please don't screw this up by making it controversial - the fcps school board and administration have already 
                          lost  much  credibility  &  respect  among  parents  and  the  community,  please  address  this  issue  with 
                          temperance and common sense.    
                         Please no boundary changes. This will cause stress to the kids when they find out they might not go to the 
                          same school with current friends who attend the school together now. 
                         Please stop trying to social engineer outcomes. One Fairfax is an inherently racist policy and is an insufficient 
                          basis upon which to justify any of these contemplated actions.

                                                                                         FAIRFAX SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIALS 
                         Please try to balance the economic diversity at each school--types of housing usually reflect parental 
                          involvement, volunteers, activities, student's ability to stay after school for help or activities, etc.  Thank 
                          you! 
                         Please, do not change the school boundary.  
                         Policy should look to bringing students to under-enrolled schools assuming they are successful.  Not shifting 
                          and disrupting all students. 
                         Race should not be asked and I refuse to answer  
                         Racial makeup of student population should have no weight in a boundary discussion.  That is social 
                          engineering. 
                         Remove islands and reverse the last redistricting. Certain Vienna neighborhoods were abused by the last 
                          redistributing just because their home schools are popular and the administration decided to kick them out 
                          of the school instead of those who don’t live in Vienna but found an excuse to get in.  
                         Residents of Vienna must be able to send their kids to the schools in Vienna. It is outrageous what you done 
                          to our community. 
                         School boundaries change discussion are the unnecessary exercise in Fairfax county.  It causes unnecessary 
                          community tension and disruption, negative economic impact, all negative consequences!    
                         School  boundaries  need  to  be  stable  and  neighborhood  based.    Schools  with  a  strong 
                          neighborhood/community connection can provide environments supporting students.  There must be 
                          significant, meaningful community engagement in any boundary change considerations. 
                         School boundaries should be completely reexamined - there are too many instances where they make no 
                          sense, and they have been clearly influenced by parents who want their children in the "good" (i.e. less 
                          diverse) school. It should be race-blind and include neighborhoods in close proximity. 
                         Schools in FC can be vastly diff,& diversity comes in many flavors (socio-econ, racial, lingual, etc). FCPS 
                          should have learned by now that "1 size fits all" old boundary techniques have gutted vibrant diverse 
                          schools like Poe MS and Annandale HS. Kids learn from other kids as much as from teachers. 
                         Social engineering and diversity experiments have no place in the education of children. Shifting boundaries 
                          in rational ways (McLean’s overcrowded HS students to Langley) with actions that address actual issues are 
                          one thing.  This is not Carte Blanche to Re-district the entire County for <equity=. 
                         Some people spend countless time, money and resrouces to ensure there children fall within a certain 
                          boundary. Changing would be woefully unfair to parents who moved into a certain area so there children 
                          could attend a specific school (IE, Langley) 
                         Stop playing politics with our children! 
                         STOP RUINING THINGS 
                         Stop using private consulting firms to hide your intentions.  At least have the strength to stand on your 
                          convictions.   
                         Students shouldn’t be crossing highways. Students shouldn’t go to a school when there is a closer one 
                          nearby. 
                         The AA program does not reflect the diversity of FCPS and should not be used to create segregated private 
                          schools within our schools. It causes overcrowding and takes resources away from students who actually 
                          need them.

                                                                                         FAIRFAX SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIALS 
                         The boundaries do not need changed!  Focus on getting kids caught up from severe academic loss during 
                          Covid closure & quit wasting money, time & effort on your socialist agendas!  
                         The boundaries need to stay the same.   
                         The constellation of boundary changes combined with dumbing down curriculum is appalling. In a County 
                          which is trying to attract high tech, the fact that FCPS is dumbing down STEM and trying to cover up failure 
                          by reallocating better performing students to underperforming schools is pathetic. Fix th 
                         The current policy 8130 is fine and allows for many equally important factors to consider because every 
                          situation is unique. Boundary changes are disruptive and should only be done as a last resort. We hope 
                          FCPS will never initiate a boundary change only for social engineering purposes, for example. 
                         The implementation of any policy should begin 12 years from approval so it does not affect current families 
                          and residents. 
                         The main issue in FCPS isn't an outdated boundary policy; it's the hypocrisy and cowardice. They build 
                          additions if kids otherwise would have to go to a "lower-ranked" school but change the boundaries if kids 
                          would get an upgrade to a richer school.  They cater to the loudest, wealthiest parents. 
                         The policy has been revised 7 times since 1986 - achievement gaps don't improve with boundary changes 
                          & exist across all socioeconomic and demographic differences (your data). Provide a quality education at 
                          all schools. Expand capacity & resources for growing communities without bussing kids. 
                         The SB was adamant in their denials when addressing rumors of boundary changes !! 
                         The tax base will be damaged if subdivisions are taken out of high performing pyramids. Although a minority 
                          of residences may have children in school, every residence has a higher value and assessment that will be 
                          reduced if they are reassigned.  
                         There are SO many kids not at their correct schools using friends or relatives addresses or illegally here 
                          especially McLean HS.  Fix that first. Don’t make any kids ride on RT7 it’s really dangerous.  
                         There must be reasons for crowded school (new development, high density residency, etc.), special funds 
                          should be collected from these areas and used to build schools. 
                         There should be a collaborative, inclusive approach if/when a boundary change is determined. Many people 
                          moved to certain areas for the school opportunity.  
                         This is so clearly an issue with Tysons corner real estate construction. I also feel completely attacked as 
                          PART of the reason for our home values is the pyramid. By changing the pyramid to force diversity it will 
                          NOT reflect the neighborhood - it will reflect a leftist agenda to FORCE diversity. 
                         Too many schools are carrying the burden of low-income and at risk students, while other schools near by 
                          have a low free-reduced lunch percentage.  That is taxing on schools in many ways. But changes should not 
                          be forced upon current families unless they agree  (meaning you can be grandfathered in) 
                         We are strong supporters of leaving the boundaries for our area as is to provide the best opportunities, 
                          minimize psychological impact, and neighborhood social quality for our children.  
                         We have purchased a home in the Langley school pyramid solely due to all schools (elementary through 
                          high) being highly rated. We expect that our children will attend schools with similar ratings if boundaries 
                          should change. 
                         We moved recently just to get into our base elementary school 
                         We need to maximize the schools land that is currently available to expand current footprints of schools.

                                                                                         FAIRFAX SUPPLEMENTAL MATERIALS 
                         We purchased a home in our community of great falls to attend the schools here. Changes will impact our 
                          home value which is a reality. Boundaries should be left alone and if additional space needed it should be 
                          installed in this area. If other areas need more/less space changes should be there only. 
                         We purchased our home in the Canterbury/Frost /Woodson pyramid so that our children could attend these 
                          specific schools. We would not support any changes that would require them to attend different schools. 
                          Any boundary change will likely have a significant impact on home prices; extremely unfair.  
                         We should avoid changing the boundaries, but I understand sometimes it is unavoidable.  Trends and 
                          populations will change and we can't change with it every time enrollment drops or increases.   
                         We spent an amazing amount of money on a home specifically to be in the WSHS pyramid. We purchased 
                          this home based on school zoning just last year. Boundaries should absolutely not be redrawn, especially 
                          not when so many families have purchased here based on the schools.  
                         We're wondering why you are doing this? What is wrong with the current policy? Just because it has not 
                          changed in a long time, it doesn't make it bad. What has changed? 
                         When enrolling new to FCPS students, include in the registration process where parents sign that though it 
                          may  be  desirable  to  remain  at  the  school  assigned  now,  population  shifts  may  require  boundary 
                          adjustments and reassignment of students. 
                         When students are required to attend a school outside their community for reasons other than over or 
                          under crowding the justification should be clear, goals established and ongoing evaluation of whether the 
                          goals are achieved. Very few children in my community attend public schools for 30 years.  
                         While I think the boundaries should consider a student population that reflects the diversity that is Fairfax 
                          County, some consideration does need to be given to travel length and to make sure have only certain 
                          populations do the traveling. 
                         while this survey assumes way too much in terms of knowledge / expertise re boundary changes on the 
                          part of the those completing the survey - it will be useful to give FCPS a good idea of the objections to 
                          boundary changes 
                         Why do you need ethnicity and salary this has nothing to do with boundary changes? Actually I had better 
                          questions on boundary changes than these. The last question, the answer <students at certain addresses 
                          will be included in the boundary change= should have been included.  
                         Why does FCPS continue to put students and families last?  
                         Why no mention of the #1 parent request: Allow students to attend any school they want.  And for those 
                          who choose non-public schools, send them an annual $5,000 check to reward them for saving FCPS $18,000 
                          per student.   Make it $10,000 for special needs students. 
                         Why wasted taxpayers' money to pay for the consulting company for this boundary change study to pursue 
                          equity or diversity? Please invest on our schools or kids to have various levels of academic programs to help 
                          our poor performance of schools and students.  
                         With recent (within 10 years) boundary changes, the SB and Leadership have created segregated schools 
                          (Daventry neighborhood and Lewis HS).  If we want true diversity throughout the county, changes like this 
                          should have never been approved.   
                         With the growth in our area the boundary changes need to apply to everyone and need to happen no less 
                          than every 5 years.  Kids are WAY more resilient than you give them credit for.

                         With the lack of bus drivers, travel time/transportation issues should come first! My student would ride 45 
                          minutes on the bus to our base school, when there are two other ES that are only 5 to 7 minutes from our 
                          house.  
                         Work on real issues like bus driver shortages rather than trying to change boundaries. 
                         You have lost all trust of the population. You know the 2019 school board meetings are online where all the 
                          members say this change is specifically because of race (illegal) and socioeconomic balancing. No one of 
                          any race is asking for that, no data shows it will increase performance. Why do you lie 
                         You people are unbelievable and fail the children of FCPS on a daily basis! No child should be on a bus 
                          passing their community school due to their race or their families economic status.  Give parents school 
                          choice so their tax money can go to school that give a damn about their kids not politics.
