                                                         Mrs. Kim Kontra, Governing Board Secretary 
                                                          
                                                          
                                                          
              
              
             1. Call to Order 
             1.1 Governing Board President David Sandoval Calls the Meeting to Order 
             The meeting was called to order at 4:31 pm.  Dr. Sorensen was not present at convene; however, he 
             arrived at approximately 5:00 pm. 
              
             2. Executive Session 
             2.1 Convene Executive Session Pursuant to A.R.S. 38-431.03 (A)(3) - Discussion or consultation for 
             legal advice with the attorney or attorneys of the public body related to Title IX 
             President Sandoval read the agenda item language, explained the process that would be followed: 1) 
             The board will listen to the district, 2) The board will hear public comment, 3) The board will discuss and 
             ask any clarifying questions, 4) The board will vote whether to go into executive session or not.   
              
             He also added that any comments not tied to convening executive session would be heard during open 
             call to the public at the regular meeting at 6:00 pm, reiterating that this agenda item was to determine 
             whether to convene an executive session or not.  President Sandoval then turned to Superintendent, Dr. 
             Reynolds for further clarity. 
                                                                                                 1 
             Regular Governing Board Meeting with Executive Session, Minutes, February 23, 2023  
                   
                  Dr. Reynolds explained that we are here at the request of a board member to receive legal advice 
                  related to Title IX.  He then introduced the Governing Board attorney, Mrs. Lisa Anne Smith, to further 
                  explain the purpose of executive session. 
                   
                  Governing Board attorney, Mrs. Lisa Anne Smith of DeConcini, McDonald, Yetwin, & Lacy, P.C., explained 
                  the purpose of this executive session, stating that it was only for legal advice around what the law 
                  restricts, allows, or requires.  She stated that it was not a time for the attorney or the Board to discuss 
                  policy, what may or may not be done about the advice, nor is it a time to make any decisions.  If there 
                  was a need for discussion and/or ay action, that would occur at a later public meeting.  She reiterated 
                  that his executive session was strictly for legal advice.  
                   
                  President Sandoval then read the expectations of decorum for public comment prior to introducing 
                  speakers.  
                   
                  Public Comment 
                       •   Corrine Haynes – Read an excerpt from a book entitled Battle for the American Mind by Pete 
                           Hegseth, which highlighted the author’s views on subjects such as Black Lives Matter, the 
                           subsequent riots, and how the movement seemed be intertwined with a rapid rise in topics such 
                           as Critical Race Theory and redefining gender. She shared that she thought the plethora of 
                           problems facing public education should be addressed, instead of who can use our children’s 
                           restrooms.  She thinks that the executive session should be in public, not behind closed doors.  
                       •   Tiffany Rivas - Graduate of Peoria Unified, moved from Desert Valley Unified School District to 
                           have her children attend Peoria Unified. She shared that she is scared about what her daughters 
                           will possibly be faced with and have to make decisions about in grade school or high school.  She 
                           also related it to a recent interview with Olympic swimmers regarding what they face in the 
                           locker room.  She does not want public dollars to be spent on building separate restrooms.  She 
                           asked the board to listen to the parents here tonight. 
                       •   Diane Douglas - Former Peoria Unified board member, former Arizona State Superintendent of 
                           Public Instruction, read, in part, the Arizona Revised Statute that allows the Governing Board to 
                           go behind closed doors for legal advice.  She said that this is a loophole that essentially allows 
                           the Board to go behind closed doors and receive legal advice on anything.  She asked this Board 
                           not to be like many other Boards who use and abuse this clause.   
                       •   Mr. Yakov (no first name provided) - Asked why the district couldn't ask for a legal written 
                           opinion instead of an executive session; shared that he thinks this conversation should be held 
                           in public. 
                       •   Becky Smith - Agreed with what everyone has said up to now; thinks that the community should 
                           be informed of what the law is to help in their understanding; stated that she has researched 
                           and provided articles to the board around what has happened in gender neutral bathrooms and 
                           asked that they read prior to any decision making; suggested accommodations be nurses’ 
                           restrooms for students. 
                       •   Mia (no last name given) - Wants executive session to be open to the public; stated that blurring 
                           lines can be dangerous, and that accommodations should be made for the few not the many. 
                           She also thanked Board Clerk, Heather Rooks, for trying to bring transparency and change the 
                           culture and challenged the other board members to follow along; read scripture from the Bible, 
                           Luke 8:17 – <For there is nothing hidden that will not be disclosed, and nothing concealed that 
                           will not be known or brought out into the open.= 
                                                                                                                                    2 
                  Regular Governing Board Meeting with Executive Session, Minutes, February 23, 2023  
                       •   Christina Rogers - Wants executive session to be open and legal advice be given in the public; 
                           taxpayers pay for that legal advice, and the public should be able to hear the advice. Asked what 
                           will happen if we open the doors at school, what would happen at football games. 
                       •   Devon Updegraff Day - called but not present 
                       •   Eric Hayes – Shared that he grew up in this district, and that he is disgusted and disenchanted. 
                           The decision to allow transgender kids to use the opposite restrooms is immoral.  He wants to 
                           bring transparency to PUSD & to the state of AZ. 
                            
                  Prior to introducing the next speaker, President Sandoval reminded the community once again that this 
                  line item is centered around whether or not to convene executive session for legal advice.  He asked 
                  that the community please hold their comments to that particular subject. 
                   
                       •   Jenna LiBrandi – Former Frontier Elementary student, spoke in favor of the conversation being 
                           in public; wants transparency and wants something done when there are concerns brought 
                           forward; suggested that just because issues are not brought forward does not mean they do not 
                           happen 
                       •   Cornel Moca - In support of Board Clerk Heather Rooks and everyone else in the room who has 
                           spoken to have these discussions in public; wants transparency with no manipulation; the 
                           government is for the people by the people 
                       •   Benjamin Larrabee – Thanked the Board for addressing these issues; is In support of having this 
                           conversation in public, not in executive session; last year, shared a report of assault from 
                           Loudon County; urged public conversation around protection of all students 
                       •   Tiffany Benson - Discussions for Title IX should be out in the open; read bill information related 
                           to parental rights; requested policy be enacted that would keep boys from girls’ bathrooms and 
                           vice versa 
                        
                       Prior to introducing the remaining speakers, President Sandoval noted that the 30-minute speaking 
                       limit had expired; however, he would allow the remaining speakers to address the board since there 
                       were so few left. 
                        
                       •   Josh Gray - Supported going into executive session; not against transparency but board should 
                           be able to understand its legal options before being expected to explain that to the public; this 
                           cannot happen in public due to liability issues 
                       •   Brian Hooper - spoke in support of protecting our kids, and of the board being clear and open 
                           with the community 
                       •   Sara Jarrell - keep open to the public for legal advice; wants safety for all students; keep 
                           transparency and an open mind 
                   
                  Board Discussion 
                  Dr. Reynolds reminded the Board that their attorney, Mrs. Lisa Anne Smith, is present if they have any 
                  questions.  
                   
                  Board Clerk Heather Rooks stated that she has thought a lot about this, and she has to provide 
                  transparency.  She said that it is the public's attorney, not the board’s.  She wants the conversation open 
                  to the public. 
                   
                  Board member Melissa Ewing said that it is prudent for the Board to get expert legal advice from the 
                                                                                                                                    3 
                  Regular Governing Board Meeting with Executive Session, Minutes, February 23, 2023  
       attorney, in order to make the best decisions.  This is that opportunity to be able to get that legal advice.   
        
       Board member Rebecca Hill said that she thinks it is great to have transparency.  She shared that it has 
       been difficult to go into executive sessions over the last couple of years to discuss sensitive issues, and 
       then be unable to share anything with the public.  She also said that she thinks we need to involve the 
       community and set some sort of policy to include the public in these decisions. 
        
       President David Sandoval said that he values the opinions and perspectives of everyone and supports a 
       safe and supportive environment for all of our students.  He reiterated that no decisions are made in 
       executive sessions, but they do allow the board to have conversations with their attorney(s) that will 
       help keep the district out of harm's way.   
        
       President Sandoval then asked for a motion to convene the executive session.  Board Clerk Rooks stated 
       that she would like to motion not to go into executive session.  President Sandoval asked if Clerk Rooks 
       was suggesting an alternative motion, to which she stated that she would like to keep the meeting open 
       to the public.  Dr. Reynolds sought to clarify for the Board that if it was voted upon not to go into 
       executive session, this did not mean that the conversation could continue in open session this evening.  
        
       Motion to convene Executive Session pursuant to A.R.S. 38-431.03 (A)(3) - Discussion or consultation for 
       legal advice with the attorney or attorneys of the public body related to Title IX 
        
       Prior to votes being cast, Dr. Sorensen asked for clarification on what a <yes= vote versus a <no= vote 
       meant on this item, stating his understanding that a <yes= vote meant that we would convene executive 
       session for legal advice with the attorney and a <no= vote meant we would not go into executive session 
       and continue on with the regular meeting.  Dr. Reynolds stated that the Board would recess until 6:00 
       pm if the motion failed.   
        
       Mrs. Hill then sought to understand if there could be an open meeting with the lawyer if there was no 
       executive session.  President Sandoval called for order, as there were attendees shouting from the 
       audience.  He then responded to Mrs. Hill that the agenda did not have a line item where the topic could 
       be discussed.  Dr. Reynolds clarified Mrs. Hill’s question, and said that the executive session did not 
       preclude further discussion, just not this evening.  Dr. Sorensen stated his understanding that there 
       could be a future discussion around Title IX in public.  Dr. Reynolds responded that his statement was 
       correct.   
        
       Mrs. Rooks recalled that former Board member, Representative Beverly Pingerelli, had voted not to go 
       into executive session, and that she also knew that a similar instance had occurred at a West-Mec Board 
       meeting.  According to information that the attorney shared, there could be an opportunity to have the 
       conversation in public.  She asked why the Board was not made aware of this by the attorney or the 
       superintendent.  Dr. Reynolds apologized for any confusion and reiterated that the Board cannot discuss 
       a topic that is not on the agenda, and that this was a matter of law.  Mrs. Lisa Anne Smith was then 
       asked by Mrs. Rooks if there were any other situations across the nation or within other school districts 
       where an executive session had moved to open session.  Mrs. Smith responded that there were none 
       that she was counsel on, and that she was unsure if that had happened anywhere else, nor what the 
       justification would have been.  She also stated that there was an exception to that law; however, that 
       exception did not apply in this case.   
        
                                                 4 
       Regular Governing Board Meeting with Executive Session, Minutes, February 23, 2023  
       President Sandoval asked if he understood the attorney correctly when she said that it was up to the 
       District or the Governing Board to communicate information shared in executive session publicly with 
       respect to the legal advice provided.  Mrs. Smith replied that this was not up to any individual board 
       member but to the board as a whole.  She further clarified that the board could ask the attorney to 
       write a memo meant to share with the public, or the board could ask the attorney to give a legal 
       presentation that would provide the information the public was looking for as to the law.  President 
       Sandoval stated that knowing this information, he would support having a conversation with the 
       attorney presentation on a future board agenda.  Dr. Reynolds shared that there are executive sessions 
       that can be moved to the public meeting.  Mrs. Smith stated that if it was a personnel executive session, 
       and the person being discussed requested that the meeting be held in public, that it could be moved to 
       the open session at that point.  The other instance where an item that was scheduled for executive 
       session could be discussed in public is when that topic was agendized later in that same meeting.   
        
       Dr. Sorensen asked Mrs. Smith if receiving legal counsel in public could put the district at risk for 
       litigation.  Mrs. Smith responded that there is a difference in providing a presentation on the law versus 
       legal advice where there are specifics being discussed.  She shared that she is comfortable giving a 
       presentation on the law but not comfortable giving legal advice in a public setting.     
        
       Mrs. Hill reiterated her understanding that a presentation on the law would not include a question and 
       answer session but would allow the board to receive all the pertinent information and act on it 
       accordingly.  Mrs. Smith responded affirmatively.  
        
       Motion remained on the floor from earlier, which was:  
        
       Motion to convene Executive Session pursuant to A.R.S. 38-431.03 (A)(3) - Discussion or consultation for 
       legal advice with the attorney or attorneys of the public body related to Title IX 
        
       Motion by Melissa Ewing, second by David Sandoval. 
       Final Resolution: Motion Fails 
       Yea: Melissa Ewing 
       Nay: David Sandoval, Bill Sorensen, Rebecca Hill, Heather Rooks 
        
       3. Return to Regular Session 
       3.1 Return to Regular Session

                  10. Action Items 
                  10.1 School Social Worker/School Counselor-Mental Health Updated Job Description and Initial Salary 
                  Schedule 
                  Chief Personnel Officer, Mrs. Laura Vesely, presented information on the initial pay schedule and 
                  updated job description for School Social Worker/School Counselor - Mental Health.  She shared that 
                  there are currently 22 employees paid through a grant that needs to be renewed.  Three years ago, the 
                  Arizona Department of Education grant made school districts choose social worker, counselor, or School 
                  Resource Officer.  Now it has been expanded to include all positions.  Mrs. Vesely clarified that this item 
                  is not related to considerations as to whether we have social workers or not. 
                   
                  Public Comment 
                  There were public requests to speak on this item.  The Board listened to public comment prior to their 
                  discussion and subsequent vote. 
                       •   Jenna LiBrandi - spoke against hiring more social workers for PUSD; asked why we are looking at 
                           hiring more when they have not helped the bullying issue 
                       •   Matt George – shared his opinion on the lack of transparency on this agenda item; wants SRO's, 
                           not school counselors 
                       •   Ronda Wong - supports SRO's at schools; daughter confronted by a student in restroom and 
                           student later hit her daughter during lunch; don't take away officers 
                   
                  President Sandoval clarified that this agenda item is about job description and salary schedule, not 
                  hiring of social workers. 
                   
                       •   Becky Smith - shared on behalf of current teacher, thinks the district should bring veteran 
                           certified staff up to the same level as new hires, or in this case, social workers 
                       •   Shiry Sapir - addressed the job description of social workers, read from a national publication 
                           regarding what is taught to school psychologists: anti-racism, diversity and inclusion, equity 
                       •   Mr. Yakov – spoke regarding the current job description for social workers that includes 
                           education on drug abuse, bullying, etc.  Thinks this sounds like former programs such as DARE 
                           and GREAT; also asked why we are paying social workers more than we are paying teachers; 
                           shared that we already have behavioral health interventionists & school psychologists; thinks 
                           district wants social workers because they bring in more money 
                       •   Janelle Bowles - clarified that this grant is to support school safety; wants to use it train our 
                           teachers; thinks we need more SROs 
                   
                  Board Discussion 
                  Mrs. Hill asked how much we are paying from this year to last year in social worker salaries.  Mrs. Vesely 
                  clarified that the pay schedule presented this evening is not an increase.  It is taken from our certified 
                  professionals.  We did not increase any salaries.  Social workers must have a masters level degree, and 
                  this pay schedule brings them in at that dollar amount.  Teachers that have masters also come in at the 
                  same pay.  Mrs. Hill recommended that everyone look at the fine print, as these are often not the final 
                  earnings.  She thinks that when you take God out of everything, this is what you get.  She also said she 
                  finds it difficult to give more money to social workers because this is not the fix to the problem.  Mrs. 
                  Vesely clarified again that this is the level, per Board policy, that we must give for incoming masters level 
                  social workers or teachers. 
                   
                   
                                                                                                                                    9 
                  Regular Governing Board Meeting with Executive Session, Minutes, February 23, 2023  
       Mrs. Rooks shared that she spoke with Mrs. Vesely yesterday and she appreciated the information; 
       however, she accused administration of leaving the board out of the process of applying for these 
       grants.  She stated that she cannot approve something unless she has more information beforehand.  
       She also accused the district of leaving the community out of these conversations, and she questions the 
       numbers. 
        
       Dr. Reynolds asked Mrs. Vesely to clarify again why the job description and the salary schedule were 
       presented for consideration this evening.  Mrs. Vesely stated that the grant allows the district to apply 
       for funding to cover the cost of the social workers salaries that we have on board right now.  She also 
       shared that schools are currently working through a process to apply for the SRO grant.  Administration 
       is bringing this forward so that the district doesn’t lose the monies that have previously paid for the 22 
       social workers we now have, as that grant is ending and a new one is open for applications at this time.   
        
       Mrs. Ewing clarified that the grant funds were specifically for social workers, not training for teachers, as 
       a community member previously suggested. 
        
       Mrs. Vesely clarified that if the salary schedule was not approved this evening, we would move forward 
       funding the current 22 social workers out of Maintenance & Operations, costing the district 
       unnecessarily. 
        
       Dr. Reynolds stated that if these grants were not approved, we would work through a process to fund; 
       however, this item is simply to approve an salary schedule and job description specific to social workers. 
        
       President Sandoval said that if this was not approved, this could be detrimental to our students, 
       including those McKinney Vento homeless students.  
        
       Dr. Sorensen asked if the board voted no on this, if it meant that they would be placed on a certified 
       salary schedule. He sought to clarify that the vote is not whether we are going to go for this grant, but 
       that they would have a separate salary schedule.  Mrs. Vesely stated that this was correct.  It is a 
       communication tool and an attraction tool. 
        
       Mrs. Rooks said that she thinks we are taking the focus away from academics. 
        
       Motion to approve the updated job description for School Social Workers to include School Counselors-
       Mental Health and to approve the new Initial Salary Schedule for Mental Health Professionals as

                  Public Comment 
                       •   Bob Gonzalo - does not want Peoria Flex Academy to leave the campus; thinks that Peoria High 
                           School is used as a dumping ground to solve the problems of the district; thinks Centennial 
                           should be used; also shared that he thinks the best counselors are teachers 
                   
                  Board Discussion 
                  Mrs. Hill thinks that it would be a great mistake to move Peoria Flex Academy from Peoria High School.  
                   
                  Dr. Sorensen said that he thought this was about moving eCampus.  Mr. Molino responded that he is 
                  correct.  Meetings are to convene next week to determine the vision, goals, and needs of Peoria Flex 
                  Academy, and then we will look at the best location for it.  Dr. Sorensen asked that the site leaders have 
                  a significant voice in the conversation, and that no decisions had been made yet.  Mr. Molino said yes, 
                  they would definitely be a large part of the conversation.  Dr. Reynolds clarified that the Board has 
                  received updates along the way, and that the purpose of tonight was for the Board to hear the most 
                  current thinking. 
                                                                                                                                   12 
                  Regular Governing Board Meeting with Executive Session, Minutes, February 23, 2023  
                   
                  President Sandoval stated that he would add to that sentiment, in that we should also include student 
                  voice when it affects them. 
                   
                  Mrs. Rooks said that she, too, could not support moving Peoria Flex Academy.  She also reiterated that 
                  she hoped everyone would take part in making that decision.  She also asked what was being displaced 
                  to move the copy center to Pioneer, and if there was something there, where are we moving it to.  Mr. 
                  Molino responded that this was one of two technology labs at Pioneer.  Since going almost one to one 
                  with laptops, many of our schools have opted to have only one technology lab.  In order to utilize the 
                  resources we have, the computers in the lab to be repurposed at Pioneer would then be moved to 
                  Kachina for use by eCampus.  Mrs. Rooks then asked if staff had been given the opportunity to share 
                  thoughts on moving.  Mr. Molino said that discussions had occurred with every site principal involved, 
                  making sure that they were on board, as well as having walked the site with them.  
                   
                  Mrs. Ewing stated that she appreciated the inclusion of all effected individuals in these conversations.  
                  She recommended asking students who are potentially being moved what about their home campus did 
                  they like best and use those responses to bring over those things to the possible new campus to make 
                  them feel more at home.  Mr. Molino responded that he was always up front with Mrs. Jacob, Principal 
                  at Peoria Flex Academy, and that he is a big supporter of this school.  He also shared that in his time at 
                  Peoria, he had seen many versions of Peoria Flex Academy, and in many different spaces.  He said that 
                  he really wanted to find Peoria Flex Academy their <forever home.=  He also said that he knew future 
                  administrations and boards could make different decisions, but that his wish not only to find a 
                  permanent place for PFA, but also to look at the future of alternative education.  Dr. Reynolds reminded 
                  the Board that any of these possibilities also impact Peoria High School, MET Academy, and eCampus.  
                  He said that all of these would have a voice in the process.  
                   
                  11.2 District Culture and Climate Surveys 
                  Mr. Mike Maas, Director of Research and Planning, presented the information on District Culture and 
                  Climate Surveys. 
                   
                       •   All district surveys are anonymous.

                  COMMUNICATION PLAN 
                       •   Parents will be notified of opening of surveys with encouragement to participate. 
                       •   Parents will be notified of beginning of Student Surveys. 
                       •   Copies of surveys will be posted to District Web site for review 
                   
                  Board Discussion 
                  Mrs. Hill asked about the responses for guidance counselors being low.  She also noted that parents are 
                  taking note of this fact.  She also pointed out that academic support levels are in the 50's and the 60's.  
                  She said that she found this is telling of where we were through last year, and will be interested to see 
                  where we fall in this area this year, noting that we have made strides. 
                   
                  Dr. Sorensen continues to support less questions and being more intentional with the questions.  He 
                  asked Mr. Maas if he had any thoughts on staff exit surveys.  He responded that he is working closely 
                  with Human Resources to review the data 
                   
                  Mrs. Rooks highlighted the 40s ranges in staff professional development.  She suggested using the lower 
                  range questions to see if we have improved.  She also said the higher responses could be removed and 
                  make the lower percentages a starting point from which to look.  Mr. Maas responded that this is the 
                  exact conversation administration has with principals.  It becomes part of the improvement plan and 
                  goals of the principals. 
                   
                  Mrs. Ewing highlighted student results of <My teacher accepts student suggestions,= and <Where do I go 
                  to get help?= both responses being in the lower range.  She suggested that social media is not always 
                  the best way to communicate with our parents.  Mrs. Ewing then asked for the trending responses over 
                  the years.  Mr. Maas said responses were declining as far as how many respond.   
                   
                  President Sandoval thanked Mr. Maas for his work on this.  He asked for future executive summaries of 
                  what they are seeing as board members. 
                   
                  Mrs. Hill found it interesting that the parents who took the survey rated everything higher than the 
                  students.  She pointed out student responses and how low they were, and then suggested we take next 
                  steps and find out why they are low and how we can make it better.
