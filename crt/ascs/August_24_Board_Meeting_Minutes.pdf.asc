       Camila Chavez 
       Mrs. Chavez stated that Delores Huerta Foundation supports the LGBTQ Resources that BCSD has 
       available to support all children in the community. It brings visibility and understanding surrounding 
       the in-born trait in 15% of all people in our society.  She also stated that she had anxiety over her 
       students returning to school as they do not have the option of being vaccinated.    She requested that

       Mary Little 
       Mrs. Little said she is here because all the children matter.  She has been involved in her children’s 
       education and continues to be involved when matters concerning her children’s education is contrary 
       to her beliefs. Schools have an obligation to teach children, and right now she doesn’t have confidence 
       in the school district and what is being taught.   
        
       David Lopez 
       Mr. Lopez thanked the Board for the opportunity to speak. Stated that there was a communication

       he is there to be his children’s voice, and to keep the board accountable. The education of children

       John Vargas

       Dr. Brad Bryan 
       Dr. Bryan served on the COVID-19 response team in Washington.  He stated that doing the same thing, 
       over and over again with the same response is the definition of insanity.  Stated that peer reviewed

       a 99.9% death rate in children from COVID.

       stated that accessibility to water fountains has been taken away.  The District has provided water 
       bottles for students, but that is not sufficient.  Why are the water fountains not available?   
        
       Leilani Tedeski 
       Ms. Tedeski stated that her comments are concerning the Statewide Assessment Test Scores and she is 
       appalled at our test scores.  We are hiding behind Cal OSHA, and making students wear masks.  She 
       suggested the Board focus on math, reading and writing, and not the divisive issues spoken about this 
       evening.

     2.  Superintendent's Report – Mark Luque, Superintendent 
       Superintendent Luque thanked the speakers who came tonight to share their perspectives and voice 
       their comments. He thanked the group of pastors who came to meet with him to have an important 
       conversation surrounding the District and the views of the community. Stated that we must have the 
       conversation and listen to all perspectives to ensure that we have a safe environment of learning for all 
       students. He wanted to make sure that our kids know that we have a safe place for them and that 
       there are people who care for them.  We failed to communicate appropriately to our community 
       regarding the resources that we have available.   
       BCSD is a Title 1 school district that serves over 90% of families who live in poverty, and because of 
       that, we are subject to an ongoing Federal Program Monitoring Review (FPM) that demands that we 
       produce documents and artifacts each time we are reviewed. We are currently going through this 
       process, and tonight we have 22 regulations that are directly related to FPM.  Tonight, we will pull and 
       hold one of those items, because it warrants further discussion. 
       We all want what’s best for kids, and I am here to echo and champion that our kids need to read, write, 
       think, and do math on grade level. We also need to ensure that we are including History, Science and 
       the Arts in education because that improves our kid’s education. This is where he is asking our 
       community to come together to support our kids. We must build bridges and communicate better.  We 
       will get better about that every single day, but we will not be perfect.  Please reach out, we are not too 
       big for critical feedback. Our district is our community, and our community has diverse points of view.  
       BCSD is not mandating vaccines. The options we plan on implementing is a provide proof of 
       vaccination, or submit to weekly testing as mandated by our state.  
       8   
    
       We have had a successful start of the year, even with some positive cases, but we are navigating the 
       greatest challenge in our careers. We are continuing to educate our students through these 
       challenging times. We will continue to work together through and past this pandemic.  
       Superintendent Luque recognized Janie Flores and her impact on Migrant Education and the students 
       of BCSD. Janie has always been the #1 advocate for students in Migrant Education.  We all hope that 
       we can touch students lives and change students lives, and Janie has done it.  Janie has impacted 
       countless lives and has improved the quality of lives for kids.  
       He also recognized Yvonne Lopez who will be retiring this month after a tremendous career advocating 
       for children and education.  She will be missed, but we wish her a wonderful retirement.   
       Let us all remember that we are here for kids not matter what the topic is, and let us continue to have 
       conversations.
