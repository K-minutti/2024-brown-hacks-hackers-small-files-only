                                  of Critical Race Theory

      Office/Custodian - Education/Executive Director of Learning Services 
      
           
     The Board of Education has adopted a resolution opposing principles of Critical Race 
     Theory. This regulation formalizes that intent with implementation guidance. 
      
      
     Background: 
     Nothing in this regulation shall be construed to restrict any expressive activities protected 
     under the Constitution, including academic freedom or student political speech; and  
                        
     Nothing in this regulation shall require any staff member to violate federal or state law; 
     and  
       
     District 49 affirms its commitment and expectation that teachers will rely on the Colorado 
     Academic Standards as the authoritative source for the content of instruction to provide a 
     comprehensive education on America’s history that neither sanitizes its past, nor denies 
     the possibility of moral progress; and  
       
     The Colorado Constitution, in Article IX, Section 15, declares that the directors of each 
     local school district “shall have control of instruction in the public schools of their 
     respective districts,” and C.R.S. 22-32-109 sets forth the role of this Board to “determine 
     the educational programs to be carried on in the schools of the district and to prescribe 
      the textbooks for any course of instruction or study in such programs.”; and   
        
      Public education, properly designed, includes age-appropriate, critical thinking about the 
      history, philosophies, and structures which comprise the American experience, including 
      pertinent instruction regarding the founding ideals of our nation as well as the history of 
      racism and inequality in America; and  
        
      It is consistent with District 49’s cultural compass to use culturally respectful teaching 
      approaches to give guidance on how to use the cultural knowledge, prior experiences, 
      frames of reference, and learning styles of ethnically diverse students to make learning 
      encounters more relevant to and effective for them.  
        
      Implementation: 
        
      D49 will not use principles of Critical Race Theory (as described below) as a curriculum for 
      classroom instruction. With this statement, D49 reiterates that:  
         •  Neither schools, nor instructors, shall assign individuals or groups of students to 
            participate in class or complete assignments based on their racial identity.   
         •  Schools shall not engage in racial bias or stereotyping.  
        
      District leaders and staff shall not promote the following principles associated with Critical 
      Race Theory in D49’s classroom curricula:  
        
         •  Race Essentialism: The assertion that race is the most important identity  
         •  Collectivism: The assertion that group identity is more important than individual 
            identity  
         •  Accusatory characterization of individuals as oppressor or oppressed according to 
            their race 
       
      The guidance in this regulation applies to other district policies and regulations, including 
      but not limited to: 
       
      IE:   Organization of Instruction 
      IG:  Curriculum Development 
      IJ:   Instructional Resources and Materials 
      IKE:  Ensuring All Students Meet Standards 
      IMB: Teaching about Controversial Issues and Use of Controversial Materials
