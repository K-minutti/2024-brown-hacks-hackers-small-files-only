     7.  Public Comments 
        
       Shannon Barnes 
       Ms. Barnes is a Kindergarten teacher at Fletcher and the BETA Vice President. She emailed her concerns 
       to the Board on February 22, and Board Member Tafoya responded stating a response from the district 
       would be forthcoming. She wanted to let the Board know that she has heard nothing back. She wants to 
       save for her retirement using a Roth 403b account, and she cannot move forward without the district 
       approving her request. She currently has a traditional 403b account, but the Roth is a better option for 
       her. The provider she wants is on the approved district list but not the specific type of account. It has 
       been over a year since her initial request. It took the district over two months to deny that request. 
       When she asked for the reasoning or explanation behind the denial, she was not given a response. She 
       wants to be able to save for her retirement with better options. She would like the Board’s help in 
       resolving this issue.  
        
       Ozzy Buckley 
       Mr. Buckley is here tonight with concerns for child safety and the Special Education department. His 
       student was assaulted and kicked by other students and acquired red ant bites on his lower torso. He 
       made a formal request to those in the proper positions to apply positive changes throughout the Special 
       Education department. He went on to list possible changes. His requests are not outlandish. However, 
       failing to make changes to better serve our children is.   
        
       Diana Valdez 
       We need to heed wisdom’s instruction. Where do we get our advice and who is making decisions to get 
       rid of certain programs or curriculum? Too often our teachers are left out in decision making, from 
       furniture to curriculum, often wasting thousands, maybe millions, of dollars. In her 30 years of teaching, 
       too often teachers have to fight and wrestle to get a raise when it should be an easy decision to make. 
       Too often, we teachers work overtime without pay or praise. Too often, the bar is set higher and higher 
       for educators. It is no wonder why less people want to become teachers today. We have had so many 
       PDs that it is difficult to implement them well. It is unrealistic and for many of us it is overwhelming. 
       2   
    
       Admin should also have PDs that will help them develop their interpersonal skills and think outside the 
       box to enhance our schools. Administrators need to be visible, humble and approachable. We need to 
       stop excluding teachers in decision-making and include them in decisions that affect their teaching.  
        
       Ronda Posadas 
       Ms.  Posadas  has  taught  in  this  district  for  19  years.  She  thanked  and  acknowledged  the  sub-
       administration at Owens. They have done a great job. Both men seem to be eager to help us. Their smiles 
       and positive presence are noted and appreciated. This sentiment came from a collection of their entire 
       staff. It is a blessing that the sub-administration are males with a strong positive attitude. The students 
       are responding to them and improvements are being made. She feels they have both done a great job 
       and provided examples. They have brought a sense of control and peace to the campus. She hopes that 
       Ray can stay in this position if Ms. Lobos does not return. She thanked the Board for listening to the staff 
       at Owens.  
        
       Kathy Kozlowski 
       Ms. Kozlowski is a teacher at Franklin and has been teaching for 36 years. She recently heard that the 
       district is planning to replace the Chromebooks with iPads. She is against this decision. She knows that 
       her resources are compatible with Chromebooks, but she does not know if they are compatible with 
       iPads. She is able to assist her students with questions regarding Chromebooks as she is familiar with 
       them. She may be unable to do this with iPads. The cost of repairing a Chromebook is much cheaper 
       than the cost to repair an iPad. She asked the Board to rethink this decision.  
        
       Sabrina Balderas 
       Ms. Balderas is the parent of two students at Thorner elementary. She is here to commend Mrs. Orozco 
       and her team for addressing her questions about the ELOP funding and how it has been allocated to each 
       school site. She referred to a recent performance done by Thorner Elementary at the Education Center. 
       She thanked Superintendent Luque, his administration and the Board for allowing this type of fine arts 
       program to be taught at Thorner Elementary and many other schools. These opportunities have played 
       an important role in building her children’s confidence, self-esteem and ability to speak publicly.  
        
       Katie Hollman 
       Ms. Hollman has been teaching with the district for 18 years. We are testing our students too much. She 
       read a list of the tests she currently needs to give her students in junior high. We lose the entire class 
       period anytime we are giving those tests. She feels that if she puts a test in front of her students, it needs 
       to be something they try their best on every single time otherwise we are building bad habits. When she 
       gives her students a test that she knows she has not taught yet, the kids are not trying or they are failing. 
       She asked if teachers could be asked for their input regarding data and testing.  
        
       Judith Olsson 
       We were acquainted with the fact that she loves children. She wants to see them learn how to grow up 
       into capable, self-reliant citizens. She wants their school years to be as pleasant as possible. She sees 
       teachers, administrators, and support staff as those who nurture and protect the lives and learning 
       capacity of their young charges. She believes the Board of Trustees shares those values with her. In these 
       3   
    
                     days, third party forces have pressed in upon our classrooms adult agendas like critical race theory, which 
                     teaches suspicion and division among races. Transgenderism, a traumatizing philosophy that teachers 
                     the wonder of changing your sex according to your own thinking. These have forced their way into our 
                     school and classroom libraries. It is not a good day for teachers or administrators either. Many of you, 
                     she thinks most of you, are uncomfortable with these ideologies being served to our children at this 
                     time. She spoke upon a particular incident that occurred in Southern California. The state created a law 
                     that forces your cooperation. Do you capitulate to immoral demands, or do you somehow resist them?  
                      
                8.  Approval of Minutes of the Regular Meeting on Tuesday, January 24, 2023
