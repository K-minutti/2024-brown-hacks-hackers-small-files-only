                                   I.      Introduction to Culture, Identity and Race 
                          
                         This unit introduces the concepts of personal identity, cultural identity, race and intersectionality. Essential questions in this unit include: What factors 
                         shape personal identity? What is the difference between nationality, ethnicity, race and culture? What are surface, shallow and deep levels of culture? 
                         How are our views of others shaped by race, ethnicity and culture? What are the most effective tools for authentic inquiry, conversation and writing 
                         about culture, race and identity? Students will use texts from the fields of psychology, anthropology, and sociology as well as essays, articles, and 
                         multimedia from multicultural perspectives. This first unit will also involve explicit instruction and practice in active listening and critical inquiry as a way 
                         of establishing honest and productive dialogue throughout the entire course.    
                          
                         Unit 1.1 
                          
                         This unit will focus on the roles of voice, silence and dialogue in discussions of identity, culture and race. Students will examine a variety of texts and 
                         online sources, develop a vocabulary and skill set for dialogue pertaining to issues of race, and practice using these discussion skills in the classroom.   
                          
                         Unit 1.2 
                         This unit will focus on surface (e.g food, dress), shallow (e.g. body language, courtesy) and deep culture (e.g. patterns of decision making, concepts of 
                         time), and the forces that impact all cultures (e.g. geography, climate, technology). Students will also learn a working vocabulary of essential terms 
                         including: gender, orientation, religion, socioeconomics, race, ethnicity, and nationality.   
                          
                         Unit 1.3  
                         This unit will focus on the concepts of white privilege, normative/dominant white culture, white supremacy, and white fragility. Students will read 
                         White Fragility and related online sources in order to explore whiteness and the often invisible and powerful role it plays in society. 
                          
                         Unit 1.4 
                         This unit will examine the psychology and sociology of racial identity. Focusing on childhood and adolescence, students will read texts that explain how 
                         parental, familial and institutional perspectives on race impact emerging personal identity. Students will read about the distinct and different issues of 
                         racial identity formation in Black, Latinx, Native American, Asian/Pacific Islander, White, Multi-racial individual families and individuals.  
                          
                         Unit 1.5 
                         This unit will ask students to draw on the vocabulary, definitions, concepts and claims of the previous units. Students will use these tools to read, 
                         analyze and discuss selected works of nonfiction (literary essays, journalism and personal narratives) from Side by Side A Multicultural Reader.

                      II.      Origins of Race and Racism 
                         This unit examines the social construct of race and the history of race and structural racism in America. Essential questions in this unit include: How 
                         were concepts and hierarchies of race created in Europe and exported to the new world? How was/is racism politically, economically, and legally woven 
                         into the fabric of American society? How did/do racist, segregationist, assimilationist and anti-racist ideas evolve in America? What role did/does 
                         popular culture and entertainment play in promoting and countering racism in society? How do personal narratives reveal the historical realities of 
                         living with race and racism? Students will use texts from the fields of history, political science, and economics as well as essays, articles, and multimedia 
                         from multicultural perspectives. This second unit will continue the practice of active listening as a tool for critical inquiry into the experiences of others. 
                           
                          
                         Unit 2.1 
                         This unit features the Seeing White podcast series (Duke University public radio). Students will engage in ten episodes of this series tracing the origins of 
                         the concept of race from Europe, through the founding and history of America. Students will wrestle with a variety of complex and varied texts 
                         including: the audio podcast, podcast transcripts, primary source documents, and other informational and research texts. 
                          
                         Unit 2.2 
                         This unit focuses on the construction of systemic/structural racism in America (legally, economically, politically, culturally). Students will read, annotate 
                         and discuss the historical narrative Stamped (based on the text, Stamped from the Beginning) which traces the history of race in America through the 
                         lives of five historical figures (see names below). Students will be introduced to specific forms of racism (e.g. biological, cultural, ethnic, bodily, 
                         behavioral, class, space) and philosophical/political approaches to race (e.g segregation, assimilation, and anti-racism). 
                          
                         Unit 2.3 
                         Expanding on the narrative structure of Stamped, this unit focuses on how personal narratives reveal racism, segregation, assimilation, and anti-racism. 
                         Students will read more selected essays from Side by Side A Multicultural Reader and do research on interviews within NPR’s Story Core website. 
                          
                         Unit 2.4 
                         This final unit combines both the content and the skills from the previous units. Students will use the writing process (drafting, organizing, revising, 
                         editing) and a wide range of communication strategies to connect with different audiences. Students will apply knowledge of media techniques and 
                         multiple genres to create print and nonprint texts.  
                           
                     III.      Effects of Race and Racism

                   useful tool for understanding the effects of race and culture on identity? How did/do memoir and autobiography support and challenge the historical 
                   and literary texts of the dominant culture? How is white culture and white privilege present (and absent) in memoir and personal narratives? How can 
                   memoirs and autobiographies be useful models to enhance a writer’s voice?   
                     
                    
                   3.1 
                   This unit asks students to delve further into reading and analyzing personal narrative, memoir and autobiography. Students will read Ta-Nehisi Coates’ 
                   Between the World and Me and explore the writer’s who proceed him in writing about race directly from personal experience: WEB Dubois, Richard 
                   Wright, Malcolm X, and James Baldwin. Students will examine and discuss the use of the epistolary or letter technique as a frame for personal narrative 
                   and persuasive claims. 
                    
                   3.2 
                   In this unit, students will have the opportunity to read and examine a memoir or autobiography of their own choosing, one that illuminates their own 
                   race, ethnicity and culture and provides them with a model for narrating and reflecting on their own life; or one that exposes them to a race, ethnicity 
                   and culture that wish to explore. As part of the reading analysis, attention will be given to narrative structure, authorial voice, and intended audience. 
                    
                   3.3 
                   In this final unit, students will read and listen to contemporary sources that convey the current effects of racism in society: the prologue of the new 
                   edition of Why are all the black kids sitting together in the cafeteria?, Code Switch NPR podcasts, and 1619 NYTimes podcasts. Students will discuss the 
                   most pressing problems facing racial groups in American society. 
                    
                IV.      Critical Race Theory 
                   The course concludes with the study of Critical Race Theory and the analysis of storytelling through a variety of media using Critical Race Theory. 
                   Essential questions in this unit include: What alternatives exist for framing and examining the role of race in literature, popular media, law, journalism, 
                   and education? How can white race and culture be examined and critiqued? How does Critical Race Theory influence and change the interpretation of 
                   canonical literature and iconic art and entertainment in popular culture? How have writers of color, before, during and after the founding of Critical 
                   Race Theory, represented their experiences through fiction, specifically the novel? How does the concept of intersectionality complicate and expand 
                   the interpretation of characters in literature and popular culture? How does the concept of intersectionality complicate and expand the way we 
                   interpret news and current events?

       Unit 4.1 
       This unit will introduce the tenets and themes of Critical Race Theory. Students will examine and discuss the legal origins of Critical Race Theory and 
       read excerpts of case law within the text Critical Race Theory, An Introduction.  
        
        
       Unit 4.2 
       This unit will more closely examine the ideas of legal storytelling, narrative analysis, counter storytelling, differends, and double-consciousness as 
       defined and applied in Critical Race Theory. Students will explore and discuss these ideas as they apply to complex and varied texts including fiction, 
       journalism (newspaper articles on the Scottsboro trial), and film. Students will continue reading Critical Race Theory, An Introduction. Applying key 
       tenets of CRT, students will read, analyze and discuss the novel and film, To Kill a Mockingbird. 
        
       Unit 4.3 
       Using the content knowledge from the previous units, and the analytical skills practiced in the previous unit, students will apply their knowledge and 
       skills of CRT theory to critique language structure, conventions, grammar, media techniques, and figurative language of varied print and nonprint texts.  
        
        
       Unit 4.4 
       In this final unit, students will read a novel of their choice by a writer whose race and ethnicity is of interest to them (see list above). Reading, analysis, 
       and annotation for this novel will focus on the rhetorical, narrative, and language devices central to the novel and relevant and applicable to race and 
       Critical Race Theory. Students will recognize the main themes of the novel and understand how the writer establishes these themes.
