                                       Presentation Purpose 
         ▪   Why is this topic on the board agenda?
               ▪   This presentation is on the board agenda to provide background and history on APS’ previous and 
                   current equity work.
         ▪   What are we asking the board to do with this information? 
               ▪   There is no action required. This presentation is provided to the Board for context.
         ▪   How is this linked to the Strategic Plan, Vision, Mission, Goals & Core Beliefs? 
               ▪   As one of its Core Beliefs, APS 2020 indicates that <All students must have equitable access to 
                   learning opportunities, technology and environments that support them in reaching their full 
                   potential.=
               ▪   Overall APS 2020 is focused on getting all students to reach common outcomes, while the supports 
                   needed to reach those common outcomes may be different.

        •     The Average Daily Attendance (ADA) for 2016 to 2020 increased slightly for all groups:  District (+1.1 percentage points 
              (ppts.)), Black (+1.7 ppts), Hispanic (+1 ppts), and White (+1.4 ppts).

                                    Discipline: Suspension
    ● Between 2010 and 2019, the percentage of suspensions for Black students decreased by 8.4 ppts., increased for Hispanic 
        students by 4.6 ppts., and decreased for White students by 3.6 ppts.  
    ● Under/Over reports look at the difference between the percentages a group of students comprises of an attribute (in this case, 
        suspensions) and their percentage of the overall population. The percentage of total students represented by these groups 
        decreased for Black (2 ppts.) and White (7.2 ppts.) students, while increasing for Hispanic (3.6 ppts.) students. The under/over 
        representation for Black students decreased 6.4 ppts., increased 1 ppts. for Hispanic students, and increased 3.6 ppts. for White 
        students.

      ● The percentage of total students represented by these groups decreased for Black (2 ppts.) and White (7.2 ppts.) students, 
          while increasing for Hispanic (3.6 ppts.) students. The under/over representation for Black students decreased 1.1 ppts. and 
          increased 5.6 ppts. for White students. For Hispanic students, the under/over representation dropped to -32.6% in 2015, but 
          showed an increase of 1.9 ppts. from 2010 to 2019.

            •    Prior to the adoption of the CMAS assessment, the state of Colorado administered the CSAP and TCAP assessments 
                 (2009 – 2014). 
            •    From 2009 to 2014, the performance of APS as a district and many of the subgroups was largely flat. 
            •    Over that time, the achievement gap between Black and White students grew slightly (1.0 ppts.), while the gap between 
                 Hispanic and White students began to close (2.0 ppts.).
