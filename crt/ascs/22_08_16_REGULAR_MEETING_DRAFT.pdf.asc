        My no vote was due to our consideration of using Dignity Consultants, Inc. and John Krownapple as a potential consultant for our district. I oppose this
        consulting group due to their beliefs which are connected to critical race theory and John Krownapple's admiration, following the ideological connection
        to Ibrahm X. Kenedi and CRT. I do not believe we share common beliefs and do not see any reason why we should or would take consulting advice from
        this group. I believe adopting their mindset would result in harmful policy in the future.

    End Consent Agenda - Committee of the Whole
     
    Report of the Attorney - Christopher Shishko
    School District Attorney Shishko reported on an appeal of Board of Education, Decision No. 18,167 (2022), where the Board sought an order to annul the
    May 17, 2022 election results for three (3) board seats and order a recount or alternatively, to declare overturning the election results as unnecessary. The
    district held its election in five (5) polling locations with each containing a single voting machine except for district 1, which had two machines. An initial
    election count failed to include ballots from the second voting machine. Upon noticing this error, the Assistant Superintendent updated the election results
    which yielded the same outcome for each board seat, as well as the budget vote. Moreover, due to the margins of victory, the updated count did not
    include twenty (20) affidavit ballots as six (6) of those ballots were ineligible to be cast. Thus, the remaining fourteen (14) votes would not have changed
    the outcome in any respect. Notably, a recount will not be ordered absent a substantial attack on the integrity of the tallies and the return of the inspectors
    of election, such as a showing of fraud or improper conduct. The Commissioner held the initial inaccurate vote count was due to a simple computing error
    which was not so pervasive as to vitiate the electoral process or demonstrate informality to the point of laxity in the adherence to the Education Law, nor
    did it rise to the level of fraud or misconduct. Accordingly, the Commissioner dismissed petitioner's remaining contentions and found them without merit.
