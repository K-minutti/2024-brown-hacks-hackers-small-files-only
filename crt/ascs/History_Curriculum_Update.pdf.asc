    Critical Race Theory 
    vs. Culturally 
    Responsive Teaching
           Critical Race Theory
   Critical race theorists hold that the law and legal institutions 
   in the United States are inherently racist insofar as they 
   function to create and maintain social, economic, and 
   political inequalities between whites and nonwhites, 
   especially African Americans.
   This is not taught as part of the curriculum in BCPS,
       Culturally Responsive Teaching
   Culturally responsive teaching (CRT) is a 
   research-based approach to teaching. It 
   connects students’ cultures, languages, and 
   life experiences with what they learn in school. 
   These connections help students access 
   rigorous curriculum and develop higher-level 
   academic skills.

                       system.
                     ● The teacher demonstrates a 
                       commitment to equity and 
                       provides instruction and 
                       classroom strategies that result in 
                       culturally inclusive and responsive 
                       learning environments and 
                       academic achievement for all 
                       students.
