                               Harvey Alumni Association on October 1, and a golf outing with Harvey is being planned.  Mr. Fishel 
                               gave information about the application and consideration process for the Men of Honor 
                               Scholarship. Mr. Fishel read excerpts from two articles with information about Social Emotional 
                               Learning. 
                          C.  Tom Hach - Buildings & Grounds/Operations Committee; Legislative Liaison – The Buildings and 
                               Grounds Committee met on February 8. They discussed converting the house into space for the 
                               Maintenance Department. They talked about building a movable storage building in the overflow 
                               parking lot. Mr. Hach said he thought the snow removal contractors worked out well. Mr. Arlesic

       9.  Superintendent’s Report – Dr. Kalis gave an update on the COVID numbers in the district.  Since August 26, 
         the first day of school, there have been 802 positive cases among students and staff. Riverside’s cases are 
         still the third lowest in Lake County.  The CDC rescinded the mask order on public transportation, so as of 
         February 28, we are no longer requiring masks on school buses. Dr. Kalis gave an update on the Strategic 
         Plan.  Central Office Administrators will meet with the facilitators to finalize the plan on March 17.  There 
         will be a presentation to the Board on March 31 for approval.  Dr. Kalis presented a draft of the 2022-2023 
         school year calendar. Mrs. Aliff published service recognition for all Riverside District employees. Mrs. 
         Lanning spoke about mental health services for students in the district. The district currently contracts with 
         Crossroads and Signature Health for mental health services.  Students must be referred by parents, staff or 
         an IEP. 
     
       10. Treasurer’s Report and Committee Update 
          A.  Belinda Grassi – Finance/Audit and Personnel Committee; Strategic Plan Liaison – Mrs. Grassi 
            received an update from the Strategic Plan facilitator.  She said the process is going well.  The 
            Finance/Audit and Personnel Committee met on February 17. They covered all the items on the 
            agenda.  A Permanent Appropriation revision is needed due to additional funding received. The 
            committee also discussed the difficulty they are having finding tech support employees. 
          B.  Mr. Platko said the boiler replacement project at LaMuth is out for bid. AT&T was added to the cell 
            tower, so we are receiving additional money from American Tower. These proceeds are going into 
            the Turf Replacement fund. We are in the process of purchasing three buses with the State of Ohio 
            School Bus Grant Funding.  
     
       11. Public Participation  
          A.  Public Comment – A Painesville Township resident is concerned that there will be cost cutting 
            measures in the new construction. He is also concerned that meetings are being held for the levy 
            without proper public notice. He asked if the board is presenting both sides of the issue at these 
            meetings. He is concerned that the cost of the project is outdated and materials and lead times 
            have increased greatly since then. He cited the Concord Fire Station as an example of a project that 
            is over budget. 
          
            Another Painesville Township resident said he believes that the board is not being transparent in 
            their information about the levy.  The community has been told the amount of the levy, but not the 
            term. He cited the performance of the district from the state report card and believes that the 
            district is not performing up to the state standards and has not demonstrated that the community 
            should support a levy. Dr. Kalis responded that only Kirtland scored better than Riverside based on 
            the 2021 performance index and overall, Riverside was third in the county on the state report card.  
            Riverside had the most improvement for readers at risk. 
             
            A Painesville Township resident with two students in the district is very concerned about mental 
            health and the crisis that is happening at the campus.  With permission, she read part of a suicide 
            note left by a student to exemplify the seriousness of the problem. She is concerned about the 
            fights that are happening in the schools because of racial slurs, harassment and bullying that occur 
            on a daily basis. 
             
            A Leroy Township resident brought up the admissions change at Auburn.  Districts were not 
            notified of the change. He asked the board if they were going to step in and voice their opinion. He 
            also asked where on social media the meeting notices are posted. He wants more visibility in the 
            postings and feels there needs to be more public representation at the meetings.  
             
            A resident with two students in the district does not feel that race is an issue in the district.  Critical 
            Race Theory will continue to add to the divisiveness and will put a bigger toll on students’ mental 
            health. The district needs to be more focused on helping the students rather than programs that 
            will continue to divide them. 
             
            A Leroy Township resident with three students in the district is against Social Emotional Learning, 
            Critical Race Theory and any derivative of them should be completely eliminated. He spoke about 
            dress code violations and the inconsistency of enforcement. This leads to the problem of discipline 
            in the school and the activities that go on in the bathrooms.  He brought up the school levy and 
            said he is not opposed to providing students with the best possible resources to learn, but does not 
            support the levy. He would like to see both sides of the issue posted on the website, more visibility 
            of meeting notices, and a public debate to fully inform the district’s residents of the ramifications 
            of the levy.
