             Dear Senate Colleagues, 
             1n the Fall semester, Senate voted to approve me as one of the 昀椀ve faculty appointments to serve on the newly 
             formed Strategic Enrollment Management committee led by EVP Ralston. Un昀漀rtunately, my experience did not 
             re昀氀ect "shared decision-making that includes adequate time 昀漀r deliberation and consideration by all constituency 
             groups" as it is described on the committee description and charge (I included a copy of that document recently 
                                                                          th 
             emailed by Patricia Stark to full-time faculty in the packet). There昀漀re, after the December I 0
                                                                           meeting, I 
             decided I could no longer represent 昀愀culty voice on this committee and wrote a letter to SEM members explaining 
             that decision. 
             Yesterday evening, 1 received a two-paragrapl1 email response from the committee which does not address the 
             speci昀椀c 
                  conce爀渀s I raised in the letter: my absence from meeting minutes, the vote, the use ofworkgroups, and 
             connections 
                     to  what occurred last year with SEA and the Student Equity Plan. (I included a copy of the email l 
             received from the committee in the packet). There昀漀re, I decided to make a public comment here today and read 
             the letter I wrote to SEM members so that you know the speci昀椀c reasons why 1 could no longer represent faculty on 
             this committee. As we all know, from the "Equity, Diversity, and inclusion Survey" results, there are many folks 
             who do not feel heard or respected on this campus 昀漀r a variety of reasons. The response I received 昀爀om the 
             committee suggests to me that my concerns have yet to be heard in their entirety or maybe even understood. 
             Thus, my intent in sharing this letter with you, as faculty representatives, is to ask that Senate has a meaningful 
             discussion regarding Senate's role and leadership to manifest much needed change on this campus and to develop 
             meaningful ways to hold 昀漀lks accountable to help create such change. By change, I mean actual change in practice, 
             and not just dialogue or promises of such or promises to do so in the 昀甀ture whenever that may be. 
             Thank You, 
             Melissa 
             Dear Colleagues Serving on t�e Strategic Enrollment Management Committee, 
                           th 
             A氀琀er our December I 0
                            meeting, f met with Academic Senate President, Patricia Stark, to in昀漀rm her of why J 
             could no longer represent 昀愀cul琀礀 voice on this committee. During our meeting, Patricia recommended I write an 
            open Jett.er to explain to you my decision. The short explanation is T 昀攀lt my integrity and dignity were being 
            compromised, and there昀漀re, my decision to leave this group is a conscious attempt to preserve both. 
            To explain further, my decision is analogous to an insight Dr. Marc Lamont Hill expressed during this year's 
             Dorantes Lecture. When he spoke of students of color on predominantly white �am puses he called them "victims uf 
            liberalism": they are now on these campuses as a result of good intentions, but many are ''victims" of such good 
                                             never of the place." That prepositional 
                   because "they're in the place but they're 
            intentions 
                                                                     di昀昀erence is why l chose 
            to leave the committee because I realized I was "in" the committee, but l was not "of" the committee.

            I expressed several conce爀渀s surrounding the idea.of forming workgroups to ful昀椀l! the charge of the committee as iL 
            is described at the rop of ℀✀he meeting agendas. When I offered a possible suggestion to explore an alternative 
            approach, it was received with indi昀昀erence. I do not want to suggest that my concerns or ideas a椀ⴀe the best way 
            forward, but as the discussion continued, it seemed as though the workgroup idea presented by the committee lead 
            was represented as the only option and there was no genuine dialogue encouraged lo explore other approaches nor 
                                            t 
                                            each workgroup is to produce. In fact, as 
            did the committee 昀漀rmulate a clear charge of wha
                                                                      the meeting 
                 transitioned to the last agenda item, my suggesLion to work collectively was highlighted and dismis. sed with the 
                                                                              r
                 asst1mption that there was not enough time

                                                     do so within om meeting timef

                 my 
                    suggestion was not taken ser,iously. Moreover, the of昀椀cial meeting minutes [J included a copy of those 
                                                                       th 
                 minutes in the packet] that have been posted since the December 10
                                                                         meeting do not contain any of my conce爀渀s 
                 or 
                   comments stated. The minutes only reflect the names and statements of those who agreed with the workgroup 
                 idea 
                     or  from those who offered some suggestions of how to meet the targets suggested by Dr. Benjamin's exit report 
                 昀漀r the Board of Trustees. It is as though what I said was never said. 
                 Furthermore, the vote regarding whether to accept the targets shared by Dr. Benjamin in her exit report also didn't 
                 seem 
                     to 昀漀llow our Ground Rules and Principles. This is why I chose to vote "no" because I didn't have the 
                 oppo爀琀unity to communicate that the committee was making this decision 昀漀r the college to the constituents that l 
                 represented. 
                           This item was not placed on the agenda as an item that would be up 昀漀r a vote. We did not discuss the 
                 rationale or the impacts these figures might potentially have. Moreover, such a decision ful昀椀lls a major aspect of the 
                 committees charge, yet it was decided in eight minutes without meaning昀甀l input of Department Chairs which 
                 seemed to be an important group identi昀椀ed as needing inclusion as we work toward developing any targets. Since 
                 my previous ccrncems ∀∀ere not heard, I 昀攀lt as though if I spoke in opposition, 1 would once again be dismissed, so I 
                 said nothing. 
                 Dr. Hill argued that in order to help those students who are "never o/the place" we need to "de-center our world 
                 views." It seems to work toward this goal requires a change in practice because as those ofus who attended 
                 Crossroads training will remember, it is very easy to go with what's familiar and to 昀愀ll back into our normalized 
                 practices. And often those practices impede "de-centering." 
                 During 
                       Howard Deutcb's presentation of the results from the "Inclusion and Equity Sur✀言ey" we took in May 2019, 
                 he emphasized the need for our campus communi琀礀 to make di昀昀erent choices about how to work together: He 
                underscored that the biggest 昀愀ilure our leadership can do is do nothing. In light of our situation, it seems this 
                committee could lead that change. r said it several times that I was truly excited to see such a diverse group of 
                 representatives working together to possibly do just that. Yes, it takes time, it takes a di昀昀erent set of skills, it takes 
                 patience. And to be successful, it requires a deep commitment and a leadership that is truly committed to 
                 "decentering'  our normal practices. 
                                                                       11 
                                                                      1
                 However, these two decisions that occurred during the December 10
                                                                        meeting do not represent this change that OU℀✀ 
                 campus community needs, and there昀漀re, they signi昀礀 to me that I cannot be in this committee any longer. I 
                explained during the meeting tl∀℀,at �he 嘀笀Orkgroup idea will silo the work of the commitiee charge to a few. This 
                decision dilutes diversity. This decision also contributes to what many stated in the "lnclusion and Equity Survey" 
                results thal they felt unheard or that a select 昀攀w make the decisions. I do understand that the workgroups will report 
                 back to the larger committee but having a few people share ideas to then present products to the committee for 
                                      r
                approval is very different f
                                      om having a collaborative brainstorm and plan developed by the entire group. Using 
                workgroups does not seem like an honest effort at collaboration and inclusion. 
                Moreover, what I witnessed al Lhis last meeting seems to reflect a larger patte爀渀 occurring on this campus. This last 
                academic year it became quite clear to many governance groups that there was a probiem with the process of how 
                decisions were made by the Student Equity and Achievement Committee workgroup. And more recently, there were 
                many 
                     conce爀渀s raised about the Student Equity Plan: the process by which it was developed, the inclusion of 
                individuals' names who did not participate in the process or those who participated very minimally, and the need to 
                 create a separate volume Tl so that the meaningful work could be done. Similarities to these two examples seem to 
                                                             dering the ramifications and impact the plan wirl have across 
                be emerging in this committee which is troubling, consi

                this campus. 
                Moving forward, l hope the committee will consider the following recommendations: 
                    I.
                       Begin each meeting reiterating the Committee Ground Rules and Principles
                        Honor the Committee Ground Rules and Principles

                    3.
                       Have a meaning昀甀l conversation about the "Take 5 CRT Toolkit" 1 shared a昀琀er the October 22
                       as a way to be more mind昀甀l about all groups who are impacted by the decisions being made. (Here's a link
                       to the initial email sent that explains the context for doing so) [l included a copy of the email I sent to the
                                              th

                                               in this packet].
            Consider implementing Consensus Decision Making to ensure aH groups are heard. (Here's a link to a
          4.
            website that describes this process but there are other explanations and examples).
            Continue to develop new methods to work collectively - go beyond our normalized practices ofworkgroups
          5.
            and retreats.
        In closing, I want to make it clear that I write this letter not to shame nor blame nor judge, and if this is the 
        perception 
                                                   r 
             please believe this is not my intent. I write this letter to be transparent about why 1 can no longe
        be "in" this committee. I write this letter in hopes that it inspires dialogue to mani昀攀st necessary structural changes 
        and new ways to collaborate wiLhin our institution. l write this letter because it is possible others

                           E.   SBCC's Vision for Success Goals in an Equity-Informed SEM Context 
                                                                                                                                     Z Reisz 
                      Vision for student success was done in Spring, the goals are very straight forward. Increase by 35% the 
                      number of CCC, Decrease the average number of units, Reduce equity gap, and we have equity goals as 
                      well. 
                      All 
                          information is shown in the document above, where a breakdown is given regarding all the goals. The 
                      Chancellor's office has asked for the College to integrate these goals into the framework. The groups are 
                      identified - the Chancellor's office provided the data and provided the report for us. All the Loc�lly 
                      Aligned Goals marked in bold in the document are the selected goals for SBCC.

                      FTES and Efficiency Target Recommendations 
                      HES Budget Allocation Recommendations Workgroups. 
                    Efficiency Target for the College - We have been working on this since 2017. In order to have a global 
                    number, each department still needs to have its own numbers. 
                    525 is the goal, the number SBCC have is 451. The plan has to include all our strategies as a component 
                    part. Looking into the efficiency per department, we can learn how to balance the information. 
                    FTES Allocations will be the budget portion per department. 
                    Alan - Ideas about workgroups -The small groups are able to breakdown the information and bring that 
                    to the larger group for discussion. 
                    Ellen is in favor of the workgroups, to discuss the information in detail and helping guide us into 
                    efficiency. 
                    Patricia agrees with the workgroups to bring a list in detail about each item. 
                    The idea of the workgroup is to talk about structures and analysis for each department. 
                   Arturo agrees with the small group, Deans will not know how their department is doing. 
                   Efficiency is based on the program and we understand the challenges to get to 525. 
                   FTES - Do adjuncts count towards the FTES? Yes, all part-time faculty are added into consideration as 
                   well. 
                   Can some of these conversations happen at the Department level? Rae is suggesting that the Deans have 
                   a conversation with the depa爀琀ments regarding cancel classes, students added, etc. 
                   Program review - some strategies that we discuss here might help for future program reviews and testing 
                   new things. Carola and Patricia are working on seeing the relation of this committee with PEC. PEC 
                   reviewed several programs' responses to  the diversity question, and for those that needed guidance on 
                   going deeper, the committee returned them with suggestions for improving equity outcomes 
                   Sara on Department needs: some of the problems of mapping are that we might not have the 
                                   for the students and classes get canceled due to that. The new tools that we are using to 
                   requirements 
                   build students' plans. If a class is a requirement for a degree then we should use that as a tool to offer 
                   the class that is needed for graduation. 
                   Canceling classes - Patricia proposes that we need a coherent vision - it is disrupted when a faculty 
                   member has a class canceled and it a昀昀ects them on a personal and financial level.

         Strategic Enrollment Management Committee 
         Type: Educational Programs Committee 
         Background: In 2017, the Abbreviated Strategic Enrollment Management Plan established that: A 
         Strategic Enrollment Management Plan (SEMP) will be developed by the Office of Educational Programs. 
         A SEM Committee will be established to guide this process. Members from all constituent 
                                                      groups will be 
         represented. 
         Charge: As an open-entry institution, Santa Barbara City College serves a diverse student body with 
         wide-ranging educational goals. SBCC's Strategic Enrollment Management (SEM) committee 
         encompasses recruitment, enrollment, retention, and goal completion from an institution-wide 
         perspective. At its core, SEM decision-making is student-centered and fiscally responsible. 
         In order to ensure long-term viability, SBCC regularly adapts programs and services to meet the changing 
         needs of its communities and students. SEM addresses current realities, adapts to the changing 
         environment, and includes proactive planning. At Santa Barbara City College,  SEM is a shared 
         responsibility that ensures fiscal stability and viability by optimizing enrollments and integrating SEM 
         into financial planning, budgeting, and allocation processes. 
         Decision-Making Process: The committee will discuss and decide the process for shared 
         decision-making that includes adequate time for deliberation and consideration by all constituency 
         groups. Membership includes both resource (non-voting) and constituent  (Academic Senate, Associated 
         Student Government, Classified Consultation Group, and District administrator) representation. Formal 
         recommendations will receive first- and second-readings by all groups.  Voting on formal 
         recommendations, when necessary, will function with a simple majority vote format.

       Dear Fellow Strategic Enrollment Management Committee Members, 
       I'm writing this email in the spirit of collaboration as we defined in our committee agreements. 
       At this year's NCORE conference, I participated in a workshop given by faculty and administrators from 
                                                                               Portland 
               College. Their talk was to share what they called the ''吀愀ke 5 Took Kit" developed by their District Leaders of 
       Community 
              Council. As the college website explains and from what I learned at the workshop, this toolkit was created in 
       Diversity 
       2014 as part of "a strategic plan that encourages the use of Critical Race Theory (CRT) as part of our business practice 
       and 
          policy-making. CRT is both a paradigm and a practice that challenges dominant systems on race, racism, and 
       inequality. CRT  asks us to examine how and why practices and policies were created-and whom they ultimately serve­
       as a means of challenging institutionalized forms of oppression." 
       Since many of us had the opportunity to participate in the Crossroads workshops, within our cohorts, we started the 
       awareness to challenge such systems because the ways an institution like ours functions can unintentionally exclude 
       even though we as individuals do not mean to do so. 
       What inspires me to share this information now is this week's visit by Chancellor Oakley. Towards the end of the Town 
       Hall,  in answer to a question regarding support for anti-racism work at SBCC, Oakley responded "there may be some of 
       my colleagues in the system who feel that it is not important enough, we are going to continue to try and 
       convince them that it is impo爀琀ant. We are going to ce爀琀ainly give cover and suppo爀琀 to the students and the 
       faculty and the staff that want to raise this." 
       He then reiterated that "the Board of Governor's is going to continue to press. So, I am confident that it is 
       becoming pa爀琀 of the expectation of our system. I am going to do eve爀礀thing possible to make it pa爀琀 of our 
      system's conversation." 
                                                you sta爀琀 taking steps fo爀眀ard and 
       He concluded with "But you can only begin to change if 
                                                                          acknowledge that there 
        a problem. Clearly, you all have seen that there is a problem. Whichever way you come to this, there is a 
       is 
      problem that has been underground for a while in this community that now is being su爀昀aced. It is for, you know, 
      the betterment of our student's future and this community's future that we begin to have a serious conversation 
                                           process to do 
                                                      things that we can do through regulation or law, 
      about it. We will take steps to improve the hiring 
                                          you all have to wrestle with this in 
      but ultimately this is a people issue. Ultimately, 
                                                                    your own way. I can't tell Santa 
      Barbara City College how to wrestle with this. All I can tell you, is that it is impo爀琀ant that you wrestle with this. 
      You will find over time that it was a worthwhile difficult conversation." 
      Considering 
               the importance and impact of the decisions that we will make over the next two years on this committee, I'm 
      sharing this resource as a potential framework because ii might help us to examine our decision-making processes so 
      that as we move forward in the development of our Strategic Enrollment Plan, we, like Portland Community College, can 
                                                                                Toolkit be 
      t爀礀 to be more mindful of "institutionalized forms of oppression." I, therefore, would like to request that this 
      placed on our next agenda as a discussion item to explore that possibility. I also put a copy of this document in the shared 
      google folder under "Resources." 
      In Community, 
      Melissa
