                 Student Equity 
                                        
                On April 28, 2021, Dr. Kofi Akinjide, the principal investigator, and Adela Naranjo-Bernabe, Cand. Ed.d., 
                conducted  two  student  equity  focus  groups  to  assess  the  extent  to  which  students  from  racially 
                minoritized communities are thriving academically, intrapersonally, and interpersonally in MATH 4, 
                MATH 10, MATH 12, MATH 18, BUS 9, and/or PSYCH 2A during the fall 2020 semester at Cabrillo College. 
                One group included students who identify racially as Latinx/a/o American and the second group included 
                students who identify racially as Asian American. This report documents findings gathered from eight (8) 
                students and lends insights into a variety of aspects of students’ experiences with taking a transfer-level 
                mathematics  course  at  Cabrillo  College.  The  limitations  of  this  study  include:  (1)  limited  student 
                participation and (2) focus groups were conducted in the context of a web-based learning environment 
                due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, which is a major deviation from the traditional method of face-
                to-face learning that the majority of students utilize. 
                The key findings are organized into six categories: (1) sense of belonging at Cabrillo College, (2) academic 
                thriving – engaged learning, (3) academic thriving – academic determination, (4) intrapersonal thriving – 
                positive perspective, (5) interpersonal thriving – social connectedness, and (6) interpersonal thriving – 
                diverse citizenship. 
                Key Findings: 
                      Sense of Belonging at Cabrillo College: 
                             When asked what is it like to take math at Cabrillo College as an Asian or Latinx/a/o 
                               American  student,  most  participants  who  responded  to  this  question  expressed  a 
                               positive experience with faculty and tutoring. Participant 2, a student who identified 
                               as Latinx/a/o American, shared: 
                                      I felt really supported . . . as long as I was always talking to my professor, asking 
                                      questions and going to office hours. And there were always opportunities to get 
                                      tutoring. 
                 
                               Additionally, Participant 8, a student who identified as Latinx/a/o American, stated: 
                                      My teacher was very organized. . . . She was very structured and also uploaded her 
                                      notes along with her Zoom conference. Another thing she did was gave us funny 
                                      jokes while she was doing lessons, which made it more lively and concepts were 
                                      easier to grasp. 
                             When asked to what extent did you feel welcome in your particular math class as an Asian 
                               or  Latinx/a/o  American  student,  all  participants  who  responded  to  this  question 
                               expressed  that  they  felt  welcomed.  Participant  3,  a  student  who  identified  as 
                               Latinx/a/o American, noted: 
                                
                Prepared by Dr. Kofi Akinjide, Director of Student Equity and Success. This report was created by the Office of 
                Student Equity at Cabrillo College and any use of this material or portions thereof in the public domain must

                                      One of the things that I liked . . . about the campus platform is being able to 
                                      pronounce your name for your instructors. . . . I grew up with teachers never being 
                                      able to say my name and have gone by my nickname. . . . It felt important to me to 
                                      be able to record my name so that the instructor would be able to pronounce 
                                      it.     
                             When asked to describe their interactions with math faculty at Cabrillo College as an 
                               Asian or Latinx/a/o American student, all participants who responded to this question 
                               expressed  positive  experiences  with  math  faculty.  Participant  5,  a  student  who 
                               identified as Latinx/a/o American, shared: 
                                      I feel like when we were in person, I wouldn’t really go to office hours as much . . . 
                                      because . . . [it] wasn’t worth going to Cabrillo for a few minutes just for a simple 
                                      question. . . . I feel like with Zoom office hours, since I’m home, I can basically 
                                      go any time. . . . And being that it was Zoom, I was more likely to go and ask 
                                      questions. 
                             When asked who are some key people in the math department that conveyed messages 
                               of encouragement and support (e.g., <You belong here.= <You can do it.= <You have what it 
                               takes to be successful.=), two instructors where mentioned: Helene Payne and a PSYCH 
                               2A instructor who was not named. Participant 2, a student who identified as Latinx/a/o 
                               American, shared: 
                                      I've only taken one math course and her name is Helene Payne . . . she was just great, 
                                      absolutely great. Every time I'd go to office hours, she'd be super helpful and she'd 
                                      be very encouraging to me. I'm just a communications major, but she'd be like: 
                                      "You should consider doing STEM, you're great at math. You have the potential to 
                                      do good. You should even try out this club that Cabrillo has for women in STEM." 
                                      I've doubted myself in math multiple times and having that, I was like, "Wait, there's 
                                      so many things I can look into." And it was just because she was telling me, "You're 
                                      doing great and I think you have potential to do awesome things." 
                               Furthermore, Participant 2 stated: 
                                      I've considered . . . [going into STEM]. I think specifically, I was thinking maybe 
                                      following through with communication [studies], but maybe doing my graduate 
                                      degree in something [STEM related]. . . . I've definitely opened my eyes up to all the 
                                      possibilities, maybe even being a teacher in math.   
                             When  asked  how  important  is  being  Asian  or  Latinx/a/o  American  to  you,  all 
                               participants who responded to this question, except for one student, indicated that 
                               it was very important. Participant 3, a student who identified as Latinx/a/o American, 
                               poignantly noted: 
                Prepared by Dr. Kofi Akinjide, Director of Student Equity and Success. This report was created by the Office of 
                Student Equity at Cabrillo College and any use of this material or portions thereof in the public domain must

                                      It's important to me, but it's also confusing. Our family will identify themselves more 
                                      as Chicano, but also recognizing that most of my ancestry and background is Native 
                                      American. There had to be such a denial of that and my parents didn’t teach us 
                                      Spanish because they grew up getting in trouble for it, so it's just this weird thing of 
                                      being  really  proud  of  something  that  you  don't  know  a  ton  about  or  have  a 
                                      connection  to  because  they  thought  that  they  were  serving  us:  to  help  us 
                                      assimilate or just get along. 
                                       
                               Participant 5, who indicated that it was not that important, poignantly noted: 
                                      For me, it's not as important. I've always tried to hide the fact that I'm Latina 
                                      and a lot of it has to do with when I started school. My parents would tell me, if I 
                                      can't translate a paper, then why am I going to school and that they were going to 
                                      pull me out. So there's just a lot of trauma with it. 
                      Academic Thriving – Engaged Learning: 
                             When asked in what ways did the course material in your math class connect to what’s 
                               important in your life, there were two themes that emerged: a professional connection 
                               and no connection. One participant stated: 
                                      At a nonprofit, we're working with foster youth or families affected by domestic 
                                      violence. We're looking at research or studies or surveys, and then trying to see 
                                      where the need is so that you can help them go to a funder and say, "We need money 
                                      because these are the numbers, here's the math that's showing it." So it was helpful 
                                      in terms of how to extract those numbers to tell the story, to get the money.   
                               Participant 2, a student who identified as Latinx/a/o American, shared: 
                                      My math class was . . . MATH 12, which is general statistics and it was hard. . . . We 
                                      didn't focus too much on what was important to me or my major, which . . . doesn't 
                                      require math in general. But a few times there were questions about COVID and 
                                      that was interesting because the statistics and connecting it to our current 
                                      reality, that was pretty good. 
                               Participant 5, a student who identified as Latinx/a/o American and indicated that there 
                               were no connections, noted: 
                                      I  really  haven't  had  that  connection  with  math  connecting  to  my  life  directly. 
                                      Mainly, I use these math skills when in the field of biology, but so far, I haven't 
                                      been able to connect that yet. 
                             When asked to describe their experience with having Asian or Latinx/a/o American 
                               people reflected in the course material, the majority of participants who responded to 
                               this  question  indicated  that  there  was  no  representation.  Participant  8,  who 
                               identified as Latinx/a/o American, stated: 
                Prepared by Dr. Kofi Akinjide, Director of Student Equity and Success. This report was created by the Office of 
                Student Equity at Cabrillo College and any use of this material or portions thereof in the public domain must

                 Student Equity 
                                        
                                      A lot of the material was on number-based calculator work, so there wasn't really 
                                      any representation of a certain ethnicity in the material, but I guess it would 
                                      be hard to. So it's not like it's a bad thing, but it's just because it's a lot of numbers.  
                 
                      Academic Thriving – Academic Determination: 
                             When asked how motivated were you to succeed in your math class, all participants who 
                               responded to this question indicated that they were very motivated. Participant 8 shared: 
                                      I was . . . very motivated to pursue an A. I've always really wanted to receive straight 
                                      A's . . . but I think even then, I was just so interested in the material that it wasn't 
                                      that hard for me to stay motivated. 
                             When asked to describe their experience in their math class with receiving information 
                               about academic support services, all participants who responded to this question 
                               expressed a positive experience. Participant 8 stated: 
                                      One of my teachers . . . Joe Krause . . . was very involved in math plus and he 
                                      would constantly tell people about it. I didn't take advantage of that program or 
                                      I forgot what it was, but I'm sure it's a supportive service. Also, I think Cabrillo 
                                      auto-enrolls us in something. I don't know what it is, but it's a module on 
                                      Canvas and it links you to a bunch of support services, not only for math, but 
                                      even tech stuff and that's pretty helpful. 
                                
                               Additionally, Participant 7, who identified as Latinx/a/o American, shared: 
                                      Professor Reynolds made sure to let us know what learning support resources there 
                                      were. There were many times he emailed us. He made sure things were always 
                                      there. 
                 
                      Intrapersonal Thriving – Positive Perspective: 
                             When asked how would you describe your attitude toward yourself and the learning 
                               process when it comes to math, there were three theme that emerged: a growth mindset, 
                               I’m hard on myself, and it was transactional. Participant 4, a student who identified as 
                               Asian American, shared: 
                                      My attitude toward math is that it has to be done, but I do not enjoy it. So, it's 
                                      something that I've always kind of struggled with, but I know definitely as an Asian 
                                      . . . I've had that weird prejudice come at me, where people have said, "You're 
                                      Asian, why aren't you good at this?" Or, "You're Asian. That's why you did so 
                                      well on the exam." So that has come up a couple of times, but that unfortunately 
                                      has never made me feel like I'm going to be really good at it because I'm Asian.

                             When asked in what ways did your experience in your math class increase or decrease 
                               your attitude toward yourself and the learning process when it comes to math, there were 
                               two  major  themes  that  emerged:  it  increased  my  attitude  and  a  focus  on  learning. 
                               Participant 4 noted: 
                                      I think it increased my attitude about myself in a positive way because I was so 
                                      worried about doing the math class. And then once I was able to not only pass the 
                                      class, but pass it with a B, that really helped my self-esteem, in terms of math. 
                 
                      Interpersonal Thriving – Social Connectedness: 
                             When  asked  to  describe  their  experience  with  forming  and  maintaining  healthy 
                               relationships with other students in their math class who had a different racial identity 
                               than theirs, the majority of participants who responded to this question expressed 
                               a positive experience. Participant 7, a student who identified as Latinx/a/o American, 
                               shared: 
                                      It felt very easy to form healthy relationships with people in my class including those 
                                      of other races through the discussions and things like that. It was a bit more 
                                      difficult to maintain those relationships. 
                 
                               Additionally, Participant 4, who identified as Asian American, stated: 
                                      I never really found it difficult, or I never had any issues with integrating myself with 
                                      different  groups  when  I  was  doing  math  classes.  People  were  always  pretty 
                                      welcoming. And mostly we were all bonded together over a mutual discomfort 
                                      at learning math.  
                             When asked how important it is for you to have healthy relationships with other students 
                               and why, Participant 8, who identified as Latinx/a/o, noted: 
                                      To me it's somewhat important, but it's not like the end of the world for me. I know 
                                      that there's always other resources I can go to, especially at Cabrillo, but I think the 
                                      importance of that has gone up for me because I use to not seek those relationships 
                                      with other students as much and whenever they do pop up, I think, "Oh, I'm glad I 
                                      made this decision to start talking to the person sitting next to me or forming study 
                                      groups." I get the assurance that I'm not the only one struggling or we're all in 
                                      this together type thing. And it's definitely a lot more important for me now to 
                                      create these relationships with fellow students. 
                 
                      Interpersonal Thriving – Diverse Citizenship: 
                             When asked to describe their experience with receiving affirmation from other students 
                               in their math class in relation to being an Asian or Latinx/a/o person, all participants 
                               who responded to this question indicated that they did not receive affirmation from 
                               other students. Participant 8 shared:

                                      Because we never had discussions or anything in my math class . . . nobody knew 
                                      who anybody was. 
                                       
                             When asked to what extent do you feel like being an Asian or Latinx/a/o American person 
                               was valued in your math class, one student, who identified as Latinx/a/o American, 
                               responded by stating: 
                                      It really wasn't discussed, but I didn't feel unvalued.
