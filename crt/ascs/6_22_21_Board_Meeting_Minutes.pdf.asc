     STAFF/BOARD COMMUNICATION
     Ms. Stein commented that she had the pleasure of attending the A.E. Wright Middle School culmination. She spoke
     during the ceremony. It was very emotional seeing the students, faculty and families in person. It was a glorious day.
     Ms. Stein shared that she also attended the Calabasas High School graduation where Dr. Vadehra gave a wonderful
     speech. This was a huge celebration and such a joy to be a part of it. Ms. Stein commented that this will be Ms.
     Amodio's last Board meeting. She thanked Ms. Amodio for her hard work and service over the years. She also thanked
     everyone in the District for stepping up in a leadership role to accomplish the best during the pandemic. She wished
     everyone a relaxing summer as this has been an exhausting year and a half.
      
     Mr. Lawrence shared that he attended the Lindero Canyon Middle school culmination. He had the honor of accepting
     the culminating class. He commented that when he asked the students to rise who received a 4.0 this year, he was
     amazed at how many students rose to the occasion this year during the most difficult times of the pandemic. He also
     thanked Ms. Amodio for her service over the years. She has done so much for the District and her shoes will be hard to
     fill. He shared that he has learned a lot from Ms. Amodio. She will be missed. 
      
     Ms. Menges attended the Mariposa culmination. They have a lot of symbolism that they use at Mariposa. It was a real
     joy and honor to be a part of that. The weather was beautiful which is normally one of the hottest days of the year. She
     also attended the Agoura High School graduation where Ms. Cutbill gave an outstanding speech. Ms. Menges shared
     that she will miss Ms. Amodio as well. 
      
     Dr. Vadehra wished Ms. Amodio well during her retirement. Ms. Amodio is the District historian as well. She will miss
     her a lot. Graduation was incredible. She commended the school administrators for their hard work and success. She
     gave a big shout-out to Dr. Stepenosky, Cabinet, teachers and staff for their hard work this year. Everyone has really
     stepped up this year and shown courage, wisdom and vision. She thanked everyone for making a huge impact on these
     students. 
      
     Ms. Cutbill shared the same sentiments. Graduations and culminations were amazing this year. To have in person
     events was incredible. She attended Agoura High School's graduation. It felt extra special this year as Dr. Finneran's
     daughter was graduating. The site administrators did a phenomenal job of pulling off in person events. The atmosphere
     was great.
      
     Dr. Stepenosky thanked and honored Mr. Willem Henning for helping to run the vaccination clinics which were
     outstanding. Dr. Scifres shared that the vaccination clinic on March 3, 2021 vaccinated 1,100 employees. This was such
     a positive day for staff. Students were then vaccinated at the beginning of May. Dr. Scifres thanked Mr. Henning for his
    partnership. Ms. Cutbill presented a Proclamation on behalf of the Board of Education. Our District is indebted to Mr.
    Henning for his efforts.  
     
    Dr. Stepenosky congratulated Ms. Amodio for her 29 years in LVUSD. Cabinet shared a limerick they wrote for Ms.
    Amodio. The summer reading is Permission to Feel by Dr. Marc Brackett who is a professor at Yale University. Dr.
    Stepenosky has started reading the book which he stated was phenomenal. Dr. Stepenosky shared that the number
    one phone call the District receives is about mask wearing. He continued that LVUSD has to follow the guidelines from
    the California Department of Public Health (CDPH). The decision whether students need to wear masks is solely up to
    CDPH. The District can not make the decision. CDPH has legal authority to dictate what the District does. Dr.
    Stepenosky does not know what will happen in the fall. LVUSD wants the most normal return in the fall. Mr. Lawrence
    clarified that CDPH sets the guidelines and then Los Angeles County Department of Public Health enforces the rules.
    They determine what we can and can not do. If LVUSD does not follow their guidelines, they have the authority to shut
    down the District. Ms. Stein shared that Sheila Kuehl is our county supervisor. Her office is around the corner on Agoura
    Road. She encouraged everyone to reach out to her with concerns like LVUSD has done many times before. Dr.
    Vadehra has also suggested people reach out to their health care provider. Pediatricians have recommended that kids
    above age 2 who have not been vaccinated should still wear masks.   
     
    Dr. Finneran spoke about the Staff Development offered this summer. There are 150 certificated staff that have already
    signed up for Dr Gleason's class on Social Emotional Framework. Dr. Gleason is also teaching two other classes:
    Cognitive Coaching and Adaptive Schools which are 8 day intensive courses. Dr. Finneran is teaching Think Again
    which is about embracing discomfort. Dr Scifres is teaching a class about Positive Psychology. Dr. Duncan is teaching a
    Social Justice class. Valerie Louthian and Hallie Chambers are teaching a course on Energizing Your Core (not body
    core, but capacity, optimism, and relations core) and Ms. Kintz is teaching Mindset in Math. These courses are taught
    through Center EdX. The District will be offering more courses during the school year as well. 
     
    Dr. Gleason shared a slide of the training being taught this week. Cohort 6 of PASC and Cohort 4 of CASC graduated
    last week from our Center EdX credential program. Ms. Cutbill accepted the class. We had that event in person which
    was nice. We now have more than 100 administrators in the community who have graduated from our Center EdX
    program. 
     
    Mr. Klein shared that it has been a busy summer for the tech team. They are working on a lot of projects with relation to
    the Strategic Plan. The team is switching the infrastructure as well as voice reinforcement in the classrooms. Mr. Klein
    is confident that the team will get the majority of the work completed this summer. The District will increase
    internet speeds to be 10 times faster in the fall and working on bringing better tech access to students. He shared that
    Ms. Tina Johnson has been working with Ms. Kintz on camp LVLearns. Ms. Johnson put together an incredible program
    for the kids working on social, emotional and academic growth. The Water District came out and worked with the kids
    on saving water. Every day there is a special activity planned for the students.
     
    Ms. Falk shared that last week the secondary extended school year started at Agoura High School. This week
    Buttercup and elementary started their extended school year programs along with the summer enrichment program. We
    currently have about 300 students participating which is a very high number. The attendance rate has been consistent
    which is wonderful. 
     
    Ms. Kintz shared some pictures of the LVLearns program. The program shares the campus of Yerba Buena, Buttercup
    and the ESY program. The students begin their day with a high interest assembly or presentation. They then continue
    activities with the theme of with character building, environment, multicultural music and art. Then they go into the
    classroom and continue with high literacy activities followed by some exercise. The day ends with STEM activities. The
    students have been very excited and are really enjoying the program.
     
    Ms. Kimmel shared some information about summer projects that are occurring. The maintenance team has started
    their projects with roof repairs, asphalt and concrete repairs, HVAC repairs, and some painting exterior trim work at
    Lindero Canyon and Lupin Hill. Unfortunately, some of the projects we had planned for the summer are running into
    horrible supply chain issues. There are issues with the fencing projects and the marquee at Round Meadow. The White
    Oak and Chaparral playgrounds most likely won't happen this summer before school starts. It has been very
    disappointing hearing the news these past few weeks. There will be a new garden at A.E. Wright which is exciting. 
     
    Dr. Scifres gave a shout-out to Mr. Craig Hochhaus. This will be his last meeting as LVEA President. He thanked Mr.
    Hochhaus for all his hard work and dedication over the past 33 years. Dr. Scifres had the pleasure of working with him
    this year. He learned a lot about him. He is a great advocate for the teachers and the staff at LVUSD. His efforts are
     always student centered. He welcomed Darci Miller who will take Mr. Hochhaus' position and Hallie Chambers who will
     replace Ms. Amodio. He looks forward to working with them. 
      
     Ms. Amodio thanked everyone for their good wishes, kind words and support through the years. She is grateful to this
     Board, Cabinet and staff for their teamwork and collaboration. It has been her honor to serve this District. She feels
     blessed to have worked for the benefit of students. Ms. Amodio welcomed Ms. Hallie Chambers. Las Virgenes
     Classified Association (LVCA) and LVUSD have reached tentative agreements during negotiations. The agreement will
     be on the agenda tonight. Ms. Amodio acknowledged the LVCA and LVUSD bargaining teams.
      
     COMMENTS FROM THE AUDIENCE REGARDING ITEMS NOT ON THE AGENDA

    school site teams approved the changes so that if there were two days of no school due to fire or smoke the schools
    would not need to make up the instructional minutes if the State of California does not allow for this flexibility. These
