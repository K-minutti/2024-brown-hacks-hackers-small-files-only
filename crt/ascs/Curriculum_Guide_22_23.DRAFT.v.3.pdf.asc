                  fulfill graduation requirements, and take advantage of the electives available to all students.  Please keep 
                  in mind that the District reserves the right not to offer courses listed.  If a course is canceled, the student 
                  will be assigned to his/her alternate choice.  Students and parents/guardians are encouraged to gather 
                  information from this guide and discuss course selections for the upcoming school year with current 
                  teachers and guidance counselors. 
                   
                  PROMOTION

                  In order for a 6 , 7  or 8  grade student to move to the next grade level, the student must successfully 
                  pass the current grade level curriculum or have an administrative recommendation. It should be understood 
                  by parents and students that promotion at the high school level is not a guarantee of graduation and a 
                  diploma.  Promotion allows a student to be considered as a member of a particular cohort of students who 
                  entered high school at the beginning of a particular year. Being promoted to the 12th grade does not 
                  necessarily imply that a student will be eligible to graduate from high school at the end of his/her 
                  12th grade year.  Graduation is determined by a student9s completing the graduation requirements as set 
                  forth in Board policy and the state of Pennsylvania.  The principal or their designee has the authority to 
                  adjust a student9s course sequence in order to help assure that the student will be able to graduate in four 
                  years. The promotion guidelines below are meant to represent a typical student. Unique/extenuating 
                  circumstances may qualify students for a non-typical path:

                  In accordance with 22 PA Code, Chapter 4, section 4.24, Demonstration of proficiency as determined 
                  by the school district, charter school (including a cyber charter school) or AVTS, if applicable, in each of 
                  the state academic standards not assessed by a state assessment under § 4.51, § 4.51a or § 4.51b (relating 
                  to state assessment system; Pennsylvania System of School Assessment; and Keystone Exams). 
                   
                  The Senior Project is a major research project that focuses on a career field in which students are 
                  interested. Students will create a graduation portfolio that represents career exploration through research 
                  and real-world experiences.  Students will have written assignments that include but are not limited to a 
                  resume, research reflection and various field experiences related to their topic.  Students will also give a 
                  presentation on their research and any field work they completed as part of an exit interview.  The 
                  graduation portfolio is mandatory for each senior and will be completed through their English class with 
                  the assistance of the College and Career Center.  
                   
                  Please Note: As of the Spring of 2023, Act 158 states that there are 5 total pathways available for 
                  graduation in the state of Pennsylvania, as outlined in the graphic below. If you have questions 
                  regarding Act 158, or any of the Pathways, please see the guidance department at the High School.

                  The Woodland Hills School District requires  that  all  students  participate  in  the  Keystone  Algebra, 
                                                                                                th
                  Biology, and Literature Exams prior to their 12  grade year. Students who do not demonstrate mastery 
                  through of a score of Proficient or Advanced, or do not participate in the exam(s), are required to 
                  participate in a Keystone Workshop – or to take an additional Math course, in the case of the Algebra 
                  Keystone. In the event that a student does not score Proficient or Advanced on a Keystone exam, a passing 
                  grade of 60% in the Keystone Workshop is required for a student to meet graduation requirements.

                  Likewise,  students  in  6 ,  7 ,  and  8   grades  will  take  the  state  mandated  PSSA  Exams  in  ELA, 
                  Mathematics, and Science (8th grade only). Students who do not demonstrate mastery through a score of 
                  either Proficient or Advanced are eligible for placement in a Workshop for additional support. 
                   
                  GRADE 6 
                   
                  The Woodland Hills School District is including our 6th grade students in the Course Selection process. 
                  All students in grade 6 will have the opportunity to take ELA (or Honors ELA), Math (or Honors Math), 
                  Literature Studies (or Honors Lit. Studies), Science, Social Studies, Library, Health, PE, and STEAM. 
                  Students in Grade 6 will also be placed in a 9-week elective rotation including Art, Music, FCS, and Skills 
                  Building; or one full-year of Chorus, Band, or Orchestra, if recommended. Please Note: 6th grade is an 
                  extremely important year for scholars and families. The classes chosen starting in 7th grade, and again in 
                    th
                  9  grade, could determine a scholar9s ability to take higher level honors/AP courses in high school. We 
                  highly encourage scholars and families to speak with the School Counselors at school when making these 
                  decisions. 
                   
                  CAREER PATHWAYS 
                  A career pathway is an organized approach to career planning. Creating a career pathway means plotting 
                  a course for identifying occupational interests, determining education and training needs and establishing 
                  an action plan for reaching career goals.  
                   
                    •     A Pathway is a sequence of courses within your area of interest. 
                    •     A Pathway will connect your career interests from high school to college and/or career. 
                    •     A Pathway is your educational road map guiding you to the high school courses and post-secondary 
                          options most relevant to your chosen career destination. 
                    •     A Pathway will help you acquire the depth of knowledge and skill linked with specific post-secondary 
                          programs that will lead to a certificate or degree and/or career. 
                    •     You choose, you decide what Pathway is right for you.

                  Students will work closely with guidance counselors and school administrators to determine which Career 
                  Pathway meets their interests.  Students will be exposed to all areas of the curriculum through interest 
                  level learning beginning in the 8th grade.  Students will complete a self-assessment using the Holland Code 
                                                                                                                                                
                  which is a theoretical framework developed by psychologist John L. Holland. Each letter or code stands 
                  for a particular "type": Realistic (Doers), Investigative (Thinkers), Artistic (Creators), Social (Helpers), 
                  Enterprising  (Persuaders),  and  Conventional  (Organizers).    Students  can  access  the  code  at 
                  www.pacareerzone.org. 
                   
                  Students will have the ability to change Career Pathways if their interests change.  
                   
                  NINE WEEK GRADES 
                   
                  Every course in which students are enrolled will yield a number of points, which will be used to determine 
                  their Quality Point Average (QPA).  All subjects are included.  The number of points earned for a course 
                  is based upon the following formula: 
                   
                                                       90-100%                 80-89%                  70-79%                  60-69%                  50-59% 
                  Regular Course                       A = 4                   B = 3                   C = 2                   D = 1                   F = 0 
                  Weighted Course                      A = 5                   B = 4                   C = 2                   D = 1                   F = 0 
                   
                  HONOR ROLL 
                   
                  The Honor Roll is calculated at the end of each nine-week grading period.  Only the grades from that nine-
                  week9s grading period are used in the calculation.  Weighted courses have 10 points added to percentage 
                  grades and 1 point added to the numerical value of letter grades of A and B.  Criteria for the honor roll are 
                  listed below. 
                   
                  Distinguished Scholar:                           4.00 and above 
                  High Honors:                                     3.50-3.99 
                  Honors:                                          3.00-3.49 
                   
                  Students cannot be on the Honor Roll if they: 
                   
                               1.          Have Incomplete grades 
                               2.          Received any grade below 70% 
                               3.          Are in violation of the District's attendance policy 
                   
                   
                  CLASS RANK 
                   
                  All subjects are included when calculating class rank. Rank is based on letter grades earned in grades 9, 
                  10, 11, and 12.  Final percentage grades are converted to letter grades and the letter grades are used to 
                  arrive at a quality point average based on a 4.0+ scale for rank.  All students with a 4.0 or better QPA will 
                  be ranked number one in their respective class.  There will be no valedictorian or salutatorian.

                  WEIGHTED COURSES and AP COURSES 
                   
                  Weighted credit shall be given only to the highest level of a course taught by any department that currently 
                  has weighted courses, or to any course taught at Woodland Hills High School for which an option is 
                  provided to obtain college credit, or to any course which is structured on concepts which will enable a 
                  student to be placed in college courses above the introductory level.  Those courses are:

                  While there are no set eligibility criteria for these classes, students need to consult with their current 
                  teachers and guidance counselors before selecting an AP level course.  A solid  GPA and excellent 
                  attendance are two indicators of possible success.   Students who fail to achieve a 70% or better during 
                  the first marking period may be reassigned to another course at the appropriate grade level. 
                   
                  WOODLAND HILLS CLASS RANK/GPA CALCULATION 
                   
                  Below is the formula that will be used in determining the GPA9s for students.  Below you will find a 
                  simple example of how grades, quality points, and credits will be used throughout the year to determine 
                  the GPA. 
                   
                  Every percentage grade in the system has a specific quality point value assigned to it: 
                   
                       (100-90=A,   80-89=B,   70-79=C,   60-69=D,   and 59-0=F) 
                             
                       Level 1 courses have the following values: A=4.0, B=3.0, C=2.0, D=1.0, and F=0.0 
                       Level 2 courses (weighted course) have the following values: A=5.0, B=4.0, C=2.0, D=1.0, and F=0.0 
                   
                   
                                                                    
                                                                                                                                                                      Page 16

                  CREDIT RECOVERY 
                   
                  In order to assist students in earning all of their required academic credits, Woodland Hills  High School 
                  has a credit recovery program.  Credit recovery is available to all students who need to make up a course 
                  that has been failed.  The credit recovery program utilizes Edgenuity, a curriculum software program that 
                  is aligned with the Woodland Hills curriculum. In general, credit recovery is limited to required core 
                  academic  courses  (i.e.  Mathematics,  English,  Social  Studies  and  Science).    There  will  be  regular 
                  interaction between the student and the teacher during the term of the credit recovery course.  The 
                  Guidance office can provide additional details on the credit recovery program.  
                     
                  POLICY GOVERNING SCHEDULE CHANGES AND SUMMER SCHOOL 
                   
                  Students  are  responsible  for  verifying  their  course  selections  and  for  informing  the 
                  counselor/administrator of any changes prior to the end of the previous school year.  Any other changes 
                  that are the result of errors or summer school courses need to be brought to the counselor9s attention by 
                  the second week of school.  Changes will be made to correct errors or account for passing summer school 
                  courses.  The counseling office should be notified two weeks prior to the beginning of school regarding 
                  any necessary changes.  Students must document all work successfully completed in an approved summer 
                  school program and submit an official transcript of grades. 
                   
                  Schedule changes during the first two weeks of school will be limited to those students who need to 
                  eliminate schedule conflicts or to adjust a schedule to meet graduation or period-per-week requirements.  
                  NO CONVENIENCE CHANGES WILL BE MADE.  Final approval for changes will be made by the 
                  building principal. 
                   
                  In selecting a course, a student is making a commitment to the entire length of the school year or semester, 
                  if applicable.  A student will receive two nine-week grades, a mid-term and a final exam in a one-semester 
                  course.  A full-year course includes four nine-week grades, a mid-term exam and a final exam grade. 
                   
                  No students may enroll in any course during the regular school year outside of the District without prior 
                  approval of the Principal or designee in order to receive credit. 
                   
                  NOTE: If a student withdraws from any course, for any reason, it is the student’s responsibility to 
                  see that the Withdrawal Form is completed and signed by all four required persons in the proper 
                  sequence (Parent, Teacher of class being dropped, Counselor, and Principal).

            WOODLAND HILLS ONLINE ACADEMY (WHOA) 
             
            Woodland Hills defines the goal of a blended learning approach as the ability to join the best aspects of both face-
            to-face and online instruction.  In addition to flexibility and convenience for students, according to research, there 
            is early evidence that a blended instructional approach can result in learning outcome gains for certain students. 
             
            Students expressing interest in the Woodland Hills Online Academy are expected to have basic computer skills 
            and be willing to follow all Academy guidelines.  Students must be able to manage their time and to work 
            productively in a less restrictive learning environment. The Woodland Hills Online Academy, as part of its 
            registration process, will review current transcripts and complete a diploma audit. A student may be declined 
            enrollment if the District Staff determine that enrollment in the Woodland Hills Online Academy will not afford 
            the student an opportunity to gain required credits and/or to meet graduation requirements in a timely fashion.  
            Enrollment may be declined also if the District Staff determine Academy course options do not allow a student 
            to continue his/her studies in a particular content area or course options do not match a student9s career focus 
            and/or special interests.  Enrollment may be declined also for students who have pending disciplinary matters 
            and/or for students who entered into legally binding agreements with the district in lieu of formal expulsion. 
             
            Interested  students  and  their  parents/guardians  must  complete  all  district  enrollment  forms  as  a  means  of 
            confirming residency and program eligibility.  Upon receipt of registration forms and an academic transcript, a 
            representative of the Woodland Hills Online Academy Program will review all documents and confirm program 
            eligibility based on progress made toward Woodland Hills School District graduation requirements and current 
            online course options.  Once eligibility has been confirmed, the District Facilitator will contact each student to 
            arrange an interview to discuss program expectations and guidelines  and to discuss each student9s online 
            scheduling option.  Each student should investigate the specific subject requirements needed for admission to 
                                                                                                                                                                      Page 19 
                   
          
         post -secondary schools of his/her choice and/or course requirements specific to his/her area of career interest. 
          
         An orientation will be scheduled for those students/families who wish to finalize their enrollment in the 
         Woodland Hills Online Academy.  The orientation will cover topics relevant to login procedures, academic and 
         technology support options, tips for online success, etc. 
           
         While students are not required to meet face-to-face with their teachers, it is highly recommended that they meet 
         either  in  person  or  through  video:  Facetime,  Skype,  etc.  If  students  must  report  to  school  to  complete 
         state standardized testing, the district will provide transportation on the arranged day/days. Students are expected 
         to log into the course work each day for a minimum amount of time and work. Students are subject to all Woodland 
         Hills School District policies and procedures.  Please see your school counselor for more information. At this time,

       ENGLISH LANGUAGE ARTS 
       The  English  Language  Arts  (ELA)  program  within  the  Woodland  Hills  School  District  fosters  intellectual 
       engagement and maturation through the study of literature and language, with the goal of developing critical 
       readers, writers, and thinkers. This is accomplished through student-centered instruction, where students are 
       actively engaged in the learning environment. In addition to a core literacy program, students take ownership of 
       content through reading projects and twenty-first century authentic media.   
        
       Summer Reading 
       The Woodland Hills School District fosters an interest in the habit and life skill of 
       reading. We encourage students to become lifelong readers and to improve their 
       reading through the practice of reading. For these reasons, we require all of our 
       students to read over the summer and complete the accompanying assignments, 
       which are due on the first day of the upcoming school  year. Furthermore, a 
       comprehensive  test  and/or  essay  will  be  administered  and/or  assigned.  The 
       following courses have a summer reading requirement: ELA 7, Honors ELA 7, ELA 8, Honors ELA 8, 
       English 9, Honors English 9, English 10, Honors English 10, English 11, Honors English 11, AP English 11,

       Note: Students may obtain their summer reading information from their current English teachers; students may 
       be required to obtain novels independently from an outside source. The summer reading information is also 
       available on the Woodland Hills School District website.

            1.0 credit / 1 year 
            Intro to Algebra will primarily focus on making sure that students continue to build the foundation and necessary 
            skills that will be required to succeed in Algebra 1, Algebra 2, and Geometry.  Instructional time will focus on 
            three  critical  areas:  1)  formulating  and  reasoning  about  expressions  and  equations,  including  modeling  an 
            association in bivariate data with a linear equation, and solving linear equations and systems of linear equations; 
            2) grasping the concept of a function and using functions to describe quantitative relationships; and 3) analyzing 
            two- and three-dimensional space and figures using distance, angle, similarity, and congruence, and understanding 
            and applying the Pythagorean Theorem. We will take a problem-solving approach that will require students to be 
            able to explain their reasoning and thinking process. Each lesson developed for class will address these important 
            themes as well as keep each student actively engaged. Appropriate pacing will occur to ensure that no student is 
            left behind and challenges will be available to those students who are able to excel in the area of mathematics.

      Grades 10, 11, 12 /1.0 credit/ (W) /1 year 
      Honors Humanities & Cultural Roots provides a truly interdisciplinary introduction to the Western Humanities 
      through the concept of <cultural roots.=  The student9s personal growth should take place on three levels – 
      historical, aesthetic, and philosophical.   In our examination of these <cultural roots,= we will focus on certain 
      periods and monuments rather than to survey western civilization.  For example, the focus for the Greco- Roman 
      roots is on Athens during the fifth century B.C.E.  Similarly, in our treatment of West Africa, we will focus on 
      the culture of the Yoruba people, rather than to survey all of the cultures from this part of the world. While we 
      study the <roots= of the Judeo-Christian tradition in the Bible, with selections from the Old and New Testaments, 
      we will focus on the relations of art and thought in the Gothic cathedral, with specific examples such as Chartres, 
      during the European Middle Ages.  The chapter on Byzantium and Islam will help to clarify the context of this 
      focal culture.  The course offers students training in reading college-level texts, classical philosophy, Green 
      dramatists, art history, and classical opera including Verdi9s Aida.  Students will be given a breadth of knowledge 
      valuable  for  college  preparation  as  well  as  for  future  personal  pleasure  and  enrichment.  Recommended 
      path: Students should have obtained 80 percent average or more in advanced or honors social studies and English

    ART 
     
    Art Education is not intended to make career artists out of all students; it is to enable them to be whole persons.  
    Art is an important part of the lives of all people and all cultures. Without Art there would be no visual record of 
    history.   Art speaks to every person in different ways – emotionally and intellectually.  Art is a living <language= 
    that touches all people9s lives (i.e., styles of buildings, car design, furniture design, public sculpture, paintings, 
    jewelry, etc.)   
     
    Big Ideas: 
     
      ●  People have expressed experiences and ideas through the arts throughout time and across cultures. 
      ●  There are formal and informal processes used to assess the quality of works in the arts. 
      ●  People use both aesthetic and critical processes to assess quality, interpret meaning and determine value. 
      ●  The skills, techniques, elements and principles of the arts can be learned, studied, refined and practiced. 
      ●  Artists use tools and resources as well as their own experiences and skills to create art.

     WOODLAND HILLS SCHOOL DISTRICT POLICY 
      
     105.1. CURRICULUM REVIEW BY PARENTS AND STUDENTS  
      
     The Woodland Hills School District is required by the State Board of Education to assure that parents 
     have access to information about the curriculum. The district shall adopt policies to assure that parents 
     have access to information about the approved curriculum, including student learning, outcomes as stated 
     in  the  district's  Strategic  Plan  (effective  beginning  1997-98  school  term),  books  and  instructional 
     materials, and assessment techniques. The district will make available existing information about the 
     curriculum utilizing the following procedural steps:  
      
       1.  The parent/guardian must submit a request, in writing, to the respective building principal stating 
         the specific curriculum and/or material being sought for review.  
          
       2.  The building principal will respond, in writing, within ten (10) school days by providing the time, 
         date, and location of the review.  
          
          
       3.  The respective building's school counselor, or another professional staff member designated by 
         the building principal, will oversee the review of the requested materials.  
          
       4.  Requested materials to be reviewed are not to be removed from the building, but photocopying is 
         allowable and will be permitted in accordance with Photocopy Policy #711, adopted March 13, 
         1996.  
      
      
     105.2. EXEMPTION FROM INSTRUCTION  
      
     The Woodland Hills School District is comprised of a population with a diversity of religious, ethnic, and 
     cultural beliefs. This diversity is expressed in the belief statements of the district's Strategic Plan (effective 
     beginning of 1997-98 school term). The Board assures parents/guardians the right to have their children 
     excused from specific instruction which conflicts with their religious, ethnic, and cultural beliefs. The 
     district shall adopt policies to assure that parents/guardians have their children excused from specific 
     instruction which conflicts with their religious beliefs. The Woodland Hills School District shall excuse 
     any student from specific instruction which conflicts with their religious, ethnic, and cultural beliefs 
     subject to the following guidelines:  
      
       1.  A request must be made by the parent/guardian, in writing, to the respective building principal, 
         clarifying the specific instruction from which the student is to be excused. As used in this policy, 
         the phrase specific instruction is defined as elements of instruction by the teacher. It does not 
         include required learning outcomes as stated in the district's Strategic Plan.  
          
       2.  The written request to be excused shall be sent by the qualifying parent/guardian or student to the 
         building principal, in quadruplicate. One (1) copy shall be retained in the student's permanent 
         school records. One (1) copy shall be kept by the school principal, and one (1) copy shall be 
                                              Page 91 
             
                   submitted to the teacher from whose instruction the student is to be excused. One (1) copy shall 
                   be kept in the possession of the Superintendent or his/her designee.  
               3.  It shall be the responsibility of the student to request permission to leave class when the specific 
                   instruction objected to is being presented or is about to be presented. When the student seeks to be 
                   excused, the teacher shall excuse the student if the teacher or principal has a copy of the written 
                   request and the written request adequately describes the specific instruction.  
                    
               4.  The written request must contain a statement that the specific instruction described conflicts with 
                   the religious beliefs of the student or the parents/ guardians.  
                    
               5.  The parent/guardian and/or student may request suggested replacement educational activities. The 
                   only  permissible  educational  activity  for  this  purpose  shall  be  in  the  nature  of  replacement 
                   instruction that is consistent with the goals set for the course and does not require the provision of 
                   any extra resources by the district.  
             
               6.  The building principal shall determine where the student shall report during the time the student is 
                   excused.  
             
               7.  All students excused from specific instruction shall be required to achieve the learning outcomes 
                   established by the district in its Strategic Plan and are necessary for graduation.

            Implementation of this policy is primarily the responsibility of classroom teachers.  The superintendent 
            will develop procedures and guidelines to provide direction for the staff.
