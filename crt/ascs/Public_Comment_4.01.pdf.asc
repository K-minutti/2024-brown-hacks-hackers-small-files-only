     Subject:           [EXTERNAL] Washoe County School District Board Resolution 20-011
     To the Members of the Board, 
     I am a local parent with one child in the Washoe County public school system. I am writing regarding Washoe County 
     School District Board Resolution 20-011. 
     Before the Board votes to approve this resolution, I want to make sure every Trustee and every community member 
     hearing this email to the Board is aware that school districts in every state in our nation are voting to adopt resolutions just 
     like this one, and that more often than not, the resolutions bring Critical Race Theory into schools. 
     Please, don’t require Washoe County teachers to participate in professional development courses which train them in 
     Critical Race Theory. Please, do not encourage our teachers to direct classroom discussions about race with Critical Race 
     Theory ideas. Please, don’t adopt curricula for our schools which instructs our children in Critical Race Theory. Please, 
     reject this resolution if it will usher in classroom instruction in the victim/oppressor narrative of Critical Race Theory.  
     Curricula that present Critical Race Theory, such as Black Lives Matter curriculum or The 1619 Project curriculum, teach 
     schoolchildren falsehoods. Students in Washoe County School District schools deserve historically accurate education 
     about the United States of America’s story. 
     Critical Race Theory claims the American Revolution was fought to preserve slavery and that America is a racist nation. 
     Our students are entitled to the truth, which is that Americans were a people born into a slaveholding world, and we 
     prayed, and fought, and died to end it. 
     The Declaration of Independence was the first crushing blow for equality in history. It proclaimed that each of us is created 
     equal and given by our Creator certain rights, just for being human. 
     That Declaration never died. It marched again when we passed the 13th Amendment forbidding slavery forever on every 
     square inch of American soil. It raged in 1871, when President Ulysses Grant fought the Ku Klux Klan, and it gloried in 
     1965 when we finally guaranteed voting rights for black Americans. 
     We are not a racist nation. We are a nation that wars against racism. Our kids need to know this. 
     Please, do not vote to pass a district-wide resolution that will subject Washoe County students to Critical Race Theory, to 
     revisionist history, to the false and damaging ideas of ‘white privilege’ and ‘systemic racism.’ 
     I know for a fact that Washoe County parents stand opposed to our schools presenting Critical Race Theory as fact to 
     children who deserve to know their true heritage.  
     I stand opposed to Washoe County School District Board Resolution 20-011 if it means the next generation will grow up 
     thinking the worst about our nation’s past and believing lies about its present.   
     Our children deserve the whole truth. 
     Thank you, 
     Mrs. Katy McPherson

     I do not see a need to resolve anything by the school district, especially if it is something that is being done in 
     California.  The state to our west falls very low on the pecking order of the 50 states educational systems, and would not 
     be one that I would want our children to emulate.  Since the Nevada State constitution follows the US constitution and the 
     13th, 14th and 15th amendments to the US Constitution already afford/guarantee equal treatment of all peoples under the 
     law, than restating this becomes redundant. I would view this resolution as an attempt to curry favor amongst one special 
     interest group, which is not the intent of the US Constitution.  "All Men (and women) are Created Equal." Let the courts 
     sort this out if sojmeone feels that they have been slighted based on race, creed, color, sex or national origin.  Nevada 
     has many differing creeds from Asia, Pacifica, Europe, Africa, South America, Central America, Native first peoples and 
     Australia.  All are viewed as equal by the law.

         Subject:                          [EXTERNAL] Board of Trustees Meeting 10/27/2020
         To whom it may concern, 
                 My name is Althea Mayberry. I graduated from Reno High School, class of 2020. I am commenting in support of 
         the proposed resolution. 
                 I recognize I will never experience racism, but in the thirteen years I have attended school in Washoe County I 
         have witnessed countless acts of racism committed by both educators and students. I find myself actively unlearning 
         biased curriculum, especially that of history and social studies classes, daily. While the teaching of the current 
                                                                                                                hite‐washed 
         curriculum is a disservice to all students, it is especially harmful to BIPOC students who are taught the w
         curriculum. The most recent example of this I can recount is of my sophomore year AP European History class, the 
         curriculum of which is full of “white savior” rhetoric, but combined with the overt, racial biases of the teacher created a 
         caustic learning environment for minority students.     While I can not speak directly to the experience of BIPOC 
         students in this school district, I am gay and have experienced firsthand the lack of support for LGBTQ+ students and the 
         lack of curriculum surrounding the community's history. I learned from a young age, too young, that I could not be 
                                                       spect of teachers and opportunities in the class, because they are often 
         openly gay in classrooms or I would risk the re
         made uncomfortable and do not know how to treat me going forward.  
                 I stand in solidarity with Washoe County Students for Change/ Diversify Our Narrative and the requests they 
         have made. The addition of inclusive and antiracist curriculum, as proposed by the resolution, must also be 
         accompanied by the rectification of the policy that prohibits teachers expressing their ally‐ship of the LGBTQ+ 
         community and support of the Black Lives Matter movement in the classroom, as this open support is non‐political and 
         helps promote inclusivity and representation within a classroom.  
         Thank you for your time, 
         Althea Mayberry
