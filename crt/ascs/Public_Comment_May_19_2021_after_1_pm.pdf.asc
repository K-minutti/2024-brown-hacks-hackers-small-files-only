              I think all the board members should be required to read the two books in question.

              All students can and should be back full-time NOW! Lack of full-time in-person return shortchanges our 
              children and violates Ed code 43504(b) which states: [schools] shall offer in-person instruction to the 
              greatest extent possible." This is unacceptable! 
              According to this: 
              https://www.cde.ca.gov/fg/aa/pa/instructionaltimetable.asp 
              Grades 9-12 have a minimum of 64,800 minutes/180 days = 360 mins/day.  
              We are currently at 265 mins/day.  
              Grades 4-8 should have a minimum of 300 mins/day.  
              We are currently at 203 mins/day. 
              PLEASE, Let us know us know what we may be missing here... 
              Parents, please send an email to KidsNeedClassrooms@gmail.com to stay up to date on the latest 
              information. Do not stay complacent just because the district is "moving in the right direction" and 
              throwing you some crumbs. Your children have a RIGHT to a quality education and they're getting 
              shafted right now. If the district cannot even do a dry run of a REAL full-time reopening now, do not 
              delude yourselves into thinking it will be successfully implemented in the fall. ⚠ꀏTHIS WAS A FAKE

                  Agenda Item:   D.2 (Discussion/Action) MBUSD Resolution 2021-14: Commitment to Re-open 
              MBUSD Schools Fully in 2021-22 
               
              Members of the board -- I am writing to ask you that when you commit re-opening schools next year, 
              you also commit to ensuring that teachers have the tools they need to do their jobs to the best of their 
              ability, in order to best serve our students.  One key tool, we have all learned this past year and a half, is 
              our online LMS, and to be quite frank: GoogleClassroom was the least effective option we could have 
              possibly used this past year.   
              I have used LMSs in my classrooms for over a decade now, and beta-tested and trained staff in LMS 
              systems in MBUSD since my first year here in 2015, so consider myself to be very adept at learning, 
              navigating, and using these programs.  GoogleClassroom cost me *countless* hours this year in 
              assignment set-up time (over an hour per block day of set-up--not including planning).  While the 
              simplicity of the format of GoogleClassroom may seem appealing, its simplicity removes many of the 
              features and needs that actually make an LMS useful and functional for secondary teachers, and often 
              makes it less user-friendly and more labor-intensive than it should be.  
               I ask that you please consider allowing teachers to use either the LMS of their choice or implementing a 
              new LMS next year for secondary teachers.

              As a working parent with two active teenagers  I was NOT given enough time to thoroughly review 4 
              new proposed books. This is unacceptable and unrealistic. However, thanks to much research I was able 
              to learn more about SLAY and I am appalled that this is what you want my child to "learn" in school. So, 
              you think it's appropriate for a 9th grade CHILD to learn of sexual relationships, detailed and r-rated 
              sexual and physical descriptions? SHAME ON YOU! This normalizes such activity between minors. I also 
              find it very inappropriate that a board member is encouraging students (again, still minors) to voice their 
              support on this.  This crosses the line and I find it not only unprofessional but unethical.  I am NOT ok 
              with an elected board member behaving in such a manner to persuade children to encourage this type 
              of reading.  It is so poorly written that It should not be called literature.  And, the biggest question is why 
              the sudden replacement of Catcher in the Rye?  Can anyone give me a non-biased answer (not opinion) 
              on this one?  As a parent I am worried about the future of MBUSD and the direction it is headed? I ask 
              that you kindly listen to parents and do the right thing!

              Mira Costa lacks diversity of students, so there’s not much exposure to other racial groups (we live in a 
              bubble). A simple and very doable solution to this problem is changing our English classes core reading. 
              Please take this into consideration of how literature, written by someone of a different color or creed, 
              will benefit the youth!

              Dear Board of Trustees,  
              I stand in firm support of the novels being proposed tonight by our outstanding English department 
              (shoutout to Ms. Sieker, the AP Lit master). I want to take this opportunity to quickly refute a point 
              being made by members of the community who oppose these novels, specifically regarding "Slay". For 
              those who believe that "Catcher in the Rye" is any more appropriate than "Slay," I would highly 
              encourage you to read "Catcher in the Rye". I understand that it might've been a while since you read it, 
              but it is not one bit more appropriate than "Slay". At this point, it seems like most of the criticisms of 
              these books are based on false or misleading information, so I'd highly encourage this board to approve 
              these proposals immediately.  
              Thanks,  
              Parth Badhwar

              Subject: Critical Race Theory  
              May/19/2021  
              I oppose the implementation of this ideology!  The word <theory= is derived from the Greek word, 
              <theoria=, to look or observe, a supposition based merely on <speculation=. Yet, we’re willing to jettison 
              most of what we know to be true, the classic works that have been the bedrock of this country, that 
              have had a profound influence on generation after generation.   For what...the cancel culture?? We have 
              now begun the process of replacing classics with new authors like <Slay=, stories filled with sexual 
              language and abuse. These <new= authors aren’t in addition to the classics, they have replaced the 
              classics, apparently by edict?   
              This reminds me of the <French Revolution=, where the <citizens= threw out all of good as well as the 
              bad, a situation they have still not recovered from!      
              Have any of you read the entirety of the CRT?? Surely there are things that aren’t true or at least 
              doubtful? This country is <not= racist!   
              Before you decide to renounce everything, we hold near and dear, before you decide to embark on the 
              indoctrination of our teachers, who will in turn, indoctrinate our children, I suggest a long pause. The 
              teachers and some parents are vulnerable to this coercion for fear of losing their jobs, friends and undue 
              influence on their children,  
              Sincerely,
