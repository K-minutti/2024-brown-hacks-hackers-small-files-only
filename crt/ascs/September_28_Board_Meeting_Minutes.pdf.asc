      Board President Baugher called the meeting back into open session at 6:00 p.m. and informed those in 
      attendance or listening in that the California Department of Public Health issued guidance on July 12, 
      2021, requiring masks be worn in K-12 school settings.  As the District regularly has students attend its 
      board meetings for various reasons, board meetings are considered a K-12 setting. Therefore, masks are 
      required to attend this Board meeting in person regardless of vaccination status, meaning whether you 
      have received a covid-19 vaccination or not, you must wear a mask in this building to attend this 
      meeting.  
       
      For those individuals who have a mask exemption recognized by CDPH, the District has face shields 
      available for your use. We also have masks available for those who arrive without masks. CDPH and mask 
      exemption information is available online and hard copies are located on the tables in the Boardroom 
      and outside in the waiting area. The District livestreams regular board meetings on YouTube in order to 
      maximize public access and participation. As you may have noticed when entering this building we have 
      set up a television outside of the building, in the open air, for those who wish to watch this meeting but 
      who cannot wear a mask or appropriate face covering indoors.  
       
      In an effort to make this meeting as accessible to the public as possible, we have comment cards available 
      and if you are unable or unwilling to wear a mask or face covering indoors and wish to address the Board 
      tonight you may submit your comments in writing and they will be read aloud during the public comment 
      portion of the meeting in accordance with our meeting bylaws. 
       
      In closing, during our last meeting, members of the public removed tape denoting blocked off seats 
      increasing capacity well beyond the 25% limit in the Boardroom.  As noted in all posted agendas, seating 
      in the Boardroom will be limited to 25% capacity with overflow seating available in the 
      auditorium.  Those unwilling to abide by this governance or any of our board meeting policies will be 
      asked to leave. 
       
     2.  Pledge to the Flag  
      The Pledge to the Flag was led by Saleen Choate, student from Col. Nichols Elementary. Saleen has been 
      a Nichols' Eagle since First Grade.  She shares her thoughts and opinions about all subjects. She is great 
      at taking risks when it comes to answering questions. Saleen’s insights about math, reading, and science 
      are fantastic. She is always extremely supportive of her fellow classmates, oftentimes saying words of 
      encouragement like, “good job” or “great answer”. Mr. Homa, her sixth-grade teacher, is honored to 
      have Saleen as a student in his class and privileged to have her be our representative. 
     3.  Report of Closed Session Action 
      Board President Baugher stated that there were no items to report from closed session. 
     4.  Public Comments  
      Board President Baugher reported that on March 17, 2020, Governor Gavin Newson issued Executive 
      Order N-29-20, which modifies some Brown Act provisions requiring physical presence of Board 
      Members or the public to attend and participate at Board meetings considering the COVID-19 pandemic. 
      The Bakersfield City School District hereby provides notice that the September 28, 2021 Board Meeting 
      will be open to the public. Seating in the Board Room will be limited to 25% capacity with social 
      distancing and face mask requirements in effect. Overflow seating will also be available in the auditorium 
      with the meeting live streamed. 
       
      Members of the public may attend the meeting to provide public comments in person.  Alternatively, 
      persons wishing to address the Board may also provide “live” public comments via zoom through 
       2   
    
      telephone or video conference in real time, by submitting an email with the subject “Request to address 
      the Board” to supt@bcsd.com or calling 661-631-4611 by 12:00 noon the day of the Board Meeting. All 
      individuals calling or submitting an email with their name, email address, phone number, and the topic 
      they wish to address, will receive a response email with the zoom link and phone number in which to 
      attend the live public comments portion of the meeting. Individuals will be placed in a zoom waiting 
      room until it is their turn to provide their comment.  Only individuals submitting a request will be 
      admitted to the zoom meeting. Individuals attending the meeting in-person for public comments will be 
      called upon first. 
       
      Members of the public may request that items be placed on the agenda of any regular Board Meeting.   
      The items must be directly related to school district business.  Items placed on the agenda by the public 
      will be for information and discussion so that the Board may be advised of the views of the community. 
      Individuals may address the Board of Education by completing the forms provided at the door and 
      submitting it to the Administrative Assistant prior to the start of the meeting.  In order to run an efficient 
      meeting, the Board is not able to take questions or comments from the floor.  
      Noelle Perez Button 
      Ms. Button stated that she understands that there are mandates with vaccines and testing. Her 
      religious exemptions have been denied by the District and she has strongly held beliefs. She would like 
      answers from the District. 
       
      Dennis McClean 
      Mr. McClean stated that he is a Grandfather of BCSD students. He understands that there are different 
      interpretations of the mask mandate throughout the county and other Districts don't have a mask 
      mandate in place. He asked the District why are we enforcing it, and he stated that he opposes the 
      mask mandate. 
       
      Mary Little 
      Ms. Little shared facts and statistics showing that the mask mandate is harmful. She stated that the 
      facts are not mattering or don’t seem to be relevant to the District. BCSD is run by fear of losing 
      money. Students are losing instruction by being sent home over and over. She encouraged the District 
      to do more research.  
       
      Judith Olsson 
      Ms. Olsson thanked the Board for giving the opt-out option, and stated that it is still not easily visible. 
      There are many issues that surround our school district and issues that our children are facing. She 
      expressed her concerns about the sexual issues that students are facing. It is unjust that children are 
      having to face issues that are adult agendas and do not concern children. 
       
      Mary Darrah 
      Ms. Darrah stated that she is a grandmother of children who are bi-racial, and she is concerned about 
      them being taught Critical Race Theory (CRT). She finds it upsetting that perhaps her grandchildren 
      would one day be told or taught that their father would be considered an oppressor because of his 
      white race. She opposes all racism. CRT rejects the idea of equal protection. It teaches children to hate 
      each other, and the school system does not have the right to teach children this. Asked that the District 
      consider character of a person and not the color of their skin. 
       3   
    
      Teresa Macias 
      Ms. Macias stated that she was at the Board Meeting to speak about the Migrant Program. She stated 
      that Deisy Galvan is delightful and knows the parents and students. She is here to ask the Board to 
      consider Deisy Galvan to be the next Migrant Coordinator for the District. 
       
      Cecilia Lopez 
      Ms. Lopez stated that she is a parent of the Migrant Program and comes to speak as a representative 
      of the RAC parent group. She is a little worried as Janie Flores has left the migrant program. She sees a 
      need for a replacement. She is asking the Board to consider their petition of Deisy Galvan as the most 
      capable person for the position because she is an empathetic person and has a powerful connection to 
      the migrant parents, and for the Spanish language. She stated that Deisy is not new and knows the 
      program, parents, and students. In a short time, she has already won the hearts of the parents, 
      students, and migrant program. Ms. Lopez comes on behalf of many parents. 
       
      Ashley De La Rosa 
      Ms. De La Rosa is the Education Policy Director for the Dolores Huerta Foundation and, she has 
      committed to ensuring that BCSD parents have access to critical services. Recently they have been 
      given the opportunity to host mobile vaccination clinics and would like to partner with BCSD.  She 
      believes that BCSD families will benefit from vaccines. 
       
      Steve Comstock (Zoom) 
      Mr. Comstock asked the Board to consider three items: Reject H.4 on the Agenda, establish a Covid 
      Relief Fund for when Covid leave expires and employees will have to use their own time, and would 
      like the Board  to add a permanent item on the agenda for the president of the unions to speak.  
       
      5. Approval of Minutes of the regular meeting on Tuesday, August 24, 2021 
      It was recommended that the minutes of the regular meeting on Tuesday, August 24, 2021 be approved. 
      Motion by Chris Cruz Boone, second by Laura Guerrero Salgado. 
      Final Resolution: Motion Carries 
      Yea: Pam Baugher, Lillian Tafoya, Laura Guerrero Salgado, Chris Cruz Boone, Shannon Zimmerman 
       
   D. Recognitions 
       
     1.  Recognition of Supervisor Leticia Perez 
      Superintendent Luque recognized and thanked Supervisor Perez for the gift of $5,000 to Martin Luther 
      King, Jr. Elementary School for the 2021-2022 school year. Supervisor Perez was not in attendance.  
       
     2.  Recognition of Lillian Tafoya for 25 Years of Dedicated Service as a School Board Member 
      Superintendent Luque presented Board Member, Lillian Tafoya, with a plaque from Kern County 
      Superintendent of Schools recognizing and celebrating the 25 years that she has served as a Board 
      Member in Kern County.  
       
     3.  Recognizing September as Latin Heritage Month 
      Superintendent Luque stated that the Bakersfield City School District recognizes the heritage of Hispanic 
      Americans in our schools and city, and encourages all students, staff, and Bakersfield City families to 
       4   
    
      deepen their understanding of the Latin community by celebrating their histories, cultures and 
      contributions. 
       
      During the Civil Rights Movement, the campaign to recognize the history, struggle, contributions, and 
      achievements of Hispanic Americans gained traction. 
      In 1968, California Congressman George E. Brown introduced House Joint Resolution 1299 to 
      commemorate the contributions of Hispanic and Latinx Americans, authorizing President Lyndon B. 
      Johnson to proclaim the week of September 15, 1968 as the first National Hispanic Heritage Week. In 
      1988, President Ronald Reagan declared September 15 through October 15 as National Hispanic 
      Heritage Month. 
       
      Hispanic Heritage Month begins on September 15th and ends on October 15th to coincide with the 
      independence dates of five Latin American countries who declared their independence from Spain in 
      1821: Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua. Hispanic Heritage Week 
      commemorates Chile’s independence from Spain on September 18, 1810, and Mexico’s independence 
      from Spain on September 16, 1821. 
       
      The Board of Trustees encourages all staff and families to visit our BCSD Cultural Heritage Guide, located 
      on our district webpage for activities and resources to honor, recognize, and celebrate the history of 
      Hispanic Heritage.  
     4.  Recognizing October as Filipino Heritage Month 
      Superintendent Luque stated that the Bakersfield City School District recognizes the heritage of Filipino 
      Americans in our community and encourages all students, staff, and Bakersfield City families to deepen 
      their understanding of the Filipino community by celebrating their history, culture and contributions. 
      Filipino Americans make up one of the largest groups of Asian Americans, with a population of more 
      than 3 million. On October 18, 1587, Filipino Americans first landed on the American continent, landing 
      at Morro Bay, California. 
       
      Filipino Americans have contributed in many ways to American history. For example, in World War II 
      many were recruited from the Central Valley to fight for the United States. For their service, these 
      veterans were honored with the Congressional Gold Medal. In the 1960’s Filipino American labor 
      organizer Larry Dulay Itilong rose to national prominence when he along with others organized the 
      Delano grape strike. 
       
      On September 9, 2009, the California State Assembly voted to designate the month of October as Filipino 
      American History Month.  
       
      The Board of Trustees encourages all staff and families to visit our BCSD Cultural Heritage Guide, located 
      on our district webpage for activities and resources to honor, recognize, and celebrate the history of 
      Filipino Americans.
