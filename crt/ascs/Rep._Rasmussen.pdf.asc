                        Dear School Board Members, 
                        Tonight, you will be deciding if the Anchorage School District should adopt “Anti-Racism” and 
                        “Instructional Equity” into the school’s curriculum. I want to ensure there is adequate public 
                        testimony allowed on these policies and that we are not acting in a knee jerk fashion to events across 
                        the country.  
                        As a mom to two small children who will be entering the Anchorage School system, I believe it is 
                        very important that age-appropriate material is presented. I also believe it is a parent’s right to be 
                        able to opt their children out from having certain material taught to them. We, as a society, have 
                        kept religion and politics out of educational curriculum. As we move forward, we need to ensure 
                        that certain ideologies regarding Critical Race Theory, if presented in schools, are presented in 
                        a balanced and age-appropriate way.  
                        Kids need to know the whole story about our country’s history. We have not always lived up to the 
                        second paragraph of the Declaration of Independences, “that all men are created equal, that they are 
                        endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights,” but we have come far, and we should be 
                        proud of that fact. 
                         
                        Sincerely,  
                         
                         
                         
                        Representative Sara Rasmussen
