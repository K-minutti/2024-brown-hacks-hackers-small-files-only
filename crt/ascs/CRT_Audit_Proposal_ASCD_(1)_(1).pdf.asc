                    For the purposes of this audit, the definition that the Heritage Foundation uses is that Critical 
                    Race Theory makes race the prism through which its proponents analyze all aspects of 
                    American life, and it reimagines the U.S as a nation split by groups, each with specific claims 
                    on victimization.

                  audit that will provide feedback on the district’s curriculum, assessments, and instructional 
                  practices. This engaging learning opportunity will center on utilizing strengths-based strategies, 
                  research-based practices, and resource tools that guide a review of rubrics, surveys, classroom 
                  visits, interviews, and document analysis aligned with the overall curriculum program review 
                  plan.  ASCD will work closely with Lakota Local School District to meet your specific needs.

                  recommended changes or improvements. The results of the curriculum program review will 
                  provide a written report of the analysis, finding and recommendations

                         CRT practices.

                 you develop a deeper understanding of your resources and their functionality. By conducting a
