            adding security cameras, perimeter fencing, emergency door locks and other life

            ^(REPAIRS) Neighborhood schools across Tucson are outdated, deteriorating and
            must be upgraded to protect student health and safety. This bond measure will
            fund critical improvement projects which include installing air conditioning and
            HVAC systems,      upgrading    plumbing   and    electrical wiring   to   increase
            water conservation and energy efficiency, replacing desks and classroom equipment,
            andmeetingcurrentstandards for handicap accessibility.
            (20 YEARS) It has been nearly 20 years since Tucson voters approved a local bond
            measure to upgrade neighborhood schools. By providing a dedicated source of
            funding to repair schools, this bond measure will allow the district to provide
            students and teachers better learning environments and access to the education
            resources needed to improve Tucson schools.

            funds be used to upgrade every school in the district. This ensures that all students
            across Tucson have equal access to clean, safe and quality schools, and improving

            healthcare, and engineering as well as traditional trades that provide stable,

            (TEACHER RETENTION) This measure will help Tucson public schools retain and
            attract quality teachers.  By upgrading and building new classrooms, the best
            teachers will want to teach in our community because classrooms will be safer,

            (ACCOUNTABILITY) Tucson Unified has a strong record of fiscal accountability,
            which includes a community oversight committee that reviews bond measure
            projects and spending. Furthermore, this bond requires independent annual audits
            to ensure transparency, and public expenditure reports so we can hold
            school officials accountable and make sure they are using our tax dollars effectively
            andaspromised.

     Statements from TUSD Bond Measure Opponents
                   (Ranked by Percentage Saying <Strongly Agree= with the Statement)
            (TAXES) With inflation and rising prices for gas, food and housing it is harder than
            ever for working families, small businesses and seniors on fixed incomes to make
            endsmeet. We cannotafford a bond measure that will raise local property taxes for
            years to come.
            *(WOKE SCHOOLS) Tucson teachers, school board members and bureaucrats are
            trying to indoctrinate our kids with a radical, woke agenda. They refuse to listen to
            parents, and instead use the classroom to teach Critical Race Theory and expose
            students to offensive material about gender and sexuality in schools. We should not
            reward themwithmoreofourtaxdollars.
            (WASTE) During the pandemic Tucson Unified received hundreds of millions of
            dollars in additional funding, and now wants us to approve the biggest school bond
            measure in Arizona history.    We must vote NO on this half-billion-dollar bond;
            politicians and school administrators can9t be trusted because they waste our
            money, and reward themselves with outrageous executive salaries and
            taxpayer-funded pensions.
            *(DESEG) Local homeowners already pay a special Tucson Unified school
            desegregation property tax that raises millions of dollars every year. School district
            officials already have the funding they need and should not try to raise our taxes
            evenhigher.

                                  Conclusions
  " The survey finds voters concerned about local schools, as pluralities currently disapprove of
    the job performance of the district overall and Tucson USD public schools.
  " Specifically, voters identify a shortage of qualified teachers, a lack of state funding for public
    schools and the overall quality of education in TUSD schools as major problems 3 greater or
    equal to their level of concern about <inflation and raising prices=.
  " There is also a consensus that TUSD needs additional funding to meet the educational needs
    of local students and improve school safety.
  " Voters9 mindset and perceptions set a strong foundation for a potential TUSD bond measure:
     " More than six in ten favor a $480 TUSD bond measure 3 Democrats, liberals and white
       voters are the most likely to be supportive, majorities of Independents and Latinos would
       vote <yes,= and voters of all ages support the bond.
  " Support increases and intensifies following a plain language summary of how bond measure
    funds would be used 3 voters9 top priorities include repairing deteriorating classrooms,
    upgrading air conditioning, making safety improvements and investing in equipment and
    technology to enhance STEM programsandclassroomeducation.
  " In simulating a community education program, voters respond strongly to themes focused
    onSTEMeducation,studentsafetyandmakinghealthandsafetyrepairstoschools.
  " In sum, these survey results suggest Tucson USD voters regard a local school bond measure
    as warranted and appropriate and are prepared to approve such a measure if placed on the
    ballot.
