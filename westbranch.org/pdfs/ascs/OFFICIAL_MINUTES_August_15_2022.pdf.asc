           OTHER ITEMS FOR ANNOUNCEMENT / DISCUSSION 
              
             1.       Mr. Smeal was approached by a community member concerning the removal of the tennis courts years ago and the 
                      possibility of bringing them back.  Mr. Smeal asked that the Board consider looking into this in the future.  Mrs. 
                      Dutrow cautioned that tennis has a fall season which would need to be a point of consideration.  Mr. Parks added 
                      that years ago, the courts were used for both Physical Education and Tennis Club.  Mr. Yontosh stated that past 
                      Boards voted out the tennis courts and the funds were moved to the General Fund at the time.  Mrs. Dutrow stated 
                      that after a certain amount of time passes, a transfer of funds is permitted in these circumstances.  In addition, Mr. 
                      Smeal noted that previous Boards promised to rebuild the tennis courts at the time of demolition.
