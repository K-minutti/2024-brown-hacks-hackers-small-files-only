                                                                             WBVA STUDENT EXPECTATIONS 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
                              Students who wish to be successful online learners must be organized, self-motivated, and willing to 
                              assume responsibility for academic success. In order to achieve success in WBVA courses, students 
                              are required to meet the expectations listed below. Failure to meet these expectations will result in 
                              removal from the WBVA: 
                                      ●  Complete a minimum of two (2) assignments for each day that school is in session in a given 
                                             week. These two complete assignments allow the school district to mark the student as 
                                             <present= in school for the day. NOTE that two assignments per day is NOT enough to 
                                             complete courses on time, and serves only as a means of recording attendance. Please see the 
                                             full WBVA Attendance Policy (page 5) for full details regarding attendance requirements.  
                                      ●  Sign-in to the school office, in accordance with district policies and procedures, for any visits 
                                             to the school during regular school hours. In addition, WBVA students must adhere to the 
                                             student dress code for any visits to the school (see Student Handbooks). 
                                      ●  Login to the Educere site daily to receive instructor communications, messages, and other 
                                             important updates. Students are required to login each day that school is in session at West 
                                             Branch (see school calendar). 
                                      ●  Maintain  regular  contact  with  teachers.  Students  MUST  respond  to  email  and  phone 
                                             communications from teachers and advisors.  
                                              
                                      ●  Make use of supports such as the <instant teacher= feature in the Educere program. Many 
                                             supports are in place to help students succeed and should be utilized as needed. 
                                      ●  Complete and submit work independently. Policies and procedures targeting cheating and/or 
                                             plagiarism as outlined in the Student Handbooks will be enforced for WBVA students. Any 
                                             student caught cheating or plagiarizing another’s work can be dismissed from WBVA.  
                                              
                                      ●  Complete all coursework within the specified enrollment time. Course extensions are not 
                                             offered for coursework except in the case of medical emergencies.  
                                              
                                              
                                      ●  Request additional support from a West Branch teacher from the WBVA coordinator. Timely 
                                             requests for help will help to ensure your academic success. Students should not wait until 
                                             failing  grades are earned to request additional assistance. Arrangements for support or 
                                             tutoring from a faculty member must be made in advance by consulting with the academy 
                                             coordinator. Students may not interrupt a teacher who is teaching a class for the purpose of 
                                             receiving tutoring.  
                                              
                                                                                                                                                                               5 
                              ●  Students will be expected to meet with Mr. Caldwell, WBVA coordinator once a month, in 
                                    person to go over progress.  This will be a group meeting, where students will individually go 
                                    over academics.  Failure to comply with this expectation may result in dismissal from WBVA.  
                                    This will also be counted as an unexcused absence.

                        Whether in a traditional classroom or the online learning environment, attendance is an important 
                        predictor of a student’s academic success. The non-traditional format of online learning requires 
                        unique guidelines and policies. Please note the following policies regarding attendance for WBVA 
                        students: 
                              ●  Attendance weeks will run from Monday through Sunday of each week. Therefore, students 
                                    will have seven days, including weekends, to complete required assignments for a given 
                                    week.  
                                     
                              ●  Attendance will be documented according to assignment completion with two (2) complete 
                                    assignments equaling one (1) day of school attendance. NOTE: Two assignments per day is a 
                                    MINIMUM expectation for attendance purposes only and does not ensure on-time completion 
                                    of a course. It is up to the student to ensure that s/he is on pace in all classes. This will mean 
                                    completing more than the minimum number of required assignments in a given week.  
                                     
                              ●  Students and parents/guardians will be notified of attendance compliance on the first school 
                                    day of each week. Typically, this will be Monday. Parents/Guardians will then have three (3) 
                                    days  to  submit  an  excuse  to  Mrs.  Kim  Eboch  in  the  Attendance  Office  at 
                                    keboch@westbranch.org.  
                              ●  All WBVA students are expected to log on to the Educere site every day that school is in 
                                    session at West Branch (see attached school calendar).  
                              ●  All excuses will be coded as illegal or unexcused until an excuse is submitted to the attendance 
                                    office.  
                              ●  After three illegal absences, a parent meeting plan is required and a truancy elimination plan 
                                    will be created.  Any illegal absence after the parent meeting will result in legal action. 
                                     
                              ●  Accumulated absences in excess of 10 days (excused or unexcused) will require a doctor’s 
                                    note.  Failure to provide a doctor’s note after 10 days may result in dismissal from the 
                                    program. 
                              ●  Computer  and/or  internet  accessibility  problems  are  unexcused  absences.  It  is  the 
                                    responsibility of the parents/guardians to ensure the availability of a working computer and 
                                    reliable internet access. 
                                     
                              ●  Technical issues preventing a student from completing work should be reported to the WBVA 
                                    Coordinator immediately for resolution.  
                                                                                   6 
             
              ●  Online courses are available 24 hours a day, seven days a week. Students may log in and 
                 complete lessons at any time during a 24 hour period to document attendance. Students may 
                 also complete assignments on holidays and weekends. 
                  
                                                 
                                  WBVA GRADING POLICY 
                                                                                    
            All WBVA online courses are graded on a semester basis. Students are expected to complete all 
            courses within the confines of the WBASD school calendar.  
              ●  Any assignments not completed by the end of the semester will receive a grade of zero.  
              ●  WBVA grades will be averaged with previous grades from any institution to determine final 
                 grades for courses.  
              ●  It  is  the  responsibility  of  the  student  and  parent  to  monitor  academic  progress 
                 throughout the school year. Progress can be checked daily by logging into the Educere site 
                 and visiting the student’s home page.  
              ●  Regular  progress  toward  graduation  requirements  is  expected  of  all  WBVA  students. 
                 Continuation in the full-time WBVA program will be evaluated on a yearly basis. Repeated 
                 failure of courses can result in being dismissed from the academy.  
                  
            PROMOTION AND RETENTION 
             
            All  WBVA students are expected to demonstrate regular academic progress toward graduation. 
            Failure to do so may result in dismissal from the academy.  If a student is failing a class at the end of 
            the quarter, they may be dismissed from WBVA.  WBVA students will be held to the same policies for 
            promotion and retention as traditional West Branch students. The policy is provided here: 
                  st th
              ●  1  - 8  Grade: Students will be retained for failure of two major subjects or one major subject

                      WBVA STUDENT HEALTH RECORDS POLICY                      
           Students enrolled in the WBVA are required to undergo regular health screenings, receive or update 
           immunizations, and maintain a school health record in accordance with the regulations set forth by 
           the Pennsylvania Department of Health and Education. Every student, in every grade, must undergo 
           a height, weight, Body Mass Index (BMI), and vision screening for each year enrolled in public school. 
           These screenings are provided free of cost by the WBASD Health Office staff. Arrangements for yearly 
           screenings can be made through the academy coordinator. In addition, the following health services 
           are required by grade level: 
                 th
             ●  6  Grade: Medical Exam and Scoliosis Screening 
                 th
             ●  7  Grade: Hearing Test, Scoliosis Screening, and Dental Exam 
                  th
             ●  11  Grade: Medical Exam and Hearing Test 
           These services can also be provided by WBASD Health Office staff at no cost, or the student can choose 
           to have the services provided by his/her regular physician or dentist. If the student chooses to see a 
           private provider for these services, written documentation of the screening results must be provided 
           to the Health Office (forms can be obtained from the academy coordinator or the Health Office). 
           Should a WBVA student fall out of compliance with regulations, he or she will be notified by the 
           Health Office. Failure to comply with required screenings can result in dismissal from the academy.  
            
            
                           WBVA STANDARDIZED TESTING                          
           All students are required, by law, to participate in PSSA testing in grades 3, 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8. In addition, 
           all students enrolled in Algebra IB, Biology, or English 10 are required to participate in the Keystone 
           Exam  at  the  end  of  the  appropriate  course.  WBVA  students  and  their  parents/guardians  are 
           responsible for ensuring that they report to the school for testing on designated day. The WBVA 
           coordinator will supply students with a testing calendar as needed.  Refusal to participate in state 
           testing may result in dismissal from WBVA. 
            
           Please Note: WBVA students are welcome to participate in various standardized tests administered 
           throughout the year, including the ASVAB, PSAT, and SAT. Please discuss these options with the 
           academy coordinator if you are interested in participating.

                 The West Branch Area School District provides a special education program in accordance with 
                 federal and state regulations and guidelines to ensure the provision of a free and appropriate public 
                 education (FAPE) to all school-age children in need of such services. 
                  
                 Special education services are available to students who have been identified by an Individualized 
                 Education Program (IEP) team, based on the recommendations of a multi-disciplinary evaluation. 
                 Special education services are provided in according to the primary educational needs of the child. 
                 Support is provided for those who needed assistance with the acquisition of academic skills. Related 
                 services are available to the child to enhance participation or access to an educational program. 
                 Examples of related services include speech and language therapy, occupational therapy, etc. Special 
                 education services are provided to all WBVA students who qualify under Chapter 14 regulations. For 
                 further assistance with special education services, please contact the academy coordinator or the 
                 district Supervisor of Special Education.             
                                                                       
                                 WBVA EXTRA-CURRICULAR OPPORTUNTIES                                                      
                 WBVA students are permitted and encouraged to participate fully in all WBMS/WBHS activities, 
                 including athletics, music programs, school-sponsored clubs, and other school activities. School 
                 activities include, but are not limited to: Prom, Graduation ceremonies, school dances, and school 
                 sponsored trips. All students who participate in extra-curricular activities are held to the same 
                 standards  for  academic  performance  and  behavior  as  WBMS/WBHS  students  (see  Student 
                 Handbooks for details).  
                  
                 ATHLETIC ELIGIBILITY 
                 WBVA students enjoy full participation rights in all WBMS/WBHS athletic teams. For the purposes 
                 of academic athletic eligibility, the following policy will be strictly adhered to: 
                     ●  Students must not be failing more than two WBVA courses for the semester. 
                             o  Failing can be defined by either of the following: 
                                     ▪  A failing current grade in any currently enrolled course. 
                                     ▪  Failure to stay on pace in two or more courses. Students are expected to be 
                                         on pace in all online courses in order to be determined athletically eligible. 
                                         Falling behind pace in a course is the same as being absent from school from

                              The West Branch Area School District is pleased to provide you with the opportunity to enroll in the 
                              West Branch Virtual Academy (WBVA). To complete your enrollment in the academy, please bring

                              With your signature, you indicate that you have read and understand the policies and procedures 
                              outlined in the WBVA Student Handbook and agree to comply with stated procedures. These policies 
                              include, but are not limited to: 
                                      ✔  WBVA Attendance Policy 
                                      ✔  WBVA Student Expectations

                              Failure to comply with the guidelines of either the WBVA Student Handbook or the West Branch 
                              Student Handbooks can result in dismissal from the virtual academy or disciplinary consequences.  
                               
                              The student and parent assume full responsibility for the decision to enroll in the WBVA and are 
                              prepared for the significant time commitment required to be successful in the online learning 
                              environment. Should the student desire to leave the academy, return to West Branch High School will 
                              preferably occur at the beginning of a semester and at the discretion of the building principal and 
                              academy coordinator. Additionally, grades earned while enrolled in the WBVA will become part of 
                              the student’s permanent academic record. 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
                               
                              I have read and understand the policies and procedures outlined in the West Branch Virtual Academy 
                              Student Handbook. I officially enroll in the WBVA and am prepared to invest the time and attention 
                              necessary to be successful in the academy. I agree to all policies specified in the WBVA handbook

                              The following tips are designed to help you make a successful transition to the online learning 
                              environment: 
                                      ●  Schedule the same time every day to work on your course assignments. Treat your <school 
                                             time < as a regular, required appointment in your day. In general, students need to plan about 
                                             5 hours of study time per week for each full credit course. 
                                              
                                      ●  Work at a regular pace each week. Try not to get behind as work will only <pile up,= requiring 
                                             you to invest additional hours the next week. This creates a cycle that is difficult to break. 
                                              
                                      ●  Check your progress DAILY.  
                                      ●  Make sure that your subject teacher and the WBVA coordinator have a current email address 
                                             and your parent’s/guardian’s email address for communication purposes. 
                                      ●  Create a work space designated for school work and an organizational system to track 
                                             assignments. 
                                      ●  Make a list of questions you want to ask before you contact your subject teacher.  
                                              
                                      ●  Make use of helpful features that are already embedded in online courses. For examples, 
                                             retakes of quizzes and tests are typically permitted at least once. Don’t settle for a failing or 
                                             low grade!  
                                      ●  Ask for help as soon as you recognize the need! You are in the unique position as a WBVA 
                                             student  to  have  both  your  subject  teachers  at  Educere  and  teachers  at  WB  as  helpful 
                                             resources – use them!
