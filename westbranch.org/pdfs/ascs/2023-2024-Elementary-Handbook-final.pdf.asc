                     WELCOME to the 2023-2024 School Year! 
                                 
       
      We are so happy to have you here at West Branch Area Elementary School.  We are looking forward to a 
      safe and successful year!  With the cooperation of students, parents, and staff, we will develop a 
      community of successful learners with high standards for academics, behavior, and personal growth.  
       
      To achieve these standards, we will abide by our Positive Behavior Intervention Support System rules: Be 
      Safe, Be Respectful, and Be Ready. Students will be recognized for outstanding behavior in these areas. 
      Please take a moment to review this handbook carefully so that our school year goes smoothly for our 
      community of learners and their families. Don9t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions about the 
      information herein. 
       
      As the principal, I commit to a strong, shared communication between parents, teachers, administrators, 
      and students. I encourage students and families to attend our many activities and events throughout the 
      school year so we can get to know you better! 
       
      I look forward to an amazing year of learning with you and your child!

                                                                    INFOSNAP 
                                                                            
         The West Branch Area School District useshas moved to a paperless student registration/form system. The district utilizes 
         the InfoSnap management system.  Please locate the InfoSnap link on the district website at http://www.westbranch.org to 
         complete and sign the necessary documents.  Some of the documents included but not limited to: the student and parent 
         handbook signature page, the emergency contact form from the nurse, the internet acceptable use policy, the 
         educational trip form, and the field trip permission form.  Failure to complete the forms may result in the denial of 
         student privileges – i.e. field trips, monthly rewards, etc. 
          
                                                      STUDENT DROP-OFF/PICK-UP 
          
         If you drop your child off for school in the morning (instead of having your child ride the bus to school), you must do the 
         following: 
                   
                  DROPPING OFF BEFORE 8:55 a.m. 
          
                           You must drop your child off at the back door of the elementary school.  Go to the far end of the 
                           high school, go between the school and football field, and go behind the school.  The back door is 
                           at the gate (where the parking lot narrows to a two-lane road.)  You cannot drive through the  
                           playground to access the back of the school – you must enter through the far end of the school. 
                           If you drop off your child before the buses unload, your child must go to the cafeteria until students are 
                           released to their classrooms. 
          
                  Early Drop-Off for Work Related Issues 
          
                           If you have work commitments and need to drop your child off earlier than 8:15AM, you must have 
                           written documentation from your employer and submit it to the building principal.  The earliest that 
                           students can be dropped off is 7:45AM with said documentation.   
          
          
                  DROPPING OFF AFTER 8:55 a.m. 
          
                           You must drop your child off at the front of the elementary building.  If your child is dropped off after  
                           8:55, he/she will not be able to go to breakfast – all students going to breakfast must report to  
                           homeroom and be in the cafeteria by 8:55 a.m.   
          
                           NOTE:  If you drop your child off after 9:00 a.m. your child will be considered late, and MUST have an 
                                        excuse.  If your child does not have an excuse, your child will be considered Tardy (Late) 
                                        Unexcused.  If your child does have an excuse, your child will be considered Tardy Excused. 
                                        (See Late/Tardy Policy under Attendance) 
           
          
                                                              STUDENT PICK-UP 
          
         If you will be picking your child up after school (instead of having your child ride the bus home), you must do the 
         following: 
                           1.  Send a note to school with your child stating that you will be picking up your child after school. 
                               (Your child must give this note to his/her classroom teacher.) 
                                                                       OR 
                                                                        
                                  Write your child9s name on the Parent Pick-up List by 3:00 pm – on the building next to the door. 
                                                                                                                                        8 
               2.  Parent pick-up is located at the front of the building.  Please park in any open spot in the front of the 
                 school.  Please do not arrive prior to 3:10 PM. 
               3.  When the students are brought to the front door at approx. 3:25pm, they must be met at the door by 
                 the pick-up person before being released. Parents need to be under the portico, in eye-sight of the 
                 school staff. 
      
          NOTE:  If you do not sign your child out, or send a note stating that your child is being picked up for that day,  
                       your child will be sent home on the bus.  Your cooperation in this matter will be greatly appreciated.   
      
     REMINDER:  Students picked up early more than three times between 2:55 p.m. and 3:25 p.m. without an excusable 
     reason will be marked absent for one-half day. (See Early Dismissal Policy under Attendance) 
      
                                           
                   PARENT LETTERS FROM TEACHERS/ADMINISTRATION 
      
     Many times, throughout the school year memos and letters are sent home to parents to keep you informed of events and 
     schedules with dates and times.  Please make a habit of checking your child’s backpack each day.  This will ensure 
     your awareness of any and all events that take place throughout the year. 
      
     Please be sure to complete the InfoSnap information in its entirety. This will help prevent delays in getting your child 
     home or to a doctor if the need should arise. If you should have a change of address or phone number, please notify 
     the school office as soon as possible. We know you would want to be informed immediately if your child should need 
     medical attention. 
      
                                      VISITORS 
      
     Parents are cordially invited to visit the school at any time. Upon arriving at school please ring the buzzer and state your 
     name and reason for admittance to the building.  Upon entering the school, please report directly to the elementary office 
     to scan in. You will need your driver9s license upon entering for scanning purposes. Students are only released from the 
     building through the office. Anyone having business in the building will be given a visitor9s pass that must be visible at all 
     times.  Upon leaving the building, the visitor must scan out in the elementary office.  Appointments to see specific 
     teachers must be made in advance and scheduled during non-instructional times.  If you would like to volunteer and/or 
     visit your student during lunch, you must have current clearances on file in the district office.  Forms to apply for 
     clearances are available in the Superintendent9s office.  Failure to complete InfoSnap forms may result in being unable to 
     volunteer within the school, eat lunch with your child, or attend field trips.  
                                           
                STUDENT/ITEM PICK-UP & DROP-OFF DURING SCHOOL HOURS 
      
     As part of increased school safety efforts, before entering the office waiting area, you will be asked to state the nature of 
     your visit (student pick-up, drop-off, item drop-off, etc.).  Upon being granted entry into the waiting area, you will scan 
     your license and sign the appropriate form (time in/out, reason, etc.). For student pick-up, we will bring the student to 
     meet you in the waiting area. If you are dropping off an item (backpack, lunch items, instruments, etc.), you will fill out 
     the appropriate form, and we will be sure to get the item to the appropriate person.  
                                    TEXTBOOKS 
      
     All basic textbooks are loaned to the students for their use during the school year and are to be kept clean and handled 
     carefully.  Textbooks must be covered if required by the classroom teacher.   Any student losing or damaging a textbook 
     will be required to reimburse the school district the amount of the replacement cost.   
      
                                   LIBRARY BOOKS 
      
     In order for all students to have access to library books, it is important that students return library book on their due dates.  
     Please make sure to check the Specials schedule for Library, and make sure your child brings his/her books on Library days. 
                                           
                                                                            9 
                                                                        
                                                                        
                                                         SCHOOL CLOSINGS 
          
         Should it become necessary to close school (due to weather, power outage, etc.), an announcement will be made on the 
         local radio and television stations and via Parent Square.  The Parent Square phone system will also be used to contact 
         parents for two (2) hour delays and early dismissal announcements.  Please do not call the school or the radio/TV stations.  
         The following stations should be broadcasting any delay or cancellation information:  WPSU, Fox 8 WWCP, ABC 23 
         WATM, WTAJ, WJAC, and WOKW 102.9 FM. In addition, please check the school district9s website and Facebook 
         page. 
          
         West Branch parents are encouraged to provide cell phone information as texts have the quickest delivery time when 
         messages are sent.  Currently, if you are able to login to the PowerSchool website, you have the ability to change your 
         contact information.  This will allow you to select your preferred method of contact.    
                                            FLEXIBLE INSTRUCTIONAL DAYS (FID) 
          
         During the 2023-2024 School Year, West Branch Area School District will be utilizing Flexible Instruction Days (FIDs), 
         which may be used in place of a school day that would be canceled because of inclement weather or another emergency 
         situation. On a FID, students will complete learning activities and assignments provided by their teachers. Implementing a 
         FID will not require additional make-up days when school is canceled. The District can use up to five (5) FIDs per school 
         year. Students and parents/guardians will be informed of a FID through the District's notification systems in the same way 
         that school closings and delays are currently announced.  
          
         What will be expected of my child during a FID (grades 3-12)? 
         Students in grades 3 through 12 will download offline FID lessons to their device prior to the FID day.  Students with 
         internet may log on to Google Classroom to access assignment information.  Students are expected to complete all lessons 
         during the FID day. Students will submit/return their assignments upon their return to school the next day.  Any student 
         who fails to complete their FID assignments on their FID day, will be marked as absent unexcused from school and will 
         receive a zero on any graded assignment that was not submitted. 
          
         What will be expected of my child during a FID (grades PreK-2)? 
         Elementary students will work on FID lessons unique to their grade level. Students will receive a FID folder with 5 
         lessons. Students are expected to complete all lessons during the FID day. Students will submit/return their assignments 
         upon their return to school the next day. Any student who fails to complete their FID assignments on their FID day, will 
         be marked as absent unexcused from school and will receive a zero on any graded assignment that was not submitted. 
          
         How does student attendance work? 
         Student attendance will be determined by verification and completion of the FID lesson and/or assignment. Students 
         should not report to school on a FID. 
          
         How can I contact a teacher or staff member during a FID? 
         All teachers and professional staff members will be available via email during a FID. This includes special area teachers 
         such as music, art, library, physical education, learning support, teachers in specialized programs, reading specialists, and 
         school counselors, nurses, social workers, speech therapists, interventionists, and principals, unless the individual is ill 
         that day. 
          
         What if my child needs help with a lesson/assignment on a FID, will teachers be available to answer questions? 
         Yes, all school-based staff members will be available to answer questions on a FID via email during the hours below. The 
         student technology help desk will also be available. 
          
                     o   High School-8:00 a.m. to 2:45 p.m.  
                     o   Middle School-8:00 a.m. to 2:45 p.m.  
                     o   Elementary School-9:00 a.m. to 3:45 p.m. 
                          
                                                                                                                               10 
                            
         My child has an IEP, will his/her lesson be modified appropriately? 
         The FID lesson will be designed for students with special needs utilizing their program modifications, specially designed 
         instruction and supplementary aids and services identified in their individualized education plans. Upon return from a 
         FID, teachers of students with special needs will meet with their students to review work submitted, checking for 
         completion and understanding. Any related services (Physical Therapy, Occupational Therapy, Speech, etc.) scheduled 
         during the FID will be rescheduled according to the frequency requirements of the students9 individualized education 
         plan. 
          
         Will after school activities be canceled on a FID? 
         After school activities may be cancelled based on the nature of the event that led to the FID day.

                             THREAT ASSSESSMENT TEAM 
      
     The West Branch Area School District has a Threat Assessment Team. The team includes the Safe School 
     Safety Security Coordinator, Building Principals, Building Counselors, School Police, and Special Education 
     Supervisor.  
      
     A Threat Assessment Team is <a multidisciplinary group of individuals identified by a chief school 
     administrator responsible for the assessment of and intervention with students whose behavior may indicate a 
     threat to the safety of the student, other students, school employees, school facilities, the community, or others.=  
      
      
                        BULLYING/CYBERBULLYING/HARASSMENT 
      
      The West Branch Area School District Board of School Directors is committed to providing all students with a safe, 
      healthy, and civil school environment in which all members of the school community are treated with mutual respect, 
      tolerance, and dignity. To that end, the school district has in place policies, and practices that are designed to reduce and 
      eliminate bullying and harassment when they occur. The West Branch Elementary School has adopted the Olweus 
      Bullying Prevention Model. 
       
      This policy is in effect while students are on property within the jurisdiction of the school district; while on school-
      contracted or school-operated vehicles; and while attending or engaged in school-sponsored activities. Students who file 
      a bullying complaint or who have assisted or participated in any manner in a bullying investigation may not be retaliated 
      against.  
       
      Any violation of this policy shall be considered an infraction of the Code of Conduct, with discipline implemented 
      accordingly. All bullying behavior that is a violation of the PA Crimes Code will be reported to the appropriate legal 
      authorities. 
       
      The Board encourages students who have been bullied to promptly report such incidents to the building principal or 
      designee. 
       
      Bullying shall mean an intentional electronic, written, verbal or physical act, or series of acts: 
       
      1.  Directed at another student or students. 
      2.  Which occurs in a school setting. 
      3.  That is severe, persistent, or pervasive. 
      4.  That has the effect of doing any of the following: 
        a.  Substantially interfering with a student9s education. 
        b.  Creating a threatening environment. 
        c.  Substantially disrupting the orderly operation of the school. 
              
      School setting shall mean in the school, on school grounds, in school vehicles, at a designated bus stop, or at any 
      activity sponsored, supervised, or sanctioned by the school.  
       
      Bullying, as defined in this policy, includes cyberbullying. 
       
      The Superintendent or designee shall develop administrative regulations to implement this policy. 
      This policy shall be implemented through the cooperative efforts of the Superintendent, building administrators, school 
      staff members, parents/guardians, regional police and state police, and the school district9s community.  
       
      Each staff member shall be responsible for maintaining an educational environment free from bullying. Staff members 
                                                                          12 
      who observe or become aware of an act of bullying shall take immediate, appropriate steps to intervene unless the 
      intervention would be a threat to staff members9 safety. In that case, or if the bullying persists, s/he shall report the 
      bullying to the school principal for further investigation. This investigation may include interviews with students, 
      parents/guardians, and school staff; review of school records; and any other appropriate means of investigation. 
       
      The Board expects that students and parents/guardians who become aware of an act of bullying shall report it to a school 
      official (usually the building principal) for further investigation. Any student who retaliates against another person for 
      reporting bullying, intimidation and/or physical assault shall be subject to further disciplinary action.  
       
      Students shall be informed about the policy on the district9s publicly accessible Internet web site and in every classroom. 
      The policy shall be posted at a prominent location within each school building where such notices are usually posted. 
      Each school building principal shall ensure that the policy and procedures for reporting bullying incidents are reviewed 
      with students at least once each school year. 
       
      The Superintendent or designee, in cooperation with other appropriate administrators, shall review this policy every 
      three (3) years and recommend necessary revisions to the Board. 
       
      District administration shall annually provide the following information with the Safe School Report: 
      1.  Board9s Bullying Policy. 
      2.  Report of bullying incidents. 
      3.  Information on the development and implementation of any bullying prevention, intervention, or education 
        programs. 
       
      The Code of Student Conduct, which shall contain this policy, shall be disseminated annually to students. 
      This policy shall be accessible in every classroom. The policy shall be posted in a prominent location within each school 
      building and on the district website, if available. 
       
      Preventive Measures 
       
      A copy of this policy will be included in the student handbooks annually. Teachers, counselors, specialists, and school 
      administrators will routinely discuss bullying with students and will provide appropriate examples to assist students with 
      recognizing, identifying, and reporting bullying incidents. All students shall be informed that bullying will not be 
      tolerated in any form. All students shall be encouraged to report any bullying regardless of whether they are the victim 
      or an observer. 
       
      When an investigation substantiates that bullying has occurred, the building principal or assistant principal shall inform 
      staff who work with the offending student and the victim about the bullying so that those staff can more closely monitor 
      for future incidents of bullying. The primary purpose of such action is to protect the victim and deter such behavior in 
      the future. The disciplinary action imposed on the offender will match the severity of the offense. 
       
                           DISCRIMINATORY HARRASSMENT 
       
      Harassment by students, employees or third parties on the basis of race, color, age, creed, religion, sex, sexual 
      orientation, ancestry, national origin, marital status, pregnancy, handicap/disability or for participation in reports or 
      investigations of alleged discrimination is a form of discrimination and is subject to this policy. A person who is not 
      necessarily an intended victim or target of such harassment but is adversely affected by the offensive conduct may file a 
      report of discrimination on his/her own behalf. 
        
      For purposes of this policy, harassment shall consist of unwelcome conduct such as graphic, written, electronic, verbal 
      or nonverbal acts including offensive jokes, slurs, epithets and name-calling, ridicule or mockery, insults or put-downs, 
      offensive objects or pictures, physical assaults or threats, intimidation, or other conduct that may be harmful or 
      humiliating or interfere with a person9s school or school-related performance and which relates to an individual9s or 
      group9s race, color, age, creed, religion, sex, sexual orientation, ancestry, national origin, marital status, pregnancy or 
      handicap/disability when such conduct is: 
                                                                         13 
        1.  Sufficiently severe, persistent or pervasive; and 
           
        2.  A reasonable person in the complainant9s position would find that it creates an intimidating, threatening or 
         abusive educational environment such that it deprives or adversely interferes with or limits an individual or 
         group of the ability to participate in or benefit from the services, activities or opportunities offered by a 
         school. 
      
      
     Reporting Procedures 
      
     All students who believe they have been the victim of bullying shall promptly report the bullying incident to a teacher, 
     counselor, or building administrator. 
      
     All parents/guardians are encouraged to report the bullying incident(s) to a building administrator. 
      
     Any teacher/counselor who witnesses bullying or receives a report of bullying shall document such incident and 
     promptly investigate the matter. After the investigation has been completed, the building principal shall take appropriate 
     actions consistent with this policy. 
      
     Disciplinary and Other Action 
      
     A student who violates this policy shall be subject to appropriate disciplinary action consistent with the Code of Student 
     Conduct, which may include: 
      
     1.  Counseling within the school. 
     2.  Parental conference. 
     3.  Loss of school privileges. 
     4.  Exclusion from school-sponsored activities. 
     5.  Detention. 
     6.  Suspension. 
     7.  Expulsion. 
     8.  Board Hearing 
     9.  Referral to law enforcement officials. 
      
     If an investigation substantiates that bullying has occurred, a written record of the incident shall be placed in the file of 
     the offending student(s). Parents/Guardians of the offending students will be encouraged to attend one (1) or more 
     conferences with an administrator to review the bullying behavior and cooperative strategies for correcting it. The 
     building principal or designee shall also inform the victim9s parents/guardians of any and all bullying incidents 
     involving their child. 
      
     Disciplinary action shall be in accordance with the Board approved Code of Student Conduct depending on the severity 
     of the offense. If the investigation has determined that the conduct rises to the level of a crime, disciplinary action may 
     also include referral to law enforcement officials.  
      
     All incidents of confirmed bullying shall be recorded in writing and placed in the offending student9s discipline file. 
      
     The penalties and prohibitions in this policy are in addition to, and do not replace or supersede, any related provisions in 
     district policy prohibiting conduct such as harassment, violence, assault, and hazing.

                       OLWEUS BULLYING PREVENTION PROGRAM 
        
      Our elementary school uses the research-based Olweus Bullying Prevention Program as the foundation for 
      creating a safe environment for children. Olweus teaches that bullying is when someone repeatedly and on 
      purpose says or does mean or hurtful things to another person who has a hard time defending himself or 
      herself. 
       
      This program provides a structured approach to the prevention of bullying. It promotes increased 
      understanding of the issues involved with <bullying= behaviors and provides a coordinated plan for addressing 
      these issues. It also includes strategies for bystanders to use when they observe bullying behaviors. The goals 
      of the program are: 
       
        ●  To reduce (and ideally eliminate) and prevent problems among children 
        ●  To prevent the development of new problems 
        ●  To achieve better peer relations at school 
      There are four essential rules that we teach: 
       
      We will: 
      1. Not bully others 
      2. Help students who are bullied 
      3. Include all students who are left out 
      4. Tell an adult at school and home when someone is bullied 
       
      Every spring, students in third through sixth grade will be surveyed about bullying events that have occurred 
      during the school year. This data will help us to better address bullying within our school. If you would like to 
      opt your child out of this survey, please contact the Elementary Office.   
       
                                     Safe2Say 
       
      Safe2Say Something is a youth violence prevention program run by the PA Office of the Attorney General.  The program 
      teaches youth and adults how to recognize the warning signs and signals, especially within social media, from individuals 
      who may be a threat to themselves or others and to say something before it is too late.  With Safe2Say Something, it is 
      easy and confidential to report safety concerns to help prevent violence and tragedies.  Submit an anonymous tip report 
      through the Safe2Something system via the phone application (Safe2Say Something PA) or at the tip line number: 1-844-

                             PUPIL PROGRESS REPORTS 
      
     In order to inform parents of the progress their child is making; report cards are sent home four times during the school 
     year on a nine-week basis. Progress reports are sent home between report cards if a child is experiencing problems. 
      
     In addition to the written reports, every parent is given the opportunity to meet with their child9s teachers in a scheduled 
     conference after school.  Parent conferences will be held each November.  Please contact the elementary school to make 
     arrangements for a conference.  Parents may also schedule individual conferences, as needed, by contacting their child9s 
     teacher.  We always encourage parents to come in for conferences, and will make all attempts to work around your 
     schedule (within reason). 
      
       POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR CLASSROOM ASSIGNMENT IN WEST BRANCH AREA 
                              ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
      
     It is the intent of the West Branch Area Elementary School to maintain classrooms that are heterogeneously grouped. To 
     maintain an equitable balance of students in each room, the following procedures are followed: 
           
          1.  A team consisting of the principal, classroom teachers, and school counselor will review the following           
               information prior to grouping students: 
           
              A.  A grade level list of students identified as high, medium or low ability students as prepared by the     
                   current teacher. 
              B.  Advice from the learning support teacher in regard to any special needs their student9s may have. 
              C.  Recommendations from current homeroom teachers as to who should or should not be placed in the  
                    same room based on current peer interaction. 
              D.  Input from the school nurse based on her confidential health list. 
      
          2.  Classroom assignments will be made as equitable as possible with regard to gender, total number of  
                students, student abilities, student disabilities, or any other special needs a student may have. 
      
          3.  Parent Requests – Below are the guidelines for parent requests: 
           
              Requests made for a child to have a particular classroom teacher will not be accepted. This includes 
              asking for a male/female teacher, younger/veteran teacher, etc. as this may identify a particular staff 
              member without specifying that teacher by name. 
               
          NOTE:  There are a variety of reasons why specific teacher requests will not be granted (i.e. last-minute staffing 
              changes due to retirements, leave of absence, transfers, classes being added or reduced, etc. which may 
              create openings within our building, and that may impact our staffing). This policy is made in order to be 
              fair to all families and will allow us, as a team, to make the decisions which are in the best interest of every 
              student. 
      
          4.  Classroom lists will be reviewed by a grade level team of the current grade level and specials teachers for 
           any possible changes (i.e. behavior issues, student compatibility, academic issues, etc.). 
      
          5.  Classroom assignments will be provided prior to the start of the next academic year.  
          NOTE:  This assignment may change over the summer due to enrollment issues (i.e. student withdrawals causing 
                       an uneven number of students in a classroom) and/or staff issues. 
      
                                                                       16 
                      6.  New students enrolling in the elementary school over the summer will be assigned to the grade level 
                         classroom with the lowest number of students. 
                       
                      7.  If issues arise during the school year, they will be dealt with by the administration (including meeting with 
                         parents). 
                       
                     Additionally, the Equity Plan for Federal Programs can be viewed in Appendix H.  
                      
                                                                HOMEWORK GUIDELINES 
                                                                                       
           Definition: Homework is defined as tasks assigned to students by teachers that are meant to be carried out 
           during non-instructional hours.  It is intended to be a meaningful experience that prepares students for lessons, 
           practices basic skills, and reinforces concepts taught in class.  Homework assignments are created based upon 
           the intended purpose of the teacher. Examples of elementary assignments include: unfinished class work, 
           drill and practice exercises (spelling and vocabulary words, math facts, and computation), preparation for 
           tests, research activities and reports, projects, and reading/writing assignments.  
           Time: Homework will increase gradually in amount, variety, and frequency as students progress from 
           grade to grade.  The following time allotments are designed to give parents an understanding of how much 
           time their child might be expected to engage in homework each night.  These times are approximate and 
           some children may get done sooner while others may take more time to complete activities. Individual student9s 
           pace may need to be taken into consideration. We ask that problems or concerns be communicated directly to 
           the classroom teacher.

           The promotion of pupils from grade to grade is dependent upon: 
                               a.   Academic Achievement 
                               b.  Attendance 
            
           PROMOTION BASED ON ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT 
            
           The grading of the teacher and their evaluation of the students9 progress and achievement is a large determining factor in a 
           student9s promotion/retention.  In the elementary school, progress is from grade to grade. 
            
           In determining the promotion or retention of a student the guiding rule used by the teacher is, <What is best for the 
           student?= This, however, does not imply automatic promotion.  Promotion may not be the optimal solution for all 
           students. The teacher is obligated not to send a student into a classroom situation or environment in which that student 
           does not have a chance to experience success. <Success breeds success and failure breeds failure.= The student must be 
           placed in the grade level that best affords them the opportunity to experience success. 
            
                                                                                                                                                          17 
      
      
      
      
     Retention is based on a thorough analysis of the child9s ability to master skills and profit from retention, as compared to 
     automatic promotion into an academically frustrating environment that can only foster negative self-concept and self-
     esteem. Retention, therefore, requires an individual analysis of the effects that it may have on the total child 
     (academically, intellectually, psychologically, emotionally, physically, and socially). 
      
     The key person in determining a child9s readiness for the requirements associated with promotion into the next grade is 
     the teacher.  The teacher, better than anyone inside the school system, knows the academic problems and strengths 
     associated with the children under their tutelage.  Teachers are instructed to inform parents as soon as difficulties 
     affecting possible promotion arise.  This is accomplished through written reports, report cards, notes, and parent/teacher 
     conferences.  The elementary principal will be informed of and in agreement with all retentions. 
      
     PROMOTION BASED ON ATTENDANCE 
      
     If a student is absent 24 total days or more the student will be retained in their same grade for the following school year.  
     Please see the policy on Excessive Absences and the 24 Day Rule in the Attendance Section of this Handbook. 
                                         
                                     TITLE I 
                                         
     Our schoolwide Title I program is a federally funded program designed to assist students who are having difficulty in 
     reading.  Students are identified as eligible for Title I services through achievement test scores, curriculum-based 
     measures, local assessments, and/or teacher recommendation.  Students receive additional reading assistance through 
     small group instruction and other methods overseen by the Title I Reading Specialists.   
      
     A Title I Parent Meeting will be held during Meet the Teacher Night.  Parents will be notified of additional meetings that 
     occur.  If you have any questions about the Title I program or eligibility requirements, please contact the elementary 
     office. Appendix F contains documents related to the Title I program.  
      
                                         
                             HOMEBOUND INSTRUCTION 
      
     Homebound education is defined as carrying the public-school program into the home through the visiting teacher.  The 
     primary purpose of the program is to help the physically handicapped child and those students with extended absences due 
     to illness or injury to maintain the continuity of their class work.  Students who are absent from school for an extended 
     period of time may receive homebound instruction if the attending physician and the parents request, in writing this service.  
     Students must be re-evaluated every three months by a physician.  A student on Homebound will receive a maximum 
     of five (5) hours of instruction per week.

          STUDENT RECORDS 
      
                                    DISCLOSURE 
      
     School districts are permitted to disclose student records to state or local officials within the juvenile justice system.  School 
     districts may also release records concerning disciplinary action taken against a student for conduct that posed a significant 
     risk to the safety or well-being of that student or to other members of the school community without prior consent.  However, 
     such disclosures should be limited only to those teachers or school officials who have a <legitimate educational interest in 
     the behavior of that student.= 
      
                                      REVIEW 
      
     Parents/guardians of students under age 18 have a right to inspect and review a student9s educational records by 
     contacting the Guidance Office and scheduling a time for the review.  If the student and/or parent finds inaccurate or 
     misleading information he/she should request, in writing, that the Principal review the inaccurate or misleading 
     information and consider altering the same.  No personal information will be disclosed without prior approval except as 
     stated in the previous section <Disclosure.= 
      
     Complaints regarding compliance with the Federal Educational Rights and Privacy Act may be filed with the U.S. 
     Department of Education. 
      
      
      
      
          HEALTH OFFICE POLICIES 
       
     1. Students are to report to the nurse if they are ill, have an injury, or need to be evaluated for health 
     reasons.  Students may not use a cell phone or school building phones to call their parents to leave for health 
     problems.  If students use a cell phone or building phone to contact their parents without approval from the nurse, 
     the absence will be unexcused.  Students must be evaluated, and dismissed by the nurse if medically necessary to leave 
     school due to illness, injury, or other health reasons.  A parent can choose to take his/her child to the physician to get a 
     doctor9s excuse if the parent wishes for the absence to be considered an excused absence.  However, the student must be 
     evaluated by the physician the day the student left school and the excuse returned per the student handbook9s absence 
     procedures.  To be in compliance with attendance requirements, if students miss over 10 days of school and leave 
     school due to illness or injury, they must provide a doctor’s excuse for any absence from the school day.  The 
     school nurse is not able to provide the excuse for students with excessive absences.   
       
     2.  Please do not send your child to school and ask the nurse to diagnose your child’s health problem or previous 
     injury.  The nurse is not a physician, and under the Nurse Practice Act is not allowed to diagnose health conditions.  In 
     addition, if your child had an injury on a previous day, and is unable to participate in gym class; the school nurse cannot 
     excuse the student from gym class.  A doctor9s excuse is required.   
      
     3.  Please do not send your child to school if your child presents any symptoms of being ill.  These symptoms include 
     but are not limited to: fever, cough, sore throat, rashes. 
       
     4. The administration of medication to students by the nurse shall be permitted only upon the proper written 
     authorization by a physician (a signed physician9s order), and the student9s parent/ guardian’s written 
     consent.  This includes over- the-counter medications such as Tylenol and Advil.  The school nurse has 
     medication forms available in the health office, and available to download from the school nurses’ 
     webpage.  Please note that students must provide their own medications in the proper container labeled by the 
     manufacturer or pharmacy.  The school does not provide medications.  Students are not allowed to carry any 
     medications with them unless authorized by the school nurse.  In order to be permitted to carry medications, the  
                                                                          19 
     
     
     
    student must provide the school nurse with a physician9s order from the student9s physician stating that the student 
    is permitted to carry and self-administer the medication along with written parental consent.  Example:  inhalers and 
    emergency medications.  Any students carrying medications without a written physician9s order on file in the health 
    office, and permission from the nurse, are in violation of the school9s drug policy and may be disciplined.  This is 
    for the safety of all of the students in the district.   
       
    5. Health History Forms will be passed out to students yearly, are available in the health office, and available to 
    download from the school nurses’ webpage.  It is very important to update this form yearly and return it to the nurse so 
    the nurse is aware of any health problems that may impact your child during the school day.  If you choose not to indicate 
    that your child has any health problems, we ask that you still sign and return the form so that the nurses know that you 
    received it.  If you, the parent/guardian, would like any teacher, bus driver, or any other staff member to be made aware of 
    your child9s health problems, it is your responsibility to notify them.  The nurse will not routinely share this information 
    except in an emergency situation or if the nurse determines that an employee has an immediate need to know for the 
    welfare of your child.  In addition, if you notify the teacher of your child9s health condition, and you would also like the 
    nurse to be made aware of the same, it is your responsibility to notify the nurse. 
      
    6. All students must abide by the school health law and have the required health screenings and immunizations 
    completed for that grade.  Dental exams are mandatory for students in grades K, 3, and 7.  Physical exams are 
    mandatory for students in grades K, 6, and 11.  For dental and physical exams, parents have the option of either having a 
    school dental/ physical exam free of charge, or taking their child to their private dentist/physician at their expense, and 
    returning a copy of the exam to the school nurse prior to the date of the school screening/exam.  Private Physical and 
    Dental forms are available in the nurses’ office, and available to download from the school nurses’ webpage.  
    Vision, Height, Weight, and Body Mass Index (BMI) screenings will be done yearly as required by law.  Hearing 
    Screenings will be done for students in grades K, 1, 2, 3, 7, and 11 as required by law.  Scoliosis screenings will be done 
    for all 7th grade students as required by law.  Students who do not submit required immunization and health 
    screenings paperwork by deadlines set by the district will be excluded from school until this paperwork is 
    submitted to the school nurse.   
      
    7.  Students are not permitted to be in school with lice.  If a student is found to have lice during the school day, the 
    parent will be contacted and the child will be sent home.  Students will also be sent home if nits (lice eggs) are found 
    and the student was not recently treated with a lice shampoo.  It is the parent/guardian9s responsibility to properly 
    treat the lice, and return the student to school the next school day to be checked by the school nurse.   If the student 
    does not return to school the next school day, the student will only be excused for the day the student was sent home by 
    the nurse.   
     
    8.  Please address hygiene issues with your children at home.  Please be aware that children can be sensitive to odors, 
    such as odors from animals that may linger on clothing, chemicals, perfumes, and personal body odor.   
      
    9. Extra clothes – The nurses recommend that all students carry an extra set of clothes in their backpacks or store in 
    lockers.  Many times, extra clothes are needed for reasons such as bowel or bladder accidents, menstrual problems, 
    muddy/wet clothes, or food spills.  
     
    10. Temperature Checks - The District reserves the right to conduct temperature checks upon arrival for all employees, 
    students and visitors throughout the school years as warranted by increased illness rates. 
     
                  DELIVERY AND STORAGE OF MEDICATION 
     
    All medication shall be brought to the nurse9s office, or the main office if the nurse is in another building, by the 
    parent/guardian or by another adult designated by the parent/guardian. All medication shall be stored in the original 
    pharmacy-labeled container and kept in a locked cabinet designated for storage of medication. Medications that require 
    refrigeration shall be stored and locked in a refrigerator designated only for medications. The district shall not store more 
    than a thirty-day supply of an individual student9s medication. 
     
                                                          20 
          Medication should be recorded and logged in with the date, name of student, name of medication, amount of medication, 
          and signatures of the parent/guardian or designated adult delivering the medication and the school health personnel 
          receiving the medication. 
           
          Nonprescription medication must be delivered in its original packaging and labeled with the student9s name. 
           
          Prescription medication shall be delivered in its original packaging and labeled with: 
           
          1.        Name, address, telephone and federal DEA (Drug Enforcement Agency) number of the pharmacy. 
          2.        Student9s name. 
          3.        Directions for use (dosage, frequency and time of administration, route, special instructions). 
          4.        Name and registration number of the licensed prescriber. 
          5.        Prescription serial number. 
          6.        Date originally filled. 
          7.        Name of medication and amount dispensed. 
          8.        Controlled substance statement, if applicable. 
           
          All medication shall be accompanied by a completed Medication Administration Consent and Licensed Prescriber9s 
          Medication Order Form, or other written communication from the licensed prescriber. 
           
           
                    ATTENDANCE 
                                                                                     
                                             GENERAL ATTENDANCE POLICY INFORMATION 
                                                                                     
          Regular daily attendance is an integral part of an effective educational environment.  There is a positive relationship between 
          regular attendance and success in both school and the world of work.  Daily attendance contributes to a student9s sense of 
          responsibility, self-discipline, and good work habits.  Regular attendance is essential if students are to understand the 
          continuity of the curriculum and derive the maximum benefit from their fullest potential. 
           
          Compulsory school attendance is also a requirement in the Pennsylvania School Code.  Every child of compulsory school 
          age is required to attend school, unless absent for an approved reason.  Parents/guardians are charged with the 
          responsibility for their child9s/children9s school attendance.  School attendance is also mandated at the federal level, with 
          the federal law known as No Child Left Behind.  This law sets benchmarks for percent attendance rates to meet Adequate 
          Yearly Progress.    
           
          Because of state law and federal mandates, and to try to ensure the success of all students, the following attendance 
          policies have been developed.    
                                                                                     
                                                                 SUBMITTING EXCUSES 
                                                                                     
          Any time your child is absent from school, or any part of the school day, you must do the following: 
           
                    Submit a written excuse for the date(s)/time(s) your child missed school. 
                     
                    NOTE: By state law, this written excuse MUST be received within 3 days of your child’s return to  
                              school.  If it is Not received within 3 days, the absence will be marked as Unexcused.  THE  
                              ABSENCE WILL NOT BE CHANGED TO EXCUSED IF IT IS BROUGHT IN AFTER 
                              THE 3-DAY PERIOD. 
           
          Excuses can now be submitted to the secretaries via Parent Square by replying to the absence message the 
          parent receives for each absence.  
           
          If you feel there is an error (your child was in school) or if you do not receive a message when your child is absent, please 
          contact the elementary office so we can correct this. 
                                                                                                                                                       21

       contribute to the allotted number of days a student may be absent before a doctor9s note is required (10 days). 
       Noncumulative absences do not contribute to the allotted number of days.

          Student absent from school with parent           Parents may provide notes for 10 days of absence.  Once a student reaches 10 
          note                                             cumulative absences a doctor9s note is required for all future absences. 
                                                           NOTE:  Parent note must be turned in within 3 days after the student 
                                                           returns to school.  If a note is not turned in within 3 days the absence 
                                                           becomes unexcused.  Any illness or injury that exceeds three (3) days must 
                                                           be substantiated by a doctor’s note.

                                                           for Educational Trips.  If the student has 10 cumulative absences prior to or 
                                                           during the Educational Trip, the trip will not be approved. For example, if a 
                                                           student has eight absences and applies for a five-day educational trip, two

                                                           as unexcused absences.

                                                           excused.  If the student does not turn in a doctor’s note, the absence will

         The superintendent will make the final decision on whether absences for these reasons will be considered Excused or 
         Unexcused.  If an absence is considered Excused it would be a Cumulative Absence and fall under this category (see  
         above for more information).   
                  
         NONCUMULATIVE ABSENCES – These absences DO NOT count toward the 10 parent absences permitted 
         before a doctor’s note is required. 
          
          
          
                      Reason for absence                                           Information about absence 
          Suspensions from school                        Since the school is suspending the student, a note from the parent is not 
                                                         required. 
          Illness verified by a doctor’s note            The doctor9s note must be submitted within 3 days of the student9s return. If a 
                                                         physician’s note is not received within three (3) days of a student’s return, 
                                                         the absence will be considered a cumulative unexcused absence.  Parents 
                                                         are responsible for ensuring the school receives a physician’s note.  If the 
                                                         physician’s office is faxing a note, please check with the physician to make 
                                                         sure the note was faxed, and with the school to make sure the note was 
                                                         received.  The District reserves the right to contact the dentist or physician to 
                                                         verify appointments. 
          Death in the family                            The student will be considered excused from the date of death until two (2) 
                                                         days after the funeral unless otherwise authorized by the principal or designee. 
                                                         The parent must send in a note listing all of the days absent for the 
                                                         absence to be Excused (note must be submitted within 3 days of the 
                                                         student’s return). 
          Religious holidays                             The parent must submit a note detailing the reason for the absence within 3 
                                                         days of the student9s return to school. 
          School-sponsored activities                    If the student is absent for a field trip or some other trip, the student will be 
                                                         considered Excused.  No note is required to excuse the absence. 
          Medical appointments (i.e. doctor/dentist)     An excuse must be submitted from the doctor/dentist within 3 days of the 
                                                         student9s return.  The excuse should include: student9s name, date of 
                                                         appointment, time of appointment, doctor signature. 
                                                         If a doctor’s note is not received for the appointment, the absence will be 
                                                         considered a parent note absence (Cumulative Absence) and count toward 
                                                         the 10 days (before a doctor’s note is required). 
          Student sent home from the nurse9s office      If the student is later seen by a doctor and we receive a doctor9s note, the 
          – doctor note received                         absence will be Noncumulative (see below).  If we do not receive a doctor9s 
                                                         note, the absence will be considered a parent note absence and count toward 
                                                         the 10 days before a doctor9s not is required.

            Early dismissal will be granted under certain conditions for medical appointments.  When requesting an early dismissal, a 
            written request must be presented to the office at least one (1) day in advance of the requested day.  If a request is not 
            presented at least one (1) day in advance the parent/guardian will be required to come to the school and sign the student out.  
            Parents must report to the office before picking up a student.  Students are responsible for all work missed due to an early 
            dismissal.  All students, regardless of age must adhere to this policy! 
             
            NOTE: A student must have a valid reason to be excused early from school.  If a student does not have a valid reason for dismissal, the absence will be counted as an 
            unexcused absence.  If a student has an early dismissal for a doctor appointment, the student must provide a physician9s note within three (3) days of their return to school 
            for the excuse to be counted as an excused absence.  If a doctor9s note is not received within three (3) days, the absence will be considered unexcused/illegal. 
             
             
                                        WITHDRAWAL - 10 OR MORE DAYS OF CONSECUTIVE ABSENCE 
                          
            If a student is absent from school for ten (10) consecutive school days, the student will be removed from the active school 
            roster unless one of the following occurs: 
                         a.    The district has been provided with evidence that the student9s absence may be legally excused 
                         b.

          NOTE:  Out of School Suspension days will not be counted toward the 24-day rule.  Also, periods of extended medical 
          absences of consecutive days verified by a physician9s note may NOT be combined toward the 24 Day Rule.  Each   
          individual absence counts as 1 day toward the 24 Day Rule and retention in the same grade.

                                                                                APPEALS PROCESS 
             
            To appeal student retention due to 24 total absences, the parent/guardian must submit a written request for appeal to the 
            principal within 10 days of receiving the 24-day letter.  A meeting will be held with a committee appointed by the 
            principal.  At this meeting the parent may present appropriate evidence.  The burden of proof of attendance shall be on the 
            student/parent/guardian.     
             
                                                                                   NEW STUDENTS

                      be turned in to the elementary office AT LEAST ONE WEEK PRIOR TO THE TRIP.  If the Educational 
                      Trip form is not turned in at least one week prior to the trip, the days missed may be counted as 
                      unexcused/illegal absences. 
                 B.  Students with attendance, academic, or discipline issues may not receive approval.  NOTE:  If the student has 
                      missed 10 cumulative days or 17 total days prior to submitting the request, or if the student will miss over 
                      10 cumulative days or 17 total days counting the trip, the request will NOT be approved.  Days missed will 
                      be considered as unexcused/illegal absences.    
                 C.  Students are only permitted a maximum of 5 days total per school year for Educational Trips. 
                 D.  Students are responsible for getting work from their teachers PRIOR TO going on the trip.  Students should have 
                      work to turn in upon their return from their trip. 
                 E.  Parents/Guardians will be responsible for the education of the student during the trip, assuring the completion of 
                      assignments and any make-up work. 
                 F.  Upon their return to school, students should turn in their assigned work.  They must also complete any other work

                      COMPLETED AND TURNED IN TO THEIR TEACHERS WITHIN FIVE DAYS OF THEIR RETURN 
                      TO SCHOOL, THEIR ABSENCES FOR THE EDUCATIONAL TRIP WILL BE CONSIDERED 
                      UNEXCUSED. 
                 H.  The School District shall accept neither financial responsibility nor liability for students excused for the purpose of 
                      educational travel. 
                 I.   DAYS MISSED FOR EDUCATIONAL TRIPS WILL COUNT INDIVIDUALLY TOWARD THE 24 DAY

          TRANSPORTATION 
                                          
                              SCHOOL BUS PROCEDURES 
                                          
     REGULATIONS 
      
     The School Laws (24-2421) of Pennsylvania permit school boards to provide transportation for elementary students living 
     more than one and a half (1 ½) miles from school and for secondary students living more than two (2) miles from school.  
     The transportation service provided by the West Branch Area Board of Education is a privilege which may be denied to 
     students who misbehave on the bus.  Students and parents/guardians must be aware of and observe the following 
     regulations: 
        1.  The bus driver is in charge of maintaining discipline on the bus and has the authority to verbally reprimand any 
          student who misbehaves. The bus driver may assign seats for students and may change seat assignments at any 
          time in order to control student behavior. For their own safety all students are expected to remain seated at all 
          times while the bus is in motion. 
        2.  Bus riding privileges may be suspended for up to ten (10) days for misbehavior.  Examples: 
            ●  Failing to follow reasonable instructions form the driver 
            ●  Eating, drinking, or chewing gum on the school bus 
            ●  Entering or leaving the bus at any other point than the front door 
            ●  Not keeping arms, hands, and heads inside the bus at all times 
            ●  Not keeping conversations at low volume, as prescribed by the bus driver.  There should be no shouting 
               or screaming, or any behavior which might endanger anyone9s safety. 
          NOTE:  For serious or repeated offenses, a student may lose riding privileges for more than 10 days (possibly 
                       for the remainder of the school year). 
        3.  The parent/guardian must reimburse the bus contractor the full amount of repair/replacement costs or any 
          intentional damage to a bus by a student. 
        4.  In addition to suspension of riding privileges, misconduct on a school bus can also result in detention or 
          suspension. 
        5.  When a student9s bus privileges have been suspended, the parent/guardian will be notified by phone and/or in 
          writing.  The parent/guardian will be responsible for the suspended student9s transportation and attendance during 
          the suspension. 
      
                                 STUDENT BUS RULES 
                                          
     NOTE: Parents are asked to keep your address correct with the school so that your child can receive the 
     appropriate transportation throughout the school year. It is also required that all students utilize their assigned 
     bus stop on a daily basis unless a note is present at the school and in the possession of the student; we ask that this 
     be done so accurate records are available in case of an emergency. 
      
     NOTE: Senate Bill 1077, Act 56 of 2016. The bill permits those school districts engaging in audio recording on 
     school busses to fulfill the notification requirement, which originally required an annual notice to be mailed 
     home to each student, by including the policy in a student handbook and in any other publication of the school 
     entity that sets forth the comprehensive rules, procedures and standards of conduct for the school entity as well 
     as posting a notice of the policy on the district website. 
      
                       LOADING AND UNLOADING AT THE BUS STOP  
      
        1.  Be at your assigned loading zone on time (5 minutes before pickup).  Buses cannot wait for late students and still 
          get to school on time. 
        2.  Exercise extreme caution in getting to and from your assigned bus stop. 
        3.  Look in both directions before stepping from behind parked cars. 
        4.  Stay well off the roadway until the bus comes to a complete stop and the bus driver indicates that it is safe to 
          board. 
        5.  Do not play on or near the road while waiting for the bus to arrive. 
                                                                          30 
     
     
     
      6.  Look in both directions before crossing the roadway. 
      7.  Never walk on the road when there is a sidewalk or pathway. 
      8.  Always walk on the left side of the road facing oncoming traffic and step off the road when a motor vehicle 
        approaches. 
      9.  Wait until the bus comes to a complete stop before trying to load or unload. 
      10. All articles of clothing or attachments that dangle or swing freely while a student is walking must be secured 
        before boarding the bus. 
      11. Use the handrail while getting on and off the bus. 
      12. If possible, wear white or light-colored clothing or carry a flashlight if you walk on the roadway in the dark in 
        order that the motoring public can see you. 
      13. When you must cross the road to board or exit the bus always cross at least 10 feet in front of the bus after getting 
        the <okay= from the driver. 
      14. Occasionally buses are delayed due to weather or traffic conditions.  Student should wait a reasonable amount of 
        time for a bus that is late.  Parental discretion is needed for the amount of time depending on weather conditions. 
        If a bus is more than fifteen minutes late please call the school office. 
     
    Due to the obvious lack of supervision the school can provide at bus stops, parents must assume responsibility for the 
    conduct and safety of their own child as they walk to (and from) the stop and wait for the bus.  Rules/regulations of 
    student conduct and appropriate behavior also apply at these times. Students who violate them are subject to the school 
    discipline code. Throwing rocks, snowballs or other harmful objects is not permitted at bus stops. 
     
    Students in Kindergarten, First, and Second grade must have an adult (16 years of age or older) present at the bus 
    stop in order to be permitted to exit the bus.  If no adult is present, the student will be brought back to the school.  At 
    that time, an adult will be required to pick the student up from school.  In the event that this happens three (3) times within 
    a semester (2 marking periods), the student will lose their bus riding privileges for three (3) days.  These days will reset 
    with the change of the semester. 
     
                            BUS NOTES 
     
    West Branch Area SD may provide transportation to/from an alternate location, provided there is room available on the 
    route and the following guidelines are met: 
    1.  The alternate location is consistent five days per week for morning and afternoon.  Alternative locations will remain 
    the same for at least one semester.  Example:  Student may be transported from one location to school in the AM and from 
    one school to another location in the PM. 
    2.  The alternate location is along a regularly scheduled route at a regularly scheduled stop. 
     
    WHILE ON THE BUS/GETTING ON THE BUS AT SCHOOL 
    The rules/policies for Riding the Bus and Getting on the Bus at School are included in the Discipline section of this 
    handbook.  Please read this section (Under School-Wide Positive Behavior Support).

          EXTRA-CURRICULLAR PARTICIPATION 
           
                          GENERAL RULES OF PARTICIPATION 
      
     The West Branch Area School District reserves the right to restrict participation in extracurricular activities (i.e. field 
     trips, assemblies, class trips, etc.).  Students will be ineligible to participate in extracurricular activities if any of the 
     following occur: 
      
     ACADEMIC ISSUES 
      
     Students must meet basic academic requirements to participate in extracurricular activities.  Students who have academic 
     issues (i.e. low grades, incomplete homework) will not be allowed to participate in extracurricular activities until all work 
     is made up.  In order to participate in any activities relating to PSSA test, the student must participate in the assessment. 
      
     ATTENDANCE 
      
     Any student accruing 17 days of absence will be ineligible to participate in extracurricular activities until the student is 
     present for 45 school days.  Any days the student is absent will not count toward the 45-day requirement. 
      
     Any student accruing 24 days of absence will be ineligible to participate in extracurricular activities for the remainder of 
     the school year. 
      
      
     DISCIPLINE 
      
     *Discipline referrals refer to Major behavior infractions, as explained in the PBS Section of the handbook.  
      
     Any student accruing 10 discipline/attendance referrals will be ineligible to participate in extracurricular activities for 45 
     school days.  Any additional referrals during the 45-day period will result in an additional 5 days added on to the 
     ineligibility period. 
      
     Any student accruing 15 discipline/attendance referrals will be ineligible to participate in extracurricular activities for the 
     remainder of the school year. 
      
     OUTSTANDING OBLIGATIONS TO THE SCHOOL DISTRICT 
      
     The West Branch Area School District reserves the right to restrict participation in extracurricular activities if students 
     have any outstanding obligations to the district.  Examples would include: overdue lunch account balances, overdue 
     library books, vandalism, fundraising debts, etc.  Participation in extracurricular activities and field trips will be restored 
     when all obligations have been fulfilled. 
                         
                                                                          32 
      
     PROCEDURES AND EXPECTATIONS FOR STUDENTS ON OVERNIGHT TRIPS 
     The West Branch Area School Board is supportive of our student groups when requesting overnight trips. These trips 
     many times allow for greater competition and the opportunity for our students to learn and/or improve their skills. We also 
     understand that there are many more risks for our students9 safety. To help keep our students safe the following 
     procedures and expectations will be in effect. 
       1.  Rules:  All school rules apply during overnight trips. School rule violations preceding the trip may result in the 
          denial of attending the trip. Coaches/advisors will review these rules with students before the trip departs. 
          Students are reminded that they must respect each other and that there must be no bullying, harassment, hazing, 
          fighting, or other misconduct. Students should report any misconduct immediately to a coach/advisor. The staff 
          will be even more vigilant about enforcing school rules on the trip and students will face serious disciplinary 
          action for any misconduct. Students are expected to remain in their rooms in the direction of their coach/advisor 
          and/or chaperone at all times. Violations will result in administrative review. Following the review, disciplinary 
          action up to and including removal from the team/student group will be administered. Violations relating to drugs, 
          alcohol, and/or weapons will result in an immediate call to the appropriate authorities. 
       2.  Supervision: The coaches/advisors and their assistants/chaperones must supervise students whenever possible 
          during the trip, including in the middle of the night. Students are expected to adhere to all directives given by 
          coaches/advisors and/or chaperones. 
       3.  Searches: Searches of students9 personal property, purses, briefcases, backpacks, and bags will be conducted if 
          there is reasonable suspicion that a student is violating school rules or the law. These searches may occur at any 
          time; before, during, and/or after the trip. Coaches/advisors and/or chaperones will be in contact with 
          administration during the search process. 
       4.  Release of Student: If a student has violated the law, such as by possessing drugs, alcohol, or a weapon, in 
          addition to calling the authorities, parents may be requested to retrieve their child from the trip. In the event of 
          parent/guardian refusal to retrieve their child from the trip, any associated costs to return the student will be the 
          responsibility of the parent/guardian. 
      
      
      
      
      
           CAFETERIA PROCEDURES & GENERAL POLICIES 
                                        
     The goal of cafeteria services is to provide nutritious meals, within USDA-approved guidelines, to promote optimum 
     student performance in the classroom. Menus are posted in the cafeteria and circulated throughout classrooms and offices. 
     Menus are also posted on the school9s web page (www.westbranch.org). 
      
     At West Branch, students may choose whether or not to participate in lunch meal programs.  
      
     Teachers and/or monitors are responsible for maintaining an orderly and pleasant atmosphere in the cafeteria. Shouting, 
     unnecessary moving around, and boisterous behavior which interferes with a climate conducive to good eating habits and 
     a comfortable environment for all are not permitted. 
      
                       MEAL PRICES AND BUYING PROCEDURES 
      
     **All students receive free breakfast and lunch. Extras and snacks will be charged to the student9s account. All students 
     will still be required to enter their account code into the system to aide staff in tracking and ordering supplies.  
      
                                                                       33 
    A computerized pre-pay accounting system maintains student accounts and meal data. Parents may send payments of cash 
    or checks payable to West Branch Cafeteria for deposit into individual student accounts. Payments should include name, 
    homeroom, and amount enclosed to assure accuracy. Payment boxes are provided in the office and cafeteria to collect 
    payments every morning.  Payments must be deposited by 8:40 AM to ensure same day credit.  Payment can also be made 
    via the My School Bucks website, which can be accessed under the Food Service tab on the West Branch website.  These 
    accounts are debited as students purchase meals, milk, etc.   
     
    Students report to the cafeteria at their designated lunch time, receive their tray, and enter their individual PIN number. 
    The transaction is entered into the computer and the student9s individual account is debited.   
     
    Students are encouraged to bring in payments without excessive reminders. Parents are also encouraged to keep records at 
    home so payments can be sent in a timely manner. This reduces paperwork and time spent maintaining the system 
    Individual student account information is available upon request. We encourage payments to be made in the form of a 
    check.  This ensures that we can track your child9s payments.  Cash payments are not traceable.  Large amounts of 
    change must be rolled.  We will not accept large amounts of loose change.  A $25.00 fee plus banking charges will 
    be charged for any returned checks. 
     
    As a matter of standard practice, refunds are processed for students who withdraw and graduating seniors, for account 
    balances over $2.00 after the end of the school year. The school reserves the right to initiate legal action for unpaid 
    negative account balances.  Students with negative account balances of $5.00 or more will not be allowed to 
    participate in extracurricular activities (i.e. field trips, assemblies). 
     
    At West Branch, students may choose whether or not to participate in lunch meal programs. The cafeteria provides meals 
    via an offer versus serve system.  Under this system, the student may decide not to select any one of the five lunch items

                                       SCHOOL-WIDE POSITIVE BEHAVIOR SUPPORT 
          
         The purpose of the School-Wide Positive Behavior plan at West Branch Elementary is to ensure a positive school climate 
         that fosters cooperation, academic excellence, safety, respect, and readiness. 
          
          
                  We can Be safe – Keep your hands, feet, and objects to yourself.  Consider the personal space 
                                               of others while remaining calm and in control of yourself. 
          We can Be respectful – Use language and actions that show concern and consideration toward all 
                                                adults, fellow students, and school property. 
                 We can Be ready – Be where you are supposed to be on time.  Have all of your materials  
                                                 (homework, pen/pencil, books, etc.) out and ready to go.  Be attentive. 
                  
                                          
                                                                                                                              35 
     
     
     
     
    The PBS program is a school-wide behavior program.  Research shows us that students achieve at a higher level when 
    they know the expectations and feel safe. Positive Behavior Support will help us improve both of these. Our plan provides 
    detailed expectations in every area of the school while putting an extreme emphasis on safety, respect, and readiness. 
     
    We display posters around the building, in classrooms, and during classroom activities. All staff will take the time to teach 
    their students the positive behaviors they are expected to demonstrate at school, as well as the consequences for not 
    following these behaviors. We will acknowledge and reinforce students who consistently demonstrate these positive 
    behaviors.   
     
    Research shows us that school behavior plans that are followed in the home greatly improve their effectiveness in the 
    school. Throughout this process, West Branch Elementary will provide information to parents to help with home 
    implementation of the Positive Behavior Support Plan. 
     
    PARENTS/GUARDIANS: 
     
    Please take some time to review with your child the positive behavior expectations described on the attached matrix and 
    throughout this plan.  Ask your child questions to make sure he/she understands the expectations in different 
    environments around the school.  Please discuss the importance of these concepts and encourage your child to be a 
    positive influence in the school.  With your continued support and involvement, there is no question that West Branch 
    Elementary will continue to be a place where students can excel in a safe and stimulating environment. 
     
    **Note:  To align with our discipline referral system (Educator Handbook), Level 1 and 2 Infractions are now 
    referred to as <Minor= infractions and are handled at the classroom level with consequences assigned by the 
    teacher; Level 3 and 4 Infractions are now referred to as <Major= and may result in an office referral with 
    consequences assigned by the principal. 
    The elementary school offers various levels of support based on student needs. 
     
    The Tier I PBS Team manages the general expectations and rewards that apply to all students. The Tier II Team offers 
    additional support at the school level for students who struggle to meet academic or behavior expectations. The 
    ESAP/Tier III Team offers support for major academic and behavior concerns that may include outside services to address 
    issues such as drug/alcohol use, suicide concerns, etc. Each team is composed of grade level teachers, specials teachers,  
    and other school staff as appropriate. Each team is overseen by the principal and guidance counselor. See additional 
    details for each Tier Team below.  
        
                         Tier I Program and Team  
     
    One important aspect of this program is creating a set of school-wide rules and expectations.  These rules/expectations 
    will be followed no matter where the student is – classroom, hallway, playground, cafeteria, specials, buses, etc.   PBS 
    The Tier I Team ensures PBS lessons are taught by classroom teachers and administrators at the beginning of the school 
    year and as refreshers throughout the school year.  
     
    The Tier I Team is also responsible for developing, tracking, and updating the rewards system described below.

         Students who respect the guidelines for acceptable behavior will be rewarded with success in school, respect from others, 
         personal recognition, and participation in school-wide events.  Recognition for appropriate behaviors includes, but is not 
         limited to:

                    CONSEQUENCES AND DOCUMENTATION 
      
     In addition to rewards, the Tier I PBS team is responsible for regularly reviewing, updating, and tracking consequences. 
      
     Despite teaching, modeling and reinforcing expected behaviors within the school setting, students will make mistakes and 
     demonstrate poor choices. When inappropriate behaviors are displayed, students should be redirected and reminded of 
     appropriate behaviors. However, when students continue to display inappropriate behaviors, despite redirection, or when 
     students demonstrate behaviors that put others at risk, consequences for those behaviors must be provided.  
      
     In order to increase tracking of student behavior, West Branch Elementary School documents problem behaviors online. 
     This allows staff members to document a student behavior via drop-down menu choices. Furthermore, staff members are 
     able to look up student9s discipline records and graph data based upon student, location, time, or behavior. Graphs will be 
     provided to staff members monthly to determine where additional interventions may be needed.  
     Minor Referral (previously referred to as level 1 and 2 infractions):  
      
     Minor Documentation: Students who have been documented as displaying guidance concerns/minor behaviors will not 
     receive consequences for these behaviors. The guidance concerns are logged so that teachers and guidance counselors 
     may track changes in student behavior that could be related to mental health issues or significant changes in student 
     environments that could have an effect on educational success. 
      
     Minor Referrals: Students who demonstrate classroom-managed behavior concerns should be re-taught/redirected 
     following the behavior.  
      
       ●  If the student has been retaught/redirected regarding a specific behavior, and that behavior continues, the teacher 
         should 1) reteach the appropriate behavior, 2) provide a classroom-based consequence, and 3) log the behavior 
         and the consequence within the discipline tracking system web site. 
       ●  If the student continues to demonstrate the inappropriate behavior, the teacher should 1) reteach the appropriate 
         behavior, 2) provide a classroom-based consequence, 3) contact the parent, and 4) log the behavior, parent 
         contact, and the consequence within the discipline tracking system web site. 
       ●  If the student continues to demonstrate the inappropriate behavior, the teacher should 1) reteach the appropriate 
         behavior, 2) provide a classroom-based consequence, 3) contact the parent, and 4) log the behavior as an office 
         referral:  Major Repeated Disruption of Educational Environment. 
        
      
     Major <Office= Referrals (previously referred to as level 3 and 4 infractions): 
 
     Major: If a student demonstrates a Major behavior concern (see Infraction List on next page), the teacher should 
     immediately contact the office (Principal and Director of Special Ed, if applicable) and/or School-Based (for identified 
     students) and document the behavior and any classroom consequences in Educator Handbook. The student will receive an 
     office-based consequence (i.e. detention, ISS, OSS), and a consequence letter will be sent to the student9s parent/ 
     guardian.  A signed copy of the consequence letter should be returned to the office the following day.  
      
     Students who exhibit Major behaviors will be referred to the Tier 2 Team for additional support.

                                                TIER 2 Program and Team  
        West Branch Elementary staff members are providing continued redirection, modeling and reinforcement for appropriate 
        student behavior throughout the year. However, some students may still struggle to demonstrate expected behaviors. 
        These students may demonstrate internalizing, externalizing, or organizational concerns. When staff members (teachers or 
        the Tier 1 Team) identify such students, they should be referred to the Tier 2 Team. The Tier 2 Team will determine if a 
        student should be included in one of our many intervention options based on his/her individual needs. 
         
        Parents will be notified when a student is recommended for Tier 2 and why. All suggested interventions will be shared 
        with parents. Communication between the school and parents is an important part of all levels of the PBS program. All 
        interventions will be monitored by the Tier 2 Team to ensure they are appropriate for the student and meet the student’s 
        individual needs. Data will be collected to determine the level of success of interventions and changes will be made as 
        needed.    
         
         
                                      
                                                                                                                 39 
         
         
         
         
        An example of a Tier 2 Intervention is a Check In/Check Out. The student would: 
           ●  Check in with an adult before school 
           ●  Carry a tracking form 
           ●  Ask their teacher to rate their behavior 
           ●  Check out at the end of each day 
           ●  Take the form home to parents 
           ●  Return the form the next day 
         
        Tier 2 is designed to facilitate positive interactions between students and assigned adults, teach good behavior skills, and 
        provide a means for home-school communication.  
         
        Parents can refer their child to the Tier II Team with any concerns by contacting the child9s homeroom teacher.  
         
                                            TIER 3/ESAP Program and Team 
         
        The Elementary Student Assistance Program is a team of professionals working together to provide help for students who 
        are experiencing problems.  Alcohol and other drug abuse, disruptions at home, depression, pressure from peers, trouble at 
        work, loss of a loved one, or many other factors can lead a student to feel alone and hopeless.  The cause may differ, but 
        the result is usually the same - the student9s problems interfere with educational process - a student who is troubled 
        struggles to learn.

        It is the parent's right to be involved in the process and to have full access to all school records under applicable state and 
        federal laws and regulations.  Involvement of parents in all phases of the student assistance program underscores the parent's 
        role and responsibility in the decision-making process affecting their child's education and is key to the successful resolution 
        of problems. 
        A student can be referred to the program by parents, teachers, and/or friends.  This can be accomplished by contacting any 
        SAP team member or completing the referral form on the school website.  From there, the referral is considered by the team 
        and recommendations are made for support such as: Tier 2 Intervention, homework club, school-based support services, 
        etc.  The information gathered is confidential.  The evaluation service is at no cost to the family or student.  We are here to 
        help!

      Parents must pick up their children at the elementary office at 4:30 p.m. – transportation home is not provided.  Students 
      must bring work to detention, as this is a silent work period.  
       
       
                                 IN-SCHOOL SUSPENSION 
       
      Students who have ISS must report to the elementary office after announcements.  Students must have all necessary 
      materials (books, A.R. book, etc.) when they arrive at the ISS room.  Students must work on their assignments and are not 
      permitted to talk.  Failure to complete any assigned class work could result in a 0% for that assignment.  Students will be 
      dismissed to their homeroom to get all materials to take home. 
       
                               OUT OF SCHOOL SUSPENSION

      includes Friday, the student is not permitted on school property over the weekend.  The student is not permitted to participate 
      in any extracurricular activities during the length of the suspension (including weekends if the suspension includes a Friday).  
      At the student or parent9s request, the guidance office will attempt to furnish assignments.  Students are still responsible for 
      all work.

                                 SEARCHES AND SEIZURES 
       
      To maintain order and discipline in the schools and to protect the safety and welfare of students and school personnel, 
      school authorities may search a student, student9s locker and desk and may seize any illegal, unauthorized or contraband 
      materials discovered in the search.  Student desks and lockers are school property and may be searched at any time by 
      authorized school officials.  Periodic inspections of lockers and desks may be conducted at any time by school personnel 
      without notice. 
       
      Students9 personal effects (book bag, purse, athletic bag, etc.), as well as a motor vehicle parked on school property, may 
      be searched if there is a reasonable suspicion to believe that illegal or unauthorized materials may be found, or that the 
      student is violating law, school board policy or school rules, or poses a threat to the student or the school population.  
      Searches conducted by the administration may include, but not be limited to, utilization of certified drug dogs or any 
      device used to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the student and the school population.  A student9s failure to 
      permit searches and seizures will result in a 5-day suspension and possible police contact. 
                                             
                                             
                                  VIDEO SURVEILLANCE 
       
      To ensure the safety of all students and visitors, the high school building is equipped with video cameras and recording 
      devices.  All students and visitors who enter the high school building acknowledge that they are subject to video 
      surveillance upon entering the building.  These recordings may be used as evidence against the student/visitor in 
      disciplinary, juvenile, or criminal proceedings.   
                           
                                                                               41

     may be readily assembled. 
      
     Guidelines – Any student who is determined to have brought or possessed a weapon in school or school facility shall be 
     expelled from school for a period of not less than one (1) year.  The expulsion proceeding shall follow the procedures 
     outlined in West Branch Area School District Policy #233.  The Superintendent may recommend discipline short of 
     expulsion on a case-by-case basis. 
      
     The Superintendent may, on a case-by-case basis, modify the period of expulsion for those students receiving services 
     under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, consistent with the rules and regulations governing the education of 
     exceptional children there under.   
      
     Students and staff shall be informed concerning this policy at least annually. 
      
     An exception to this policy may be made by the Superintendent, who shall prescribe special conditions or procedures to 
     be followed.

     The principal will report the discovery of any weapon prohibited by the weapons policy to the student9s parents 
     and to local law enforcement officials. The superintendent will report all expulsions for possession of a weapon 
     to the Department of Education. 
                                                                          42 
      
      
      
                                          
                           CONFIDENTIAL COMMUNICATIONS 
      
     Statutes govern the use of a student9s confidential communications to school personnel in legal proceedings and 
     regulations appropriate to the proceeding.  42 PA C.S. ss5945 (relating to confidential communications to school 
     personnel) 
      
     Information received in confidence from a student may be revealed to the student9s parents, the principal or other 
     appropriate authority where the health, welfare or safety of the student of other persons is clearly in jeopardy.

     conduct.  Sexual harassment may include, but is not limited to, the following: Verbal harassment or abuse, pressure for 
     sexual activity, repeated remarks with sexual or demeaning implications, unwelcome touching, suggesting or demanding 
     sexual involvement accompanied by implied or explicit threats (see West Branch Area School District Policy #248). 
      
     Any person who alleges sexual harassment may file a complaint with the building principal. A substantiated charge will 
     result in disciplinary action. All complaints will be sent to the Title IX coordinator for action. 
      
                                    HEARINGS 
      
     Education is a statutory right, and students must be afforded all appropriate elements of due process if they are to be 
     excluded from school.  In a case involving a possible expulsion, the student is entitled to a formal hearing, which is a 
     fundamental element of due process (see West Branch Area School District Policies #219 and #233). 
                                          
                                          
                                    DRESS CODE 
      
     The Board recognizes that each student's mode of dress and grooming is a manifestation of personal style and individual 
     preference. The Board has the authority to impose limitations on students' dress in school. The Board will not interfere 
     with the right of students and their parents/guardians to make decisions regarding their appearance, except when their 
     choices disrupt the educational program of the schools or affect the health and safety of others. 
      
     Students may be required to wear certain types of clothing while participating in physical education classes, technical 
     education, extracurricular activities, or other situations where special attire may be required to ensure the health or safety 
     of the student. 
      
     The building principal or designee shall be responsible to monitor student dress and grooming and to enforce Board 
     Policy and school rules governing student dress and grooming. The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that all rules 
     implementing this policy impose only the minimum necessary restrictions on the exercise of the student's taste 
     and individuality. Staff members shall be instructed to demonstrate by example positive attitudes toward neatness, 
     cleanliness, propriety, modesty, and good sense in attire and appearance. 
      
     Therefore, these rules can be changed at the discretion of the School Board and/or the Administration.  The 
     following is a list of guidelines and inappropriate articles of clothing or accessories which are expressly forbidden:

         PROGRAMS FOR ELIGIBLE OR PROTECTED HANDICAPPED STUDENTS 
      
     In compliance with the state and federal law, notice is hereby given by the West Branch Area School 
     District that it conducts ongoing identification activities as a part of its school program for the purpose of 
     identifying students who may need special education and related services. If your child is 
     identified by the District as possibly in need of such services, you will be notified of applicable procedures. 
     Individualized services and programs are available for children who are determined to need specially 
     designed instruction due to the following conditions: 
      
         1. Autism/pervasive developmental disorder 
         2. Blindness or visual impairment 
         3. Deafness or hearing impairment 
         4. Developmental delay 
         5. Mentally gifted 
         6. Intellectually disabled 
         7. Multi-handicapped 
         8. Neurological impairment 
         9. Other health impairments 
                 10. Physical disability 
                 11. Serious emotional disturbance 
                 12. Specific learning disability 
                 13. Speech and language impairment 
      
     If you believe that your school-age child may need special education services and related programs, or your child (age 3 to 
     school-age) may need early intervention, screening, and evaluation processes designed to assess the needs of the child and 
     his/her eligibility are available to you at no cost, upon written request. You may request screening and evaluation at any 
     time, whether or not your child is enrolled in the District9s public-school program. Requests for evaluation and screening 
     are to be made in writing to the principal or special education supervisor. 
      
     In compliance with state and federal law, the West Branch Area School District will provide to each protected 
     handicapped student without discrimination or cost to the student or family, those related aids, services or 
     accommodations which are needed to provide equal opportunity to participate in and obtain the benefits of the school 
     program and extracurricular activities to the maximum intent appropriate to the student9s abilities. In order to qualify as a 
     protected handicapped student, the child must be school age with a physical or mental disability that substantially limits or 
     prohibits participation in or access to an aspect of the school program. These services and protections for <protected 
     handicapped students= are distinct from those applicable to all eligible or exceptional students enrolled (or seeking 
     enrollment) in special education programs. 
      
     For further information on the rights of parents and children, provision of services, evaluation and screening (including 
     purpose time and location), and the rights to due process procedures, you may contact the special education supervisor.

      Dear Parents / Guardians:                           
       
      West Branch Area School District has an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Program for control of insects, rodents and 
      weeds.  Our IPM Program focuses on making the school building and grounds an unfavorable habitat for pests by 
      removing food and water sources and eliminating pests9 hiding and breeding places.  We accomplish this through 
      routine cleaning and maintenance.  We monitor the school buildings and grounds to detect any pests that are present.  
      The pest monitoring team consists of our building maintenance, office, and teaching staff, as well as our students.  Pest 
      sightings are reported to our IPM Coordinator who evaluates the 8pest problem9 and determines the appropriate pest 
      management techniques to address the problem.  The techniques can include increased sanitation, modifying storage 
      practices, sealing entry points, physically removing the pest, etc. 
       
      From time to time, it may be necessary to use chemicals to control a pest problem.  Chemicals will only be used when 
      necessary and will not be routinely applied.  When chemicals are used, the school will try to use the least toxic products 
      possible.  Applications will be made only when teachers and students do not have access to the area(s) being treated.  
      Notices will be posted in these areas 72 hours prior to application and for two days following the application. 
       
      Parents or guardians of students enrolled in the school may request prior notification of specific pesticide applications  
      made at the school.  To receive notification, you must request to be placed on the school9s 8Notification Registry9.  If  
      you would like to be placed on this registry, please send a signed letter to your child9s principal requesting to be added 
      to the registry.  Each year the district will prepare a new Notification Registry. 
       
      If a chemical application must be made to control an emergency pest problem, notice will be provided by telephone to  
      any parent or guardian who has requested such notification.  Exemptions to this notification include disinfectants and 
      anti-microbial products; self-containerized baits placed in areas not accessible to students, and gel type baits placed in 
      cracks, crevices or voids. 
       
      This letter conforms to the requirements of the Integrated Pest Management Act 35 of 2002 and assures parents and 
      guardians of our commitment to continue providing the safest atmosphere possible for our students.  If you have any 
      questions, please contact Mr. David Catherman, IPM Coordinator at 345-5627.

                       2023-2024 Acceptable Use Policy  
                                 
    Please read the following Acceptable Use Policy carefully before signing the User Agreement in InfoSnap.  
    No account will be created until the User Agreement has been signed and returned. 
     
    New technologies are shifting the ways that information may be accessed, communicated, and transferred.  Those changes may 
    also alter instruction and student learning.  West Branch Area School District offers students and staff members access to the 
    electronic information highway and the Internet. 
     
    Along with access to computers and people all over the world, comes the availability of materials that may not be considered 
    appropriate in the classroom.  However, on a global network it is impossible to control all materials.  Ultimately, the school 
    staff and parents/guardians of minors are responsible for setting and conveying the sources.  West Branch Area School District 
    supports and respects each family9s right to decide whether or not to allow their child to apply for access to the Internet. 
     
    Students are responsible for good behavior on school computer networks just as they are in a classroom or a school hallway.  
    Communications on the network are often public in nature.  General school rules for behavior and communications apply. 
     
    West Branch Area School District Internet is provided for the student to conduct research and communicate with others in 
    relation to school and community work.  Access to network services is given to students who agree to act in a considerate and 
    responsible manner.  Parents/guardians permission is required, by signing the Acceptable Use Policy.  Access is a privilege, not 
    a right. Teachers and the administration will deem what is inappropriate use and provide appropriate sanctions, if deemed 
    necessary.   
     
    Educational Purpose 
    The West Branch Area School District computer network has been established for a limited educational purpose. The term 
    <educational purpose= includes classroom activities and career development activities. The West Branch Area School District 
    computer network has not been established as a public access service or a public forum. The West Branch Area School District 
    has a right to place reasonable restrictions on the material you access or post through the system. You are expected to follow the 
    rules set forth in the Student Handbook, as well as the law, in your use of the West Branch Area School District computer 
    network.  You may not use the West Branch Area School District computer network for commercial purposes. This means you 
    many not offer, provide, or purchase products or services through the network. 
     
    Student Internet Access 
    All students will have access to Internet World Wide Web information resources through their classroom, library, or school 
    computer lab. The District will utilize filtering software or other technologies to prevent students from accessing visual 
    depictions that are (1) obscene, (2) child pornography, or (3) harmful to minors. Educational staff will, to the best of their 
    ability, monitor minors' use of the Internet in school, and will take reasonable measures to prevent access by minors to 
    inappropriate material on the Internet and World Wide Web, and restrict their access to materials harmful to minors. 
     
    Unacceptable Uses 
    Personal Safety. Students/staff will not post personal contact information about yourself or other people. Personal contact 
    information includes your address, telephone, school address, work address, social security number, credit card number, etc. 
    You will promptly disclose to your teacher or other school employee any message you receive that is inappropriate or that 
    makes you feel uncomfortable. Personally, identifiable information concerning students will not be disclosed or used in any way 
    on the Internet without the permission of a parent or guardian. 
     
    Email, Blogging, Chat, and Instant Messaging. Students/staff will not use commercial Web-based mail (Hotmail, Yahoo 
    Mail, etc.) on any school computer, or any type of instant messaging including, but not limited to, AOL Instant Messenger, 
    MSN Messenger, and ICQ. You are not permitted to contribute to weblogs or to be in online Web-based chatrooms unless it is

    network is prohibited.  Such websites include, but are not limited to, MySpace, Xanga, and Facebook. 
     
    Games/Online Games.  The playing of games, including online games, without the consent of the teacher is prohibited.  
    Downloading/saving of any games is also prohibited.   
     
    Illegal Activities. Students/staff will not attempt to gain unauthorized access to the West Branch Area School District computer 
    network or to any other computer system through the West Branch Area School District computer network or go beyond your 
    authorized access (<hacking=). This includes attempting to log in through another person9s account or accessing another 
    person9s files. These actions are illegal, even if only for the purpose of <browsing.= You will not make deliberate attempts to 
    disrupt the computer system or destroy data by spreading computer viruses or by any other means. These actions are illegal. 
    You will not use the West Branch Area School District computer network to engage in any other illegal act, such as arranging 
    for a drug sale or the purchase of alcohol, engaging in criminal gang activity, threatening the safety of a person, etc. 
     
    System Security. You are responsible for your individual account and should take all reasonable precautions to prevent others 
    from being able to use your account. Under no conditions should you provide your password to another person. You will 
    immediately notify a teacher or the system administrator if you have identified a possible security problem.  
     
    Inappropriate Language/Harassment. Restrictions against inappropriate language apply to public messages, private 
    messages, and material posted on Web pages. Students/staff must not use the system to create, send, receive, or use any 
    offensive or disruptive materials or messages. Messages which are considered to be offensive include, but may not be limited 
    to, those which contain sexual implications, racial slurs, gender-specific comments, or any other comments that offensively 
    address someone9s sex, sexual orientation, religious or political beliefs, national origin, or disability. Also considered offensive 
    are messages or materials which are fraudulent, harassing, or obscene, and those which contain abusive, profane, or offensive 
    language. You will not post information that could damage or endanger another9s reputation. You will not engage in personal 
    attacks, including prejudicial or discriminatory attacks. You will not harass another person. Harassment is persistently acting in 
    a manner that distresses or annoys another person. If you are told by a person to stop sending them messages, you must stop. 
    You will not knowingly or recklessly post false or defamatory information about a person or an organization. 
     
    Respecting Resource Limits. Students/staff will use the system only for educational activities. You will not download any 
    files. Loading or use of unauthorized games, programs, files, or other electronic media is prohibited.  No software is to be 
    installed onto the network by students at any time for any purpose. You will not post chain letters or engage in <spamming.= 
    Spamming is sending an annoying or unnecessary message to a large number of people.  Students/staff will be given a set 
    amount of space on the network server to save appropriate/educational data.  Students/staff should periodically review the 
    information saved on their server location and delete any outdated and/or unnecessary information. 
     
    Plagiarism and Copyright Infringement. Students/staff will not plagiarize works that you find on the Internet. Plagiarism is 
    taking the ideas or writings of others and presenting them as if they were yours. You will respect the rights of copyright owners. 
    Copyright infringement occurs when you inappropriately reproduce a work that is protected by a copyright. If a work contains 
    language that specifies appropriate use of that work, you should follow the expressed requirements. If you are unsure whether or 
    not you can use a work, you should request permission from the copyright owner. Copyright law can be very confusing. If you 
    have questions, ask a teacher. 
     
    Inappropriate Access to Material. Students/staff will not use the West Branch Area School District computer network to 
    access material that is profane or obscene (pornography), that advocates illegal acts, or that advocates violence or discrimination 
    towards other people (hate literature). A special exception may be made for hate literature if the purpose of your access is to 
    conduct research and both your teacher and parent have approved. If you mistakenly access inappropriate information, you 
    should immediately tell your teacher or other District employee. This will protect you against a claim that you have 
    intentionally violated this Policy. Your parents should instruct you if there is additional material that they think would be 
    inappropriate for you to access. The district fully expects that you will follow your parents9 instructions in this matter. 
     
    Vandalism.  Vandalism is defined as any malicious attempt to harm or destroy data of another user, hardware or software 
    utilized on the network, hardware or software with any individual device, or other networks that are connected to the West 
    Branch Area School District computer network.  Vandalism by a user will result in immediate cancellation of privileges.  No

    system, and software. 
     
    Future Rules 
    Additional rules and restrictions may be added if the need arises.  Students and staff are responsible for reading and following 
    these rules. 
     
    Security 
    Monitoring 
    The West Branch Area School District reserves the right to log, monitor and review Internet, E-mail and other network use of 
    each user. This logging, monitoring and review may be conducted without cause and without notice. Each user of a West 
    Branch Area School District's computer by the use thereof agrees and consents to such logging, monitoring and review and 
    acknowledges that s/he has no right or expectation of confidentiality or privacy with respect to the Internet, E-mail or other 
    network usage. Network storage areas may be treated like school lockers. Network administrators may review student and staff 
    files and communications to maintain system integrity and ensure that students and staff are using the system only for 
    appropriate purposes. Users should expect that files stored on district servers or computers will not be private.  
     
    Electronic Mail (E-Mail) 
    Users of the network are hereby notified that the West Branch Area School District administration has the authority to intercept 
    and monitor e-mail messages of all persons using the West Branch Area School District computer network. The West Branch 
    Area School District does not recognize the right to privacy of any user or the statements, writings, graphics, e-mail messages or 
    other electronic or video transmissions of any user as a result of access over or through the West Branch Area School District 
    computer network.  All users are bound by the Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986, as amended, and the 
    Communications Decency Act, which prohibit the unauthorized interception or disclosure of e-mail messages by third parties, 
    as well as the appropriateness of certain material being remitted on the Internet. No user shall intercept or disclose any 
    information garnered as a result of access to the West Branch Area School District computer network without the consent of the 
    sender or receiver of the communication. The Act recognizes that the West Branch Area School District may monitor an 
    employee9s e-mail messages, as long as the interception device is included in the e-mail equipment. 
     
    Search and Seizure.  The West Branch Area School District reserves and intends to exercise the right to review, audit, 
    intercept, access, and disclose all uses of the system. The contents of electronic communications may be disclosed within the 
    West Branch Area School District or to law enforcement officials without the permission of the author. You should not assume 
    confidentiality of any material produced. Even when the material is erased from the system, it is usually possible to retrieve that 
    material. Further, the use of passwords for security does not guarantee confidentiality or privacy. Routine maintenance and 
    monitoring of the West Branch Area School District computer network may lead to discovery that you have violated this Policy, 
    the provisions of the Student Handbook, or the law. An individual search will be conducted if there is reasonable suspicion that 
    you have violated this Policy, the provisions of the Student Handbook, or the law. The investigation will be reasonable and 
    related to the suspected violation. Your parents have the right at any time to request to see the contents of your files. 
     
    Due Process. The West Branch Area School District will cooperate fully with local, state, or federal officials in any 
    investigation related to any illegal activities conducted through the West Branch Area School District computer network. If the 
    violation also involves a violation of other provisions of the Student Handbook, it will be handled in a manner described in the 
    Student Handbook. Additional restrictions may be placed on your use of your Internet account. 
     
    District Limitation of Liability.  The West Branch Area School District makes no warranties of any kind, whether expressed 
    or implied, for the service it is providing. The school district is not responsible, and will not be responsible for any damages, 
    including loss of data resulting from delays, non-deliveries, missed deliveries, or service interruption. Use of any information 
    obtained through the use of the West Branch Area School District9s computer network is at the user's risk. The West Branch 
    Area School District disclaims responsibility for the accuracy or quality of information obtained through the Internet or E-mail. 
     
    Filtering.  The West Branch Area School District has provided a filtering solution for the district in compliance with the 
    Children Internet Protection Act, a federal law. Filtering is being done based on certain categories as determined by the 
    administration of the school district. Though filtering is being provided, it is to be considered neither a failsafe system nor a 
    guarantee that all controversial or inappropriate materials are blocked. Students and staff should follow proper procedures and 
    report any sites that may be deemed inappropriate to the computer department so that steps may be taken to block those sites. 
    Users who access inappropriate sites or fail to report unblocked inappropriate sites may find themselves losing their Internet 
    privileges.

    When necessary, the District may call in law enforcement agencies. The district will cooperate fully with local, state or federal

                        West Branch Area School District Elementary School-Wide

                            Local Education Agency Parent and Family Engagement Plan 
                         
      The West Branch Area School District consists of one elementary, one middle school, and one high school. All 
      schools are housed in the same building. The West Branch Area School District is part of the Title I School-
      wide program for West Branch Elementary, Grades K-4. 
      The West Branch Area School District believes that family engagement is critical to the success of its students. 
      To this end, we strive to involve parents and family members in the instructional process, thus helping parents 
      and family members realize the need for school to be a priority in their children9s lives. Together our goal will 
      be to enable our students to be responsible, productive adults, and life-long learners in an ever-changing 
      society. 
      To accomplish these goals, parents and family members will be involved in the joint development, 
      implementation, and review of the Title Consolidate Application. 
      How will the LEA involve parent and family members in the development of the Consolidated 
      Application? 
      An annual meeting will be held in the spring to review the Family Engagement Policy and the upcoming 23-24 
      Consolidated Application. Through the annual meeting, parents and family members will participate in 
      decision-making, budgeting, and monitoring the use of Title funds, as described in the Consolidate Application. 
      How will the LEA involve parent and family members in the school review and improvement? 
      Parents and family members will be involved in the process of school review and improvement by assisting 
      Title 1 staff in the development or revision of school plans that are most likely to improve the performance of 
      participating children in meeting Pennsylvania9s Common Core and State Academic Standards. 
      Parents and family members will be expected to participate in the development of a strong Title 1 program 
      through a school-parent compact. These voluntary agreements define goals, expectations, and shared 
      responsibilities of schools and parents as equal partners for student learning. By doing so, each participant 
      envisions what school should be all about. This continual dialogue between families and school professionals 
      defines what works best for student learning. 
      It is the policy of the West Branch Area School District not to discriminate on the basis of race, color, age, creed, religion, gender, sexual orientation, ancestry, national 
       origin or handicap/disability in its educational programs, activities, or employment. Services and facilities are accessible to and usable by disabled persons as required 
                                      by Title IX, Section 504 and Title VI. 
                                                                              (revised 06/2023)

           How will the LEA provide technical assistance to schools? 
           The district will provide coordination, technical assistance, and other support necessary to the elementary 
           school as it works to implement an effective parent program. Technical assistance could take the form of 
           regional or local workshops involving state and local Title 1 personnel. 
           How will the LEA coordinate with the other federal, state, and local laws and programs? 
           Through joint agency efforts, we will provide materials and training to our parents in areas where needed, such 
           as literacy training and effective parenting skills. These meetings will be offered at various times to meet the 
           needs of the parents. 
           Through joint training activities, the district/school will coordinate and integrate its family engagement 
           programs with other programs such as Head Start and other preschool programs where feasible and appropriate. 
           The school district partners with CenClear to provide four PreK classrooms in house, at no cost to families. 
           How does the LEA evaluate parent and family engagement in all schools? 
           Annually each spring, an evaluation of our Family Engagement Policy will be conducted. These surveys will be 
           distributed to families through communication apps, as well as email, requesting their input as to the 
           effectiveness of our parent program. These questionnaires will request information as to how we can increase 
           parental participation. Furthermore, these questionnaires will be sensitive to such issues as income, parents with 
           disabilities, limited literacy, limited English proficiency, or any other racial or ethnic consideration. Title 1 staff 
           will use the results of these questionnaires to assist in planning a more effective parent program. 
           Through the use of questionnaires, parents will be asked for their input as to the use of funds for family 
           engagement. These questionnaires will be distributed by elementary staff through communication apps. 
           Discussion of the results will be discussed at the annual public meeting. 
           Through the annual evaluation of the Family Engagement Policy, the elementary school will solicit input from 
           parents regarding their dissatisfaction, as well as their satisfaction, with any part of the parent program. All data 
           will be analyzed, and the non-satisfactory parent comments regarding the school9s local plan will be attached to 
           the plan when submitted to the state education agency. 
            It is the policy of the West Branch Area School District not to discriminate on the basis of race, color, age, creed, religion, gender, sexual orientation, ancestry, national

    The West Branch Area Elementary believes that family engagement is critical to the success of its students. To 
    this end, we strive to involve parents and family members in the instructional process, thus helping parents and 
    family members realize the need for school to be a priority in their children9s lives. Together our goal will be to 
    enable our students to be responsible, productive adults, and life-long learners in an ever-changing society. 
    How will the school involve parents and family members in the development of the parent and family 
    engagement policy? 
    To accomplish these goals, parents and family members will be involved in the joint development, 
    implementation, and review of the Title Consolidate Application. 
    Through the annual meeting, parents and family members will participate in decision-making, budgeting, and 
    monitoring the use of Title funds, as described in the Consolidate Application. 
    How will the school meet with parents and family members annually? 
    Two annual meetings will be held, one in the spring and one in the fall, to review the Family Engagement 
    Policy and the upcoming 23-24 Consolidated Application. 
    An annual meeting will be held in the spring to review the Family Engagement Policy and the upcoming 23-24 
    Consolidated Application. 
    What meetings will be held at the school? 
    Annually each spring, an evaluation of our Family Engagement Policy will be conducted. These surveys will be 
    distributed to families through communication apps, as well as email, requesting their input as to the 
    effectiveness of our parent program. These questionnaires will request information as to how we can increase 
    parental participation. Furthermore, these questionnaires will be sensitive to such issues as income, parents with 
    disabilities, limited literacy, limited English proficiency, or any other racial or ethnic consideration. Title 1 staff 
    will use the results of these questionnaires to assist in planning a more effective parent program. 
    How will the school inform parents and family members about the Title I Program? 
    Copy of the Family Engagement Policy will be inserted into the Student Handbook. The Student Handbook 
    must be reviewed and signed off by parents at the beginning of each school year. Additional copies will be 
    provided to parents throughout the year should they request one. 
    Through the WBASD website and other communications, the school encourages parents to become involved in 
    their children9s education and the parent/school partnership and stresses their important role in this home/school 
    effort. 
    Parent/Teacher Conferences will be encouraged to discuss the student9s academic progress. Flexible conference 
    times will be offered to accommodate differing schedules. The Title 1 teacher and Coordinator can be contacted 
                                                               59 
           at any time during the school year. Phone calls to the elementary school secretary at 814-345-5627 will be 
           forwarded to the appropriate staff member. E-mail messages can be sent to the following addresses: 
                                                     Dr. Angela Michaels, Coordinator amichaels@westbranch.org 
                                                     Mrs. Ashley White, Title 1 Teacher awhite@westbranch.org 
            
           How will the school explain the curriculum, state standards, and assessments? 
           Through workshops, speakers, small group sessions, and handouts, parents will gain an understanding of things 
           such as: 
                           a.  National Education Goals 
                           b.  Pennsylvania9s Common Core and State Academic Standards 
                           c.  State and local assessments and the proficiency levels students are expected to meet 
                           d.  Requirements of Title 1 Family Engagement 
                           e.  Ways parents can monitor their children9s progress amd work with educators to improve the 
                                performance of their child(ren) 
                           f.   Ways parents can participate in decisions relating to the education of their child(ren) 
           There will be resource materials available for parents to check out in the elementary school. These materials 
           will support the children in their education and will help parents become full partners in the education of their 
           children. 
           How will the school accommodate meeting requests? 
           The school district will accommodate parents by offering a variety of meeting times, locations, and formats, 
           including early morning and evening hours, phone or zoom sessions, or home visits. The school may offer 
           childcare to families during meeting times, as well as refreshments. 
           How will the school meet with parents and family members to develop and discuss the Schoolwide Plan? 
           Parents and family members will be involved in the process of school review and improvement by assisting 
           Title 1 staff in the development or revision of school plans that are most likely to improve the performance of 
           participating children in meeting Pennsylvania9s Common Core and State Academic Standards. 
           How will the school involve parents and family members in the development of the school-parent 
           compact? 
           Parents and family members will be expected to participate in the development of a strong Title 1 program 
           through a school-parent compact. These voluntary agreements define goals, expectations, and shared 
           responsibilities of schools and parents as equal partners for student learning. By doing so, each participant 
           envisions what school should be all about. This continual dialogue between families and school professionals 
           defines what works best for student learning. 
           How will the school provide training materials to parents and family members? 
           Through joint agency efforts, we will provide materials and training to our parents in areas where needed, such 
           as literacy training and effective parenting skills. These meetings will be offered at various times to meet the 
           needs of the parents. 
           How will the school use parents to train staff on how to work with parents as equal partners? 
                                                                                                                                                                 60 
    The district will work to educate teachers and other staff in how to better relate/communicate to parents. The 
    training will focus on the value and usefulness of parental contributions to the educational process. The focus of 
    these efforts will be to build strong ties between the home and school. The district will utilize materials from the 
    PA Title I State Parent Advisory Council, including skits, to educate and inform parents and staff on 
    collaborative efforts. 
    The district will provide coordination, technical assistance, and other support necessary to the elementary 
    school as it works to implement an effective parent program. Technical assistance could take the form of 
    regional or local workshops involving state and local Title 1 personnel. 
    How will the school coordinate with other federal, state, and local programs to include public preschool 
    programs? 
    The school district partners with CenClear to provide four PreK classrooms. These classrooms include PreK 
    Counts students, Head Start students, and community students. The district promotes the PreK program through 
    social media, flyers, and other news sources. The school district9s literacy coach engages other local preschools 
    by providing training, resources, and materials and holding a PreK council. 
    Through joint training activities, the district/school will coordinate and integrate its family engagement 
    programs with other programs such as Head Start and other preschool programs where feasible and appropriate. 
    How will the school ensure information is in language parents can understand? How will the school 
    include parents and family members of English Learners? 
    Every effort will be made to ensure that information related to schools and parent programs is distributed in a 
    timely manner. Information for meetings and other activities will be sent to the homes of participating children 
    in their appropriate native language. When necessary, local Title 1 personnel will seek the assistance of state 
    department staff in providing full opportunities for the participation of Limited English Proficient parents and 
    parents with disabilities. This assistance will be in the form of providing information and school profiles in the 
    parents9 native language or in a form they can understand.

          Dear Parents/Guardians:  
            
          As a parent or guardian of a student attending a school that is receiving Federal Title I dollars, you have the 
          right to know the professional qualifications of the teacher(s) and instructional paraprofessional(s) who instruct 
          your child.  
            
          Federal law required every Title I school district to comply and to provide you with the requested information 
          in a timely manner.  All schools have on file a listing of faculty members and their professional qualifications.  
          At any time, you may ask:  
               -    whether the teacher met state qualifications and certification requirements for the grade level and 
                    subject he/she is teaching,

     As part of court-ordered services under a voluntary placement or custody agreement. 
       
     A student experiencing foster care may also qualify as a student experiencing educational instability as defined 
     above, if such circumstances apply.[25] 
       
     Enroll or Enrollment means attending classes and participating fully in school activities.[26] 
       
     Additional costs means the difference between what the district spends to transport a resident student to

     Foster care means twenty-four (24) hour substitute care for children placed away from their parents or 
     guardians and for whom the child welfare agency has placement and care responsibility. This includes, but is 
     not limited to, placements in foster family homes, foster homes of relatives, group homes, emergency shelters, 
     residential facilities, child care institutions and pre-adoptive homes. A child is in foster care in accordance with 
     this definition regardless of whether the foster care facility is licensed and payments are made by the state, tribal 
     or local agency for the care of the child, whether adoption subsidy payments are being made prior to the 
     finalization of an adoption or whether there is federal matching of any payments that are made.[25] 
       
     Homeless children and youths means individuals who lack a fixed, regular and adequate nighttime 
     residence, and includes:[26]

     ordinarily used as a regular sleeping accommodation for human beings;

     attending immediately prior to each change in placement.[8] 
       
      When the homeless child or youth, or child in foster care, completes the final grade level served by the school 
     of origin, the school of origin shall become the designated receiving school at the next grade level for all feeder 
     schools. 
       
      Unaccompanied youth means a homeless child or youth not in the physical custody of a parent or 
     guardian. This includes youth who have run away from home; been abandoned or forced out of home by a

     Except when an unaccompanied youth or the parents/guardians of a homeless youth request otherwise, it shall

     the current educational setting, health and safety, and proximity to living arrangements including foster care 
     placement. 
       
     The cost of transportation shall not be used as a factor in the best interest determination. 
       
     Documentation related to the best interest determination shall be maintained in the student9s education 
     record.[29][30]

     The district may disclose personally identifiable information from the education records of a student without 
     written consent of the parent/guardian or the eligible student if the disclosure is:[29][30][39]

     Transportation for Homeless Students - 
       
     The district shall provide transportation for homeless students to their school of origin or the school they choose 
     to attend within the district.[3][10][27] 
       
     If the school of origin is outside district boundaries or homeless students live in another district but will attend 
     their school of origin in this district, the school districts shall agree upon a method to apportion the 
     responsibility and costs of the transportation.[27] 
       
     Transportation for Students in Foster Care – 
       
     The district shall ensure that children in foster care needing transportation to their school of origin promptly 
     receive transportation in a cost-effective manner.[6][10] 
       
      
                                                                       72 
      
      
      
     To ensure that transportation for children in foster care to their school of origin is provided, arranged, and 
     funded, the district shall collaborate with the local children and youth agency to develop a local transportation 
     plan.[6] 
       
     The transportation plan shall address the following:[6] 
       
     The procedure the district and local children and youth agency will follow to provide transportation for children 
     in foster care in a cost-effective manner and in accordance with applicable law.[8] 
       
     How transportation costs will be covered if additional costs are incurred. Options include: 
       
     The local children and youth agency agrees to reimburse the district; 
       
     The district agrees to pay for the cost;[6] 
       
     The district and the local children and youth agency agree to share the costs; or 
       
     The district of origin, the district of foster residence, and the placing children and youth agency agree to share 
     the costs. 
       
     Dispute resolution procedures to ensure that any disagreements regarding the cost of transportation are resolved 
     promptly and fairly, and do not impact a student9s ability to remain in the school of origin during the dispute 
     resolution process. 
       
     The district shall submit the local transportation plan, including any updates or revisions, to the Pennsylvania 
     Department of Education. 
       
     Transportation shall be provided to children in foster care in accordance with the local transportation plan 
     regardless of whether transportation is provided to district students. 
       
     Course Credit and Graduation 
       
     The district shall ensure that each student experiencing educational instability in grades nine (9) through twelve 
     (12) is provided with a graduation plan to facilitate the student9s timely graduation. The graduation plan shall 
     specify the courses and other requirements necessary for the student to graduate. The district9s efforts to ensure 
     that the student experiencing educational instability graduates in a timely manner may include:[4][5][6] 
       
     Waiving a specific course required for graduation if similar coursework has been satisfactorily completed in 
     another school entity or the student has demonstrated competency in that content area. Evidence as to whether 
     coursework has been satisfactorily completed and the amount of full or partial credit assigned, may be 
     determined through any of the following:[4][19] 
       
     Competency demonstration, which could include, but is not limited to: 
       
     Submission of an essay, presentation or project. 
       
     Recognition that the student has already successfully completed a higher-level course, an experiential learning 
     opportunity or internship that demonstrates competence in the content area. 
       
                                                                       73 
      
      
      
      
     Performance on an examination. 
       
     Successful completion of a career and technical education course. 
       
     Other evidence or method determined appropriate by the district. 
       
     If a specific course requirement cannot be waived, the district shall provide an alternative or modified course of 
     study that is currently offered to students and that will assist the student with acquiring the required work or 
     competency requirements by the anticipated graduation date. 
       
     If, after considering full and partial course credits, waiving courses or providing alternative courses of study, the 
     district determines that the student meets the established graduation requirements, the student shall be allowed 
     to participate in the graduation ceremony and graduate with their peers. 
     If the student is determined not eligible for graduation, the district may request a high school diploma from the 
     prior school entity. The prior school entity may issue a diploma if the student meets the prior school entity9s 
     graduation requirements. 
       
     Keystone Diploma – 
       
     In any school year for which demonstration of proficiency on a Keystone exam is required for graduation, a 
     student who has successfully satisfied the graduation requirements may obtain a secondary school diploma 
     known as the Keystone Diploma from the PA Department of Education, if both of the following provisions 
     apply:[4][43] 
       
     All other graduation options have been exhausted. 
       
     The student is unable to obtain a diploma from the student9s prior or receiving school entity. 
       
     The district9s point of contact shall assist the student in determining the student9s eligibility for a Keystone 
     Diploma and, if eligible, obtaining the Keystone Diploma from the PA Department of Education.[4][43] 
       
     Students with Disabilities – 
       
     Students experiencing educational instability who have an IEP shall maintain the right to special education and 
     the right to graduate either through attainment of credits or through the completion of the goals established in 
     their IEP.[11][19] 
       
     Students with an IEP may elect to remain in school until age twenty-one (21) even if the district determines 
     there is an earlier pathway to graduation. Such students may participate in the graduation ceremony with their 
     current graduating class, even if the student elected to remain in school.[19]

       The West Branch Area School District is committed to providing equitable access to services for all students. 
       The following items are included as part of this equity plan: 
        
           ➢ School Accountability Status 
           ➢ School Poverty Percentages (Free/Reduced Lunch)

       The West Branch Area School District receives Title I funding from the United States Department of Education. 
       Therefore, we follow the requirements of the Every Student Succeeds Act (ESSA) of 2015 by developing and 
       implementing an equity plan that ensures our economically disadvantaged and minority students participating in 
       Title programs at the West Branch Elementary School are not being taught at a disproportionate rate by teachers 
       who are inexperienced (less than 3 years of teaching experience, per the PA Department of Education) or who 
       are teaching outside of their certified area.

       West Branch Area School District’s Plan for Hiring, Retaining, and Assigning <Highly Qualified= 
       Teachers  
        
       ESSA defines a <highly qualified teacher= as one who: 
           ●  holds a bachelor9s degree from a four-year institution 
           ●  holds full state certification 
           ●  demonstrates competence in the core academic subjects taught 
        
       Teachers are recruited by posting vacancies on-line, in local and regional newspapers, and by advertising at 
       local colleges of education. If it becomes necessary to hire a teacher who is not appropriately qualified, a plan is 
       developed and closely monitored to ensure that low income and minority students are not taught more 
       frequently than other students by inexperienced teachers. The administration examines data by grade level and 
       subgroup to ensure teachers are assigned to appropriate placements and equitable high-quality instruction is 
       delivered.  
        
       The West Branch Area School District encourages the retainment of highly qualified teachers by offering: 
           ●  Regular professional development sessions led by qualified instructors 
           ●  Tuition reimbursement for college credits associated with instruction or content area 
           ●  Opportunities to attend professional conferences of their choice  
           ●  Competitive wages and benefits commensurate with other local districts 
        
       Parents receive an annual Right to Know letter explaining their right to request information regarding the 
       professional qualifications of their child9s teacher(s) and paraprofessionals.

          Title                     Suspension and Expulsion 
          Code                      233 
          Status                    Active 
          Adopted                   October 24, 2011 
          Last Revised              February 27, 2023 
           
          Purpose 
            
          The Board recognizes that exclusion from the educational program of the schools, whether by suspension or 
          expulsion, is the most severe sanction that can be imposed on a student and one that cannot be imposed without 
          due process. The Board shall define and publish the types of offenses that would lead to exclusion from school. 
          Exclusions affecting students with disabilities shall be governed by applicable state and federal law and 
          regulations.[1][2][3][4][5] 
            
          Authority 
            
          The Board may, after a proper hearing, suspend or expel a student for such time as it deems necessary, or may 
          permanently expel a student.[1][6][7] 
            
          Guidelines 
            
          Exclusion From School - Suspension 
            
          The principal or person in charge of the school may suspend any student for disobedience or misconduct for a 
          period of one (1) to ten (10) consecutive school days and shall immediately notify the parent/guardian and the 
          Superintendent in writing when the student is suspended.[1][7] 
            
          No student may be suspended without notice of the reasons for which the student is suspended and an 
          opportunity to be heard on their own behalf before the school official who holds the authority to reinstate the 
          student. Prior notice is not required where it is clear that the health, safety or welfare of the school population is 
          threatened. Suspensions may not be made to run consecutively beyond the ten-school day period.[1] 
            
          When a suspension exceeds three (3) school days, the student and parent/guardian shall be given the 
          opportunity for an informal hearing with the designated school official. Such hearing shall take place as soon as 
          possible after the suspension, and the district shall offer to hold it within the first five (5) days of the 
          suspension.[1][6] 
            
          Informal hearings under this provision shall be conducted by the building principal and Superintendent. 
            
          Purpose of Informal Hearing 
            
          The purpose of the informal hearing is to permit the student to explain the circumstances surrounding the event 
          leading to the suspension, to show why the student should not be suspended, and to discuss ways to avoid future 
          offenses.[6] 
            
          Due Process Requirements for Informal Hearing[6] 
            
          The student and parent/guardian shall be given written notice of the reasons for the suspension. 
                                                                                                                                               83 
      
    The student and parent/guardian shall receive sufficient notice of the time and place of the informal hearing. 
      
    The student may question any witnesses present at the informal hearing. 
      
    The student may speak and produce witnesses who may speak at the informal hearing. 
      
    The district shall offer to hold the informal hearing within five (5) days of the suspension. 
      
    Exclusion From Class - In-School Suspension 
      
    No student may receive an in-school suspension without notice of the reasons for which the student is 
    suspended and an opportunity to be heard prior to the time the suspension becomes effective. The 
    parent/guardian shall be informed of the suspension action taken by the school.[2] 
      
    Should the in-school suspension exceed ten (10) consecutive school days, the student and parent/guardian shall 
    be offered an informal hearing with the building principal. Such hearing shall take place prior to the eleventh 
    day of the in-school suspension. The procedure shall be the same as the procedure for informal hearings held in 
    connection with out-of-school suspensions.[2][6] 
      
    The district shall provide for the student's education during the period of in-school suspension.[2] 
      
    Expulsion 
      
    Expulsion is exclusion from school by the Board for a period exceeding ten (10) consecutive school days. The 
    Board may permanently expel from the district rolls any student whose misconduct or disobedience warrants 
    this sanction. No student shall be expelled without an opportunity for a formal hearing before the Board, and 
    upon action taken by the Board after the hearing.[1][6][7] 
      
    Expulsion Hearings 
      
    A formal hearing shall be required in all expulsion actions.[1][6][7][8] 
      
    The formal hearing shall observe the due process requirements of:[6] 
      
    Notification of the charges in writing by certified mail to the student's parent/guardian. 
      
    At least three (3) days' notice of the time and place of the hearing, which shall include a copy of this policy, 
    hearing procedures and notice of the right to representation by legal counsel. A student may request the 
    rescheduling of the hearing when the student demonstrates good cause for an extension. 
      
    The hearing shall be private unless the student or parent/guardian requests a public hearing. 
      
    Representation by counsel at the parent's/guardian's expense and parent/guardian may attend the hearing. 
      
    Disclosure of the names of witnesses against the student and copies of their written statements or affidavits. 
      
    The right to request that witnesses against the student appear in person and answer questions or be cross-

    A written or audio record shall be kept of the hearing and a copy made available to the student at the student's 
    expense, or at no charge if the student is indigent. 
      
    The hearing shall be held within fifteen (15) school days of the notice of charges, unless a delay is mutually 
    agreed to by both parties or is delayed by: 
      
    The need for laboratory reports from law enforcement agencies. 
      
    Evaluations or other court or administrative proceedings are pending due to a student's invoking their rights 
    under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA). 
      
    Delay is necessary due to the condition or best interests of the victim in cases of juvenile or criminal court 
    involving sexual assault or serious bodily injury.

    additional conditions or sanctions.[9] 
      
    Attendance/School Work During Suspension and Prior to Expulsion 
      
    Students serving an out-of-school suspension must make up missed exams and work, and shall be permitted to 
    complete assignments pursuant to established guidelines.[1][10] 
      
    Students who are facing an expulsion hearing must be placed in their normal classes if the formal hearing is not 
    held within the ten-school day suspension. 
      
    If it is not possible to hold the formal hearing within the first ten (10) school days, the school district may 
    exclude such a student from class for up to five (5) additional – fifteen (15) total – school days if, after an 
    informal hearing, it is determined that the student's presence in their normal class would constitute a threat to 
    the health, safety or welfare of others. 
      
    Any further exclusion prior to a formal hearing may be only by mutual agreement. Such students shall be given 
    alternative education, which may include home study. 
      
    Attendance/School Work After Expulsion 
      
    Students who are under eighteen (18) years of age are still subject to compulsory school attendance even though 
    expelled and shall be provided an education.[1][10][11] 
      
    The parent/guardian has the initial responsibility of providing the required education and shall, within thirty 
    (30) days, submit written evidence to the school that the required education is being provided or that they are 
    unable to do so. If the parent/guardian is unable to provide for the required education, the school district shall, 
    within ten (10) days of receipt of the parent's/guardian's notification, make provision for the student's education. 
      
    The Board may provide an educational program to the student immediately upon expulsion and may waive the 
    30-day period, at its discretion.

    A student with a disability shall be provided educational services as required by state and federal laws and 
    regulations and Board policies.[12][13] 
      
    Delegation of Responsibility 
      
    The Superintendent or designee shall develop administrative regulations to implement this policy which 
    include: 
      
    Publication of a Code of Student Conduct, in accordance with Board policy on student discipline. [14] 
      
    Procedures that ensure due process when a student is being deprived of the right to attend school. 
      
    Regulations regarding student records which require that records of disciplinary suspension be maintained in 
    accordance with Board policy on student records.[15][16] 
      
    The name of a student who has been disciplined shall not become part of the agenda or minutes of a public 
    meeting, nor part of any public record of the Board. Such students may be designated by code. 
      
    Any student who has been expelled may apply for readmission to school upon such conditions as may be 
    imposed by the Board.
