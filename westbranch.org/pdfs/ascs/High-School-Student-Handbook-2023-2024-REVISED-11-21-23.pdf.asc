        PRINCIPAL'S MESSAGE 
        Dear Parents and Guardians, 
         
        This handbook is intended to provide a brief, concise, and understandable overview of some of the most important 
        opportunities, general rules, guidelines, policies, and expectations about our high school.  It is not intended to be all 
        inclusive; its contents may be subject to change.  Please take the time to review this handbook thoroughly as it can be an 
        important source of information for both students and parents.  Your questions and concerns are important to me; 
        therefore, please contact me as needed.  In addition, the other administrators, faculty, and staff are here to help as well, 
        so call upon any of them at any time.  It is important to me that the school and community form a strong alliance.  Get 
        involved where and when you can.  With mutual respect and support, we can make anything possible. 
         
        Sincerely, 
         
        Brandy F. O9Hare

          FID (Flexible Instructional Days) 
           
          During the 2023-2024 School Year, West Branch Area School District will be utilizing Flexible Instruction Days (FIDs) 
          which may be used in place of a school day that would be canceled because of inclement weather or another emergency 
          situation. On a FID, students will complete learning activities and assignments provided by their teachers. Implementing 
          a FID will not require additional make-up days when school is canceled. The District can use up to five (5) FIDs per school 
          year. Students and parents/guardians will be informed of a FID through the District's notification systems in the same 
          way that school closings and delays are currently announced.  
                                                                             9

         internet may log on to Google Classroom to access assignment information.  Students are expected to complete all 
         lessons during the FID day. Students will submit/return their assignments upon their return to school the next day.  Any 
         student who fails to complete their FID assignments on their FID day, will be marked as absent unexcused from school

         Remote Learning Guidelines and Etiquette 
          
         During remote learning sessions, the following guidelines will be in effect.  In an effort to create a positive and 
         productive environment for all learners: 
                                                                        
             •   Students must attend the class, remote session, and return digitally when directed, and/or complete the 
                 asynchronous learning activity. 
                                                                     10 
              •   Students must have their video on during the entire class session to be considered present, unless formal 
                  arrangements have been made with the teacher. 
              •   Attendance is required at all sessions. Staff will take attendance. 
              •   Recording of live lessons is prohibited. Any use of a teacher or other students9 images is always inappropriate.

         CTC Students – 2 Hour Delay 
         The AM students of the CTC will depart as close to 9:55 AM as possible in order to arrive at the CTC at their usual time.  
         They will report directly to the CTC bus upon their arrival to school.  Attendance will be done at the CTC.  All AM CTC 
         students will return to WB at 11:40 and should report directly to their 5th period class as indicated by their individual 
         schedule.  The PM CTC students will be reported to 3rd period just like everyone else and leaving for the CTC at their usual 
         time.  If there are any changes to the current plans, all of the students will be notified.   
          
         CTC Students – Activity Day/Pep Assembly  
         The departure and the return times for the AM students will remain the same.  Upon return, the AM students would 
         report to their 5th period class or to B Lunch depending on their respective schedules. 
          
         The PM students who are staying for the pep rally will be assigned to rooms after they have attended their 5th period class 
         and lunch.  Those PM students choosing to attend the CTC will depart at 11:30 AM. 
          
         CTC Students – Attendance 
         The CTC places a high priority on instructional time in which a student is actively engaged in learning while in attendance 
         in the classroom or lab; therefore, it is imperative that each student strive to maintain a good attendance record while 
         enrolled in one of the programs.   
          
         Students from the West Branch HS can be excused from the CTC throughout the school year for events such as pep rallies, 
         assemblies, or make up work.  Athletic events and academic related functions (Envirothon, etc.) are excused as applicable.   
         Students must receive approval if they want to remain at the home school for the day.  Approval to stay all day at the CTC 
         must be granted by principals at both schools (CTC and WB).  Academics at both schools will be a big factor in the decision 
         to grant approval. 
          
         All unexcused absences at the CTC are recorded by the teacher and the student receives a zero for that day.    
          
         Expectations for Activity Day Meetings 
         Students are to report for meetings when they are scheduled.  Likewise, students who leave a class to attend a meeting 
         must be a member of the club and/or be included on the roster that is sent to teachers prior to activity day events.  If you 
         leave a class under false pretenses, you may be subject to disciplinary referral.  Sometimes a student will have more than 
         one meeting scheduled at the same time.   
                                                                           11 
    Unfortunately, the student will have to choose which meeting to attend and then be sure to see the advisor for the one 
    that is missed.  When the meetings are completed, the students are to go directly back to class or move on quickly to their 
    next meeting.   
     
    Expectations for Pep Assemblies 
    Students will be dismissed to go to assemblies and pep rallies via the public address system.  At the appropriate time, 
    students should move quickly and quietly to assigned areas in the auditorium or gym with their teacher.  All students must 
    sit in their assigned area and be monitored by their teacher.  Failure to comply with these requests will be treated as 
    insubordination.  Appropriate behavior is expected at all times. Appropriate behaviors include, but are not limited to: 
    •   Demonstrating respect for the speakers or presenters. 
    •   Listening attentively while the performers are addressing the audience. 
    •   Sitting in an appropriate manner, keeping feet off chairs and out of the aisles. 
    Disruptive students will be removed by administrators or teachers and may receive further disciplinary consequences. 
                                 
     
    GENERAL POLICIES AND PROCEDURES 
    Announcements 
    Announcements will occur specifically at 8:00 AM and again at approximately 2:35 PM.  Any class, club, or organization 
    wanting to have an announcement read must present the announcement, written legibly, and signed by the advisor of 
    the activity, to the office secretary in order to be approved by the principal for reading.  In order to ensure that an 
    announcement is approved, it is advisable to submit it as early as possible.  Unapproved requests will not be read during 
    the scheduled announcement times. 
     
    In addition to the normal daily announcements, classes, clubs, athletics, and organizations frequently request permission 
    to post announcements in the high school to advertise numerous activities. Permission to post these announcements 
    throughout the school must be obtained from the office of the principal prior to putting up any items in the high school. 
     
    Special announcements concerning cancelations or postponements of athletic events or extra-curricular activities will be 
    completed through emails.    
     
    Arrival to School in the Morning 
    All students in 5th through 12th grade, arriving by bus, driving, or being dropped off, shall enter the high school through 
    the three sets of double doors nearest the main office unless being dropped off by a parent.   
     
    Parent drop-off for students will be in the rear of the building at the set of doors beyond the band room - door #29.  Once 
    the student has exited the vehicle, parents will need to continue around the back of the building and exit the property on 
    the elementary playground side.  
      
    The doors will be unlocked at 7:35. Once allowed into the building, HS students shall report to the HS cafeteria.  MS 
    students shall report to the library.  Students will be released from those locations at 7:43 to report to their homerooms.  
     
    If students arrive prior to 7:35 they are to wait outside of the rear door, or they may go to the front main entrance of the 
    school and wait inside between the double set of doors.  The exterior doors will be unlocked but the doors leading into 
    the school itself will remain locked until 7:35.  
     
    Students consistently arriving prior to 7:35 can be dropped off at the front door and wait in the lobby area accordingly.  
    After 7:35 no students are permitted to be dropped off at the front of the school because it interferes with the buses. 
                               12 
      Attendance – Senior Privilege 
      Seniors must obtain prior approval from the high school principal before early dismissal or late arrival privileges can 
      begin.  A student with a job may leave after 5th period providing, they have scheduled all of their graduation 
      requirements and are on track for graduation.  If a student leaves the job for whatever reason, the student has two 
      weeks to secure another job or return to school.   
       
      For senior students without a job, they can obtain approval for early dismissal or late arrival if they have a study hall at 
                                                                                  st
      either the beginning of the day or at the end of the day.  No students will be dismissed for periods of time in between 1  
      and 8th period.  All students seeking approval must meet academic and attendance standards.  Students who violate 
      behavior, academic, or attendance expectations and guidelines may have their privilege suspended or revoked 
      indefinitely.   
       
      NOTE: No juniors will be allowed to arrive late or leave early because of work and/or study hall at the beginning or the 
      end of the day, respectively.   
       
      Athletic Events 
      Good sportsmanship is learned, practiced, and executed. Respect for the opponent, spectators, coaches, and officials are 
      a must at all levels of athletics.  At interscholastic contests, behavior on the part of everyone should be characterized by 
      generosity and genuine concern for others.  
      Students who attend any athletic event at West Branch Area HS are not to display any unsportsmanlike conduct toward 
      officials and/or any opposing players, spectators, or coaches.  Doing so will result in an immediate suspension from the 
      event with possible disciplinary action for future events. This includes inappropriate comments, gestures, profanity or any 
      behavior of any kind that could be considered disrespectful. 
       
      Authority Statement 
      All students shall comply with directions of the administrators, teachers, substitute teachers, bus drivers, or any other 
      school official whenever a student is under the authority of the school.  All students shall demonstrate proper respect 
      toward all school officials and must comply with all reasonable directives from such officials. 
       
      NOTE: Students having assessments as a result of policy violation must comply by those recommendations at parental 
      expense or be subject to exclusion from school.  A timetable will be set. 
       
      Breakfast  
      West Branch HS offers a grab and go breakfast each regularly scheduled day from 7:50 to 8:00.  Students may eat breakfast 
      in the lunchroom or on the way to class.  Please throw all of your trash in the proper containers that are located in the 
      hallways.  Students are permitted to eat during the opening of class (approximately 5-7 minutes).   
       
      Bus Notes 
      West Branch Area SD may provide transportation to/from an alternate location, provided there is room available on the 
      route and the following guidelines are met: 
      1.  The alternate location is consistent five days per week for morning and afternoon.  Alternative locations will remain 
      the same for at least one semester.  Example:  Student may be transported from one location to school in the AM and 
      from school to another location in the PM.

                                            13 
         Cafeteria 
         The cafeteria is for the convenience of every student.  In addition to the school discipline code, students are to adhere to 
         the following: 
          
      •    Please properly dispose of trash.                             •   Students may not have food delivered from local 
      •    Please keep your table area clean.                                restaurants. 
      •    Please remain in your assigned seating area.                  •   Please be respectful of others. 
      •    Throwing food, paper, or other items is unacceptable and 
           will result in disciplinary action. 
          
         The goal of cafeteria services is to provide nutritious meals, within USDA-approved guidelines, to promote optimum 
         student performance in the classroom. Menus are posted in the cafeteria and circulated throughout classrooms and 
         offices. Menus are also posted on the school9s web page (www.westbranch.org). 
          
         At West Branch, students may choose whether or not to participate in lunch meal programs. The cafeteria provides meals 
         via an offer versus serve system.  Under this system, the student may decide not to select any one of the five lunch items 
         required to be served on the menu.  A-la-carte food and drink items are sold in the cafeteria daily. Students must have a 
         positive balance in order to purchase a-la-carte items. 
          
         Teachers and/or monitors are responsible for maintaining an orderly and pleasant atmosphere in the cafeteria. Shouting, 
         unnecessary moving around, and boisterous behavior which interferes with a climate conducive to good eating habits and 
         a comfortable environment for all are not permitted. 
          
         Meal Prices and Procedures 
         For the 2023-2024 school year, breakfast and lunch are free for students. The district promotes good nutrition and 
         wellness by providing breakfast and lunch to students as a part of the Community Eligibility Provision program (CEP) in 
         compliance with the National School Lunch Program, School Breakfast Program.  The CEP program provides a healthy 
         breakfast and lunch each school day at no charge for all students enrolled during the school year. This program does not 
         include second meals and a la carte purchases, however, these are available for an additional cost. Meal and a la carte 
         pricing can be found on the district9s website. 
          A computerized pre-pay accounting system maintains student accounts and meal data. Students are to bring or parents 
         may send payments of cash or checks payable to West Branch Cafeteria for deposit into individual student accounts. 
         Payments should include name, homeroom, and amount enclosed to ensure accuracy. Payment boxes are provided in 
         the office and cafeteria and must be deposited by 8:00 AM to ensure same day credit.  These accounts are debited as 
         students purchase meals, milk, a-la-carte, etc.   
         Students are to report to the cafeteria at their designated lunch time.  As they pass through the food line, they will select 
         a tray and be able to add food items.  Items selected in addition to the regular menu will be charged by the computer 
         operator.  Each student enters their pin number. The transaction is entered into the computer and the student9s individual 
         account is debited.  
          
         Students are encouraged to bring in payments without excessive reminders. Parents should keep records at home so 
         payments can be sent in a timely manner. This reduces paperwork and time spent maintaining the system. Individual 
         student account information is available upon request. We encourage payments to be made in the form of a check.  This 
         ensures that we can track your child9s payments.  Cash payments are not traceable.  Large amounts of change must be 
         rolled.  We will not accept large amounts of loose change.  A $25.00 fee plus banking charges will be charged for any 
         returned checks. 
          
                                                                           14 
         As a matter of standard practice, refunds for account balances over $2.00 after the end of the school year are processed 
         for students who withdraw or graduate. The school reserves the right to initiate legal action for unpaid negative account 
         balances.  Students with negative account balances of $5.00 or more will also not be allowed to participate in 
         extracurricular activities (i.e. clubs, sports) or field trips, and may lose parking or other privileges, until the balance is 
         paid in full.  Referrals and/or other consequences will be given to those in violation of the above. 
                                                                             
         *Payments may be made in varying amounts, which may fit each household9s financial circumstances. Any questions or 
         concerns can be addressed by calling 345-5627 and asking to speak with cafeteria staff. 
          
         Cell Phones / Electronic Devices 
         The West Branch Area HS recognizes the usefulness of cellular telephones and other devices as a means of supplementing 
         educational instruction under staff supervision.  Any unauthorized use of electronic devices will result in disciplinary 
         action.  Headphones or earbuds being used in class without permission are a violation as well.   
          
         Students may use a cell phone / electronic device under the following conditions:

         Students may not use a cell phone / electronic device: 
              •   During instructional time (classrooms – study halls are considered instructional time). 
              •   Without administrative and/or teacher approval.

         Computers such as notebooks, Kindles, Nooks, and iPads are ok in cooperation with teacher or administrative permission.  
         Students are encouraged to use the school wireless internet when using these devices.  It will be faster than airtime data 
         and save on home cell phone plan data being used. 
          When a device is in use in the classroom, students will not: 
              •   Answer an incoming SMS (text) message or phone call 
              •   Be on any social media site (Facebook, Twitter, etc...) for personal usage

         Due to the evolving nature of emerging technologies, additional rules and regulations may be added throughout the school 
         year.    
          
         NOTE:  Any electronic communication device used to create a hostile situation such as cyber-bullying or sexting or any 
         other type of inappropriate communication conduct may merit the confiscation of a cell phone/device and be used/held 
         as evidence for an extended period of time pending the alleged misuse of the device and appropriate disciplinary action. 
          
                                                                           15 
    Clubs 
    At West Branch HS, students can be actively involved in many ways.  Besides academic work and interscholastic sports 
    activities, there are a number of organized clubs that students can join.  Students will be encouraged and required to 
    choose a club(s) to attend during monthly activity days.  Students will not be required to attend any club related functions 
    outside  of  activity  day.    Parents  or  guardians  can  decline  permission  for  their  student(s)  to  belong  to  any 
    club(s).  Exemption can be completed by the parent or guardian by indicating it in writing to the high school principal.  
     
    Dismissal 
    School is dismissed at 2:40 PM unless otherwise directed. Students who ride the bus should report immediately to the bus 
    while those who walk, or drive should leave the school as soon as possible.  After 2:40 PM, all students should vacate the 
    premises unless they are under the immediate supervision of a teacher, coach, chaperone, or advisor.  Students are not 
    permitted to congregate on school property without supervision.  Those students who remain must sit in the main lobby 
    until their ride arrives.  Any unsupervised student who is in an area other than the main lobby can be subject to disciplinary 
    actions.   
     
    Students being excused during the school day are to exit the building through the main office doors after signing out.   
     
    Driving / Parking (see also Arrival to School in the Morning) 
    All students in 5th through 12th grade, driving or being dropped off, are to enter the high school through the three sets 
    of double doors nearest the main office. 
    Please understand that driving on school property is a privilege and safety is vital; therefore, those who do not follow the 
    driving  guidelines  listed  in  this  section  will  immediately  lose  their  driving/parking  privileges  and/or  incur  other 
    consequences.  A student can also lose driving/parking privileges for not parking in his/her assigned spot, as well as for 
    other offenses.   
     
    Parking Spaces 
    Students will be assigned to spaces in the front of the building as much as possible.  After being assigned a parking 
    space, a student is to continue to use that space unless given permission by the administration to do otherwise.  If you 
    arrive to find your parking space taken, please notify the principal.  Likewise, please do not park anywhere but your 
    assigned space during school hours.  Students are not to be parking in the church lot.   
     
    Access to Vehicles during the Day 
    Students are not permitted to go out to their vehicle during the school day without the permission of the principal.  In 
    general, students must wait until the end of their school day to go out to their vehicles.   
     
    Clearfield County Career and Technology Center 
    No student may drive to the C.C.C.T.C. without the permission of the principal from West Branch and the C.C.C.T.C.   
     
    NOTE: 
    Off road motor vehicles such as snowmobiles, dirt bikes, ATV9s are prohibited on school property at any time. 
     
    Financial Obligations 
    All  student financial obligations must be satisfied before receiving a report card and/or being able to participate in 
    graduation services at the end of the year. Students must pay the replacement value for lost or damaged books. No 
    student will be able to participate in graduation services from WBHS who has not met all financial obligations such as 
    cafeteria debt, payment for library or test books, project costs, or replacement costs of damaged school property. 
     
                               16 
    Fundraisers 
    When a student participates in a fundraiser under any of the Activity Clubs in West Branch HS, the parent will write one 
    check to the club for payment of all items ordered.  The payment can also be made in cash or money order. Receipts will 
    be given upon request. If a check is returned for insufficient funds, the parent must pay back the amount of the check plus 
    a $25.00 West Branch fee and a $10.00 bank fee for a total of $35.00.  This fee must be paid in the form of cash or a money 
    order to the West Branch HS before the student9s order will be placed.  If a check is returned insufficient, then parent 
    checks will no longer be able to be used for that student.  Any future fundraisers will have to be paid in cash or by money 
    order.  These rules apply only to Activity Clubs within the school; outside booster clubs have their own set of rules 
    regarding fundraisers. 
     
    Hall Lockers 
    Lockers are assigned for each student.  All students must keep books, coats, hats, backpacks, bags, and other belongings 
    in their own locker.  Any student backpack, bag, purse, etc. that is carried into a class must be able to fit under the 
    desk/chair in that classroom so that it doesn9t block any walkway or present a hazard to others.  Athletes, musicians, etc. 
    with bags or cases too large for the locker or to be carried class to class must be stored in a designated area.  For example, 
    many athletes will take a larger bag to a coach9s room to store for the day.  Band students take their instruments to the 
    band room or place in a designated area as directed by the band director. 
     
    The school provides students with hall lockers and locks but assumes no responsibility for the safe-keeping of the contents 
    of the lockers.  Lockers must be kept locked at all times.  Valuables should not be left in lockers.  If necessary, students 
    may store valuables in the high school office during the day and pick them up after school.  In the event that your locker 
    or lock is not functioning properly to protect your items, it is your responsibility to inform Mr. Williamson in a timely 
    manner.  He will see that the locker or lock is fixed or that you are assigned a new locker. 
     
    Students and parents are reminded that lockers remain the property of the West Branch Area School District.  There is no 
    right to privacy extended to any student concerning his/her locker.  The school district and its officials reserve the right to 
    inspect and search a student's locker at any time and remove any object or material which is illegal, contrary to school 
    rules, or which may be detrimental to the school or student.  Such materials may be used as evidence against the student 
    in disciplinary, juvenile, or criminal proceedings.  Prior to a locker search, the student may be notified and given the 
    opportunity to be present; however, when such authorities have a reasonable suspicion that a locker contains materials 
    which pose a threat to the health, welfare, and safety of students/staff/visitors in the school, the locker may be searched 
    without the student's presence.  The school assumes no responsibility for student's belongings stored in a hall locker. 
     
    Each student will be provided a combination lock for use on his/her locker.  Students are responsible to return their locks 
    at the end of the school year.  Students are responsible for not sharing their combination or locker with others and 
    ensuring the lock is kept locked.  Students losing locks may choose to purchase a second combination lock through the 
    office at a cost of $5.00.  The $5.00 fee will be charged to any student not turning in the assigned lock at the end of the 
    school year.   
     
    Health Office Policies 
    1) Students are to report to the nurse if they are ill, have an injury, or need to be evaluated for health reasons.  Students 
    may not use a cell phone or school building phones to call their parents to leave for health problems.  If students use a 
    cell phone or building phone to contact their parents without approval from the nurse, the absence will be unexcused.   
    Students must be evaluated, and dismissed by the nurse if medically necessary to leave school due to illness, injury, or 
    other health reasons.  A parent can choose to take his/her child to the physician to get a doctor9s excuse if the parent 
    wishes for the absence to be considered an excused absence.  However, the student must be evaluated by the physician 
    the day the student left school and the excuse returned per the student handbook9s absence procedures.  To be in 
    compliance with attendance requirements, if a student has already missed 10 days or more and he/she leaves school due 
    to illness or injury, a doctor9s excuse is needed for that absence from the school day.  The school nurse is not able to 
    provide the excuse for any student with excessive absences.   
                               17 
     
    2) Please do not send your child to school and ask the nurse to diagnose your child9s health problem or previous injury.  
    The nurse is not a physician, and under the Nurse Practice Act is not allowed to diagnose health conditions.  In addition, if 
    your child had an injury on a previous day, and is unable to participate in gym class; the school nurse cannot excuse the 
    student from gym class.  A doctor9s excuse is required.   
     
    3)  Delivery and Storage of Medications – Policy 210.  
    All  medication shall be brought to the nurse9s office, or the main office if the nurse is in another building, by the 
    parent/guardian or by another adult designated by the parent/guardian. All medication shall be stored in the original 
    pharmacy-labeled container and kept in a locked cabinet designated for storage of medication.  
    Medications that require refrigeration shall be stored and locked in a refrigerator designated only for medications. The 
    district shall not store more than a thirty-day supply of an individual student9s medication. 
    Medication should be recorded and logged in with the date, name of student, name of medication, amount of medication, 
    and signatures of the parent/guardian or designated adult delivering the medication and the school health personnel 
    receiving the medication. 
    Nonprescription medication must be delivered in its original packaging and labeled with the student9s name. 
    Prescription medication shall be delivered in its original packaging and labeled with: 
    1.  Name, address, telephone and federal DEA (Drug Enforcement Agency) number of the pharmacy. 
    2.  Student9s name. 
    3.  Directions for use (dosage, frequency and time of administration, route, special instructions). 
    4.  Name and registration number of the licensed prescriber. 
    5.  Prescription serial number. 
    6.  Date originally filled. 
    7.  Name of medication and amount dispensed. 
    8.  Controlled substance statement, if applicable. 
     
    All  medication  shall  be  accompanied by a completed Medication Administration Consent and Licensed Prescriber9s 
    Medication Order Form, or other written communication from the licensed prescriber. 
     
    4)  Each student must have a completed emergency card, updated yearly, on file in the health office.  See the Info Snap 
    section of the handbook.  Only persons designated on the emergency card may pick up students from school if the nurse 
    is unable to reach the student9s parent/guardian.  If the student does not turn in an emergency card for the current school 
    year, and the nurse is unable to reach his/her parent/guardian, the student will not be allowed to leave the school building 
    with anyone other than the parent/guardian.  Parents:  If possible, please include at least one other contact person who 
    is able to drive to pick up the student if needed. 
     
    5) Health History Forms will be passed out to students yearly, are available in the health office, and available to download 
    from the school nurse9s webpage.  It is very important to update this form yearly and return it to the nurse so the nurse is 
    aware of any health problems that may impact your child during the school day.  If you choose not to indicate that your 
    child has any health problems, we ask that you still sign and return the form so that the nurses know that you received it.  
    If you, the parent/guardian, would like any teacher, bus driver, or any other staff member to be made aware of your child9s 
    health problems, it is your responsibility to notify them.   
    The nurse will not routinely share this information except in an emergency situation or if the nurse determines that an 
    employee has an immediate need to know for the welfare of your child.  In addition, if you notify the teacher of your 
    child9s health condition, and you would also like the nurse to be made aware of the same, it is your responsibility to notify 
    the nurse. 
     
    6) All students must abide by the school health law and have the required health screenings and immunizations completed 
    for that grade.  Dental exams are mandatory for students in grades K, 3, and 7.  Physical exams are mandatory for students 
    in grades K, 6, and 11.  For dental and physical exams, parents have the option of either having a school dental/physical 
                               18 
    exam free of charge, or taking their child to their private dentist/physician at their expense, and returning a copy of the 
    exam to the school nurse prior to the date of the school screening/exam.  Private physical and dental forms are available 
    in the nurse9s office and available to download from the school nurse9s webpage.  Vision, Height, Weight, and Body Mass 
    Index (BMI) screenings will be done yearly as required by law.  Hearing Screenings will be done for students in grades K, 
    1, 2, 3, 7, and 11 as required by law.  Scoliosis screenings will be done for all 7th grade students as required by law.  
    Students who do not submit required immunization and health screenings paperwork by the deadlines set by the district 
    will be excluded from school until the paperwork is submitted to the school nurse. 
     
    7)  Students are not permitted to be in school with lice.  If a student is found to have lice during the school day, the parent 
    will be contacted and the child will be sent home.  Students will also be sent home if nits (lice eggs) are found and the 
    student was not recently treated with a lice shampoo.  It is the parent/guardian9s responsibility to properly treat the lice, 
    and return the student to school the next school day to be checked by the school nurse.   If the student does not return 
    to school the next school day because of lice, the student will only be excused for the day the student was sent home by 
    the nurse.   
     
    8)  Please address hygiene issues with your children at home.    
    Please be aware that children can be sensitive to odors, such as odors from animals that may linger on clothing, chemicals, 
    perfumes, and personal body odor.   
     
    9)  Extra clothes – The nurses recommend that all students carry an extra set of clothes in their backpacks or store in 
    lockers.  Many times, extra clothes are needed for reasons such as bowel or bladder accidents, menstrual problems, 
    muddy/wet clothes, or food spills.  
     
    10) Temperature checks – The District reserves the right to conduct temperature checks upon arrival for all employees, 
    students, and visitors throughout the school year and as warranted by increased illness 
     
    Homework / In-Class Work 
    Students at West Branch HS are to complete all assignments when they are due.  Students must assume responsibility to 
    produce original work, arrange to complete any missed assignments, ask for additional help when needed, and put forth 
    reasonable effort.  In addition, students should bring their laptops to class on a daily basis. 
     
    Immunizations 
    The Pennsylvania Department of Health regulations require that all students attending school must be fully immunized.  
    All  students  must  comply  with  the  requirements of the State Immunization Code (28 PA Code, Ch 23).  Complete 
    immunization records must be delivered to the school prior to a students9 acceptance for enrollment.  The only exceptions 
    to these regulations are those students for whom immunization is not medically advisable, those for whom immunization 
    is contrary to religious or moral convictions, and students who qualify for admission to school under the auspices of the 
    McKinney Vento Act regarding homelessness.  Students who are not fully immunized will be prevented from entering 
    school.   
     
    InfoSnap 
    InfoSnap is an online, cloud-based, student registration system.  This system allows parents to fill out student forms via 
    the Internet.  Please locate the InfoSnap link on the district website at http://www.westbranch.org in order to locate the 
    necessary documents.  If you are unable to access InfoSnap from home, the school will be open at specific times through 
    late summer and early fall for the purpose of assisting families with the process of entering the information.   All other 
    information regarding this program, including tutorials, will be found on the school website. Parents/guardians are 
    required to provide the district with this information annually using the district system.  Letters will be sent indicating the 
    due date for completion.  Failure to complete the work by the due date will result in loss of privileges. 
     
                               19 
          Insurance 
          A student accident insurance program is available to all students.  All students participating in interscholastic athletics 
          programs are required to have student insurance or furnish proof of comparable coverage with another company.  
          Students participating in other school activities are encouraged to have insurance. 
           
          Internet Services 
          The West Branch Area School District (WBASD) Acceptable Use Policy outlines all of the regulations governing the WBSD 
          computer network.  Students and their parents/guardians must read the WBSD Acceptable Use Policy, as well as the WBSD 
          Acceptable Use Policy User Agreement.   
           
          The  WBSD  Acceptable  Use  Policy  User  Agreement  must  be  completed  and  signed  by  both  the  student  and  the 
          parent/guardian and then be returned to school.  A computer account for the student will not be created until the 
          Acceptable Use Policy User Agreement is completed and signed by both parties and returned to school.  A copy of the 
          West Branch Area School District Acceptable Use Policy will be distributed during the first week of school and will be 
          available online at the school website.  In addition, the school district will educate all students about appropriate online 
          behavior, including interacting with other individuals on social networking websites and in chat rooms and cyberbullying 
          awareness and response. 
           
          Library Services 
          The high school library has an extensive fiction collection.  Among the collection, you can find popular series and recent 
          literary award winners.  Our non-fiction collection includes titles that are high-interest and also books chosen specifically 
          to address assignments such as research papers.  To aid in locating books, there is an online catalog that is available at 
          school or at home.   
           
          West Branch is a member of the AccessPA system, so students have access to the resources of the Power Library, including 
          AskHere PA.  We also subscribe to the Ebscohost database, where one of the favorite items for our students is a readers9 
          advisory service called Novelist. Students can use it to find suggestions of other books similar to books they have enjoyed, 
          or perhaps identify the next book in a series.  Ebscohost includes a full periodical database as well as Consumer Health, 
          Auto Repair, History Research Center and others.  It is available to students for home use by accessing the Ebscohost link 
          on the West Branch High School Library website. 
           
          Make-up Work 
          Students will be given the opportunity to make up missed work and tests after any absence.  The following guidelines 
          should be used for make-up work:  
           
          1.       It is the responsibility of the student, upon returning to school, to contact the teacher for make-up work and to 
          complete that work.  
          2.       It is the responsibility of each teacher to provide make-up work for absences.  
          3.       A student will be given a reasonable amount of time for make-up work.  Generally, a student will be given two 
          days after a single day9s absence and five days after two or more days absent, unless the student was already aware of 
          the assignment. Teachers may use their discretion to further extend the amount of time for make-up work.  
          4.       If a student fails to complete a test/assignment that has been rescheduled by a teacher due to an absence, the 
          grade automatically becomes a zero and the teacher should contact the parents. 
          5.       If a student arrives late to school, he or she is responsible for contacting the teacher that day to take any test 
          scheduled or submit work due that day.  
          6.       Students may make up all work missed during a suspension from school within the allotted time established 
          above.  
           
                                                                                20 
    Outstanding Obligations to the District 
    The West Branch Area School District reserves the right to restrict participation in extracurricular activities if students have 
    any outstanding obligations to the district.  Examples would include overdue lunch account balances, overdue library 
    books, vandalism, fundraising debts, etc.  Participation in extracurricular activities and field trips will be restored when all 
    obligations have been fulfilled. 
     
    Permission to Leave Class 
    A student may receive permission to leave a classroom by obtaining a pass from his/her teacher.  It is up to each teacher 
    to decide whether or not to allow a student to leave his/her class. 
    1.  Locker passes should only be issued in special situations.  Students should go to class each day with all necessary 
    materials and should not leave that class to get or put away classroom materials.   
    2.  Restroom passes will be issued by the classroom teacher.  Students are to have a pass in order to go to the restroom.   
    3.  Students are not permitted to leave the building or go to the elementary or middle school without written permission 
    from the principal.   
     
    eHallpass 
    The West Branch Area Jr/Sr. High and Middle school utilize the eHallpass system.  Any time students leave for the 
    classroom, they must first enter a pass and have it approved.  Teachers may also fill out passes when requesting 
    students for various reasons.  Passes must be started and ended when appropriate.  Auto passes may be created for 
    bathroom and water fountain use.  However, students must still seek permission before starting their pass.  It is the 
    student9s responsibility for ending an auto pass.   
     
    Any excessive hallway activity by a student will be investigated. 
     
    Physical Education 
    Students at West Branch Area HS are required to participate and pass physical education classes as mandated by the 
    Pennsylvania Department of Education.  A change of clothes is required when participating in the physical education 
    classes and should include appropriate dress for both indoor and outdoor activities.  In addition, athletic shoes are 
    required.  Jewelry is not permitted in any physical education class.  Students should not bring valuables to the locker room 
    or to class.  The Physical Education staff is not responsible for lost or stolen items.  Due to privacy expectations of others, 
    students are not to use electronic devices in the locker rooms.  
     
    When a student is unable to participate in regular physical education classes for a physical or other compelling reason, a 
    doctor9s excuse will be submitted to the PE teacher.  The excuse will give the nature of the injury or illness, length of time 
    to be excused from regular physical education classes, and a description of the activities in which the student can 
    participate.  We will also accept notes from our athletic trainer. For medical absences longer than two weeks, the school 
    reserves the right to assign an alternate physical activity.  The school nurse will seek clarification in order to define the 
    best course of action for the student.  If an alternative physical activity is not able to be worked out, the student will work 
    on a computer health class, or a teacher approved assignment until he/she is able to return to class.   
     
    Physical Education Jewelry Policy 
    Introduction 
    This Physical Education Jewelry Policy has been established to provide guidelines for students who wish to wear jewelry 
    during physical education classes. While jewelry is generally allowed, it is essential to ensure the safety and well-being of 
    all students. Therefore, parents and guardians will be held liable for any potential injuries or damages resulting from the 
    wearing of jewelry during physical education activities. 
     
     
                               21 
    Policy Guidelines 
     
    1. Permission to Wear Jewelry: Students are permitted to wear jewelry during physical education classes. However, it is 
    encouraged to keep jewelry to a minimum to minimize potential risks. 
     
    2. Safety Considerations: Students must consider the potential safety risks associated with wearing jewelry during physical 
    activities. It is strongly recommended that students remove any jewelry that may pose a risk, such as dangling or sharp-
    edged items. Jewelry that may interfere with safe and effective participation in physical education activities should be 
    taken off. 
     
    3. Liability: Parents and guardians of students are solely responsible for any injuries or damages resulting from the wearing 
    of jewelry during physical education classes. The school and its staff will not be held liable for any accidents or incidents 
    involving jewelry worn by students. 
     
    4. Notification and Consent: Before the start of the school year, parents or guardians will be informed of this policy and 
    its implications. They must provide written consent acknowledging that they understand the risks associated with wearing 
    jewelry during physical education activities and that they will assume liability for any potential injuries or damages. 
     
    5. Storage of Jewelry: Students are responsible for the safe storage of their jewelry during physical education classes. The 
    school will not be held liable for lost or stolen jewelry. It is advisable to use lockers or designated storage areas for valuable 
    items. 
     
    6.  Regular  Monitoring:  The  physical  education  instructor  will  regularly  remind  students  about  the  policy  and  the 
    importance of adhering to safety guidelines regarding jewelry. They will also have the authority to address any safety 
    concerns during physical education activities. 
     
    This Physical Education Jewelry Policy aims to strike a balance between allowing students the freedom to wear jewelry 
    while participating in physical education classes and ensuring the safety and well-being of all students. By providing clear 
    guidelines and involving parents and guardians in the decision-making process, we aim to create a safe and inclusive 
    learning environment for all students. It is essential for parents and guardians to understand the risks involved and accept 
    liability for their child's choice to wear jewelry during physical education activities. 
     
    Physical Education Dress Code 
     
    The following dress code is established to ensure the safety, comfort, and optimal participation of all students in physical 
    education classes. Please adhere to these guidelines when selecting your attire for physical education sessions: 
     
    General Guidelines: 
     
    1. Athletic Attire: Students are required to wear appropriate athletic attire suitable for physical activities. This includes 
    sportswear that allows for ease of movement and breathability. 
     
                               22 
         2. Footwear: Athletic shoes (Sneakers) with non-marking soles and proper support are mandatory. Sandals, flip-flops, 
         crocs, and open-toed shoes are not allowed for safety reasons. 
          
         3. Weather Considerations: Dress according to the weather conditions. In colder weather, students may wear additional 
         layers, such as sweatshirts or long-sleeved athletic shirts. 
          
         4. Medical Conditions: If a student has a medical condition that requires specific attire or accommodations, they should 
         provide a doctor's note outlining the necessary modifications. 
          
         This dress code is implemented to promote a safe and inclusive environment in physical education classes, allowing all 
         students to engage comfortably and participate fully. It is essential to follow these guidelines to ensure the well-being and 
         safety of everyone involved in physical activities. If you have specific concerns or require accommodations, please contact 
         your physical education instructor in advance. 
          
         Privileges  
         There are many privileges available to students during their time in high school.   Students in good academic and 
         disciplinary status can participate in clubs, sports, school dances, field trips, pep rallies, and be able to obtain on-site 
         parking passes.  Any one of these privileges or others not listed may be revoked by the school administration, coach, or 
         advisor if a student9s academic, social behavior, and/or school attendance warrants such an action.  In some instances, 
         students can regain privileges through consistent demonstration of improved conduct and performance. 
          
         Safe2Say 
         Safe2Say Something is a youth violence prevention program run by the PA Office of the Attorney General.  The program 
         teaches youth and adults how to recognize warning signs and signals, especially within social media, from individuals who 
         may be a threat to themselves or others and to say something before it is too late.  With Safe2Say Something, it is easy 
         and confidential to report safety concerns to help prevent violence and tragedies. 
         Submit an anonymous tip report through the Safe2Something system via the phone application (Safe2Say Something PA) 
         or at the tip line number: 1-844-SAF2SAY. 
          
         Student Handbook 
         The student handbook will be available online for viewing.  It contains important rules, policies, and procedures pertaining 
         to our school.  Parent sign off will be completed online via the Info Snap program.  Copies of the student handbook can 
         be printed from the webpage or issued at the request of the parent. 
          
         Study Hall Procedures 
         The following general procedures are followed for study halls: 
         •    Permission to talk or work together must be obtained from the teacher in charge of the study hall. 
         •    Students must have study hall material with them when they arrive.  Passes to lockers are issued only on rare 
              occasions. 
         •    Students should be quiet throughout the study hall.  
         •    Game playing (i.e. cards, checkers) is prohibited.  
         •    Students should utilize study hall time effectively. It is expected that students use this time for study or homework. 
         •    Students must have a pass signed by a teacher to be permitted to leave a study hall. 
         •    All students leaving study hall to go to another location in the building are required to go by the most direct route.  
              Failure to do so can result in being considered out of assigned area or a misuse of pass.  Restrictions may be 
              assigned by the study hall teacher including loss of privileges. 
         •    Study hall teacher may grant permission for a student to use a cell phone for school purposes. 
                                                                           23 
    Appointments to see specific teachers should be made in advance and scheduled during non-instructional times. 
     
    Threat Assessment Team 
    The West Branch Area School District has a Threat Assessment Team. The team includes the Safe School Safety Security 
    Coordinator, Building Principals, Building Counselors, School Police, and Special Education Supervisor.  
    A Threat Assessment Team is <a multidisciplinary group of individuals identified by a chief school administrator responsible 
    for the assessment of and intervention with students whose behavior may indicate a threat to the safety of the student, 
    other students, school employees, school facilities, the community, or others.=  
     
    Telephone Usage 
    Students needing to use the phone for emergencies may get a pass from their study hall teacher to the office.  The Principal 
    will determine if it is an emergency (forgetting homework is not an emergency).   
    If either party allows the student to use the phone, the student will complete a log.  The student must fill out the log 
    before the phone call is placed.  Students are not permitted to call home to have their parents come and pick them up.  
    Students who are not excused by the nurse or the office will be considered to be absent unexcused.   
     
    Textbooks 
    All basic textbooks are loaned to the students for their use during the school year and are to be kept clean and handled 
    carefully.  Textbooks must be covered if required by the classroom teacher.   Any student losing or damaging a textbook 
    will be required to reimburse the school district the amount of the replacement cost.  Textbooks should be kept in a locked 
    locker when not being used to avoid loss or theft. 
     
    Video Surveillance 
    To ensure the safety of all students and visitors, the high school building is equipped with video cameras and recording 
    devices.    All  students  and  visitors  who  enter  the  high  school  building  acknowledge  that they  are  subject  to  video 
    surveillance  upon entering  the  building.    These  recordings  may  be  used  as  evidence  against  the  student/visitor  in 
    disciplinary, juvenile, or criminal proceedings.   
     
    NOTE: According to Board Policy 810.2, the West Branch Area School Board authorizes the use of video and audio 
    recording on school buses and school vehicles.  The West Branch Area School Board prohibits the use of audio recording 
    on any school bus or school vehicle that is not being used for a school-related purpose. 
     
    Visitors 
    All persons who wish to visit West Branch Area High School must report directly to the High School Office and register 
    their presence and receive a name tag.  When leaving, the visitor will return to the office and check-out at the kiosk.

                                                          Other Graduation Requirements 
         In addition to credits, the following requirements must also be met to be eligible for graduation: 
          
         Act 158 and State Testing (Keystone Exams) 
         The Keystone Exams are end-of-course assessments designed to evaluate proficiency in academic content. The Keystone 
         Exams serve a dual purpose. 
          
         Students must demonstrate proficiency on the Algebra I, Literature, and Biology Keystone Exams as a pathway to graduate. 
         Students will be offered multiple opportunities to take the Keystone Exams throughout their high school careers.  
          
         Act 158 was signed into law by Governor Tom Wolf on October 24, 2018. This legislation addresses high school 
         graduation requirements and how the Keystone Exams along with other pathways factor into these requirements 
         for students graduating in 2023 and later. Students must meet one of the five graduation pathways outlined below 
         to graduate and earn their diploma by demonstrating their readiness that they are career and/or college ready. 
          
         Keystone Proficiency Pathway: Requires students to score proficient or advanced on each Exam—Algebra I, 
         Literature, and Biology.  
          
         Keystone Composite Pathway: Requires students to earn a satisfactory composite score of 4452 on the Algebra I,

    Procedures and Expectations for Students on Overnight Trips 
    The West Branch Area School Board is supportive of our student groups when requesting overnight trips. These trips many 
    times allow for greater competition and the opportunity for our students to learn and/or improve their skills. We also 
    understand that there are many more risks for our students9 safety. To help keep our students safe the following 
    procedures and expectations will be in effect. 
      1.  Rules:  All school rules apply during overnight trips. School rule violations preceding the trip may result in the 
        denial of attending the trip. Coaches/advisors will review these rules with students before the trip departs. 
        Students are reminded that they must respect each other and that there must be no bullying, harassment, 
        hazing, fighting, or other misconduct. Students should report any misconduct immediately to a coach/advisor. 
        The staff will be even more vigilant about enforcing school rules on the trip and students will face serious 
        disciplinary action for any misconduct. Students are expected to remain in their rooms at the direction of their 
        coach/advisor and/or chaperone at all times. Violations will result in administrative review. Following the 
        review, disciplinary action up to and including removal from the team/student group will be administered. 
        Violations relating to drugs, alcohol, and/or weapons will result in an immediate call to the appropriate 
        authorities. 
      2.  Supervision: The coaches/advisors and their assistants/chaperones must supervise students whenever possible 
        during the trip, including in the middle of the night. Students are expected to adhere to all directives given by 
        coaches/advisors and/or chaperones. 
      3.  Searches: Searches of students9 personal property, purses, briefcases, backpacks, and bags will be conducted if 
        there is reasonable suspicion that a student is violating school rules or the law. These searches may occur at any 
        time; before, during, and/or after the trip. Coaches/advisors and/or chaperones will be in contact with 
        administration during the search process. 
      4.  Release of Student: If a student has violated the law, such as by possessing drugs, alcohol, or a weapon, in 
        addition to calling the authorities, parents may be requested to retrieve their child from the trip. In the event of 
        parent/guardian refusal to retrieve their child from the trip, any associated costs to return the student will be 
        the responsibility of the parent/guardian. 
     
                            ATTENDANCE 
    GENERAL ATTENDANCE POLICY INFORMATION 
    Upon the student9s return to school after an absence, a written excuse must be brought from home explaining the reason 
    for your absence.  Excuses for absence should be taken to the attendance window during homeroom.  The student must 
    submit an acceptable excuse within three (3) days of their return to school.  If the student does not submit an acceptable 
    excuse within three (3) days of his/her return to school, the day(s) will result in an illegal absence if the student is 16 years 
                               32 
         of age or younger or an unexcused absence if the student is 17 years of age or older.  THE DAY(S) WILL NOT BE CHANGED 
         IF AN EXCUSE IS BROUGHT IN AFTER THE THREE (3) DAY PERIOD.  
         Students who are eighteen or older, who live at home and are enrolled in school, remain the responsibility of their 
         parents/guardians  until  graduation.  All  excuses,  dismissals,  and  permission  slips  must  be  signed  by  their 
         parents/guardians.

                                                                                (written excuse required) 
          
         Early Dismissal 
         Early dismissal will be granted under certain conditions for medical appointments.  When requesting an early dismissal, a 
         written request must be presented to the office at least one (1) day in advance of the requested day.  If a request is not 
         presented at least one (1) day in advance the parent/guardian will be required to come to the school and sign the student 
         out.  Parents must report to the office before picking up a student.  Students are responsible for all work missed due to 
         an early dismissal.   
          
         At the scheduled early dismissal time, the student must report to the main office.  Students must exit the building at the 
         front entrance by the main office.  The school asks that parents pick up the student at this entrance only.   
         All students, regardless of age or where they have chosen to park their vehicle, must adhere to this policy unless there is 
         a compelling reason for a modification as determined by the principal or his designee. 
          
                                                                        th
         Students who are dismissed prior to the completion of 4  period will be marked a full day absent if they do not return to 
         school.  If the student returns to school and is present in the building for at least 3 ½ total hours, the student will only be 
         marked as ½ day absent.  Students who leave after 4th period will be marked a ½ day absent. 
          
         NOTE: A student must have a valid reason to be excused early from school.  If a student does not have a valid reason for 
         dismissal, the absence will be counted as an unexcused absence.  If a student has an early dismissal for a doctor 
                                                                           33 
         appointment, the student must provide a physician9s note within three (3) days of their return to school for the excuse to 
         be counted as an excused absence.  If a doctor9s note is not received within three (3) days, the absence will be considered 
         unexcused/illegal. 
          
         Examples of unexcused/unlawful absences include: 
         Shopping  trips,  babysitting,  fishing/hunting,  missing  the  bus/  oversleeping,  haircuts, employment,  senior  pictures, 
         educational trips/vacations (not approved in advance), and leaving the building without signing out in the office.   
          
         Attendance Violations 
         Attendance violations include late to class, late to school, unexcused class absences (including class cuts and leaving school 
         grounds without permission). Class cutting and leaving school grounds without permission are clear cut violations and will 
         be dealt with by administration. 
          
         Unexcused Tardies to School 
         Any class periods missed will be treated as class absences and will count towards the 15/24 Day Rule.  
          
         Students will have three (3) days to bring in an excuse for being tardy to school. If a valid excuse is not submitted within 
         three days, the tardy will be marked unexcused/illegal. The day the student is tardy is counted as day 1 of the 3.   
          
         Excused Tardies to School (with legal excuse) 
         Students will be warned for infractions 1-4 if they present a legal excuse.  After the fourth, a doctor9s note will be required; 
         otherwise, they will be counted as unexcused. 
          
         NOTE:  Students who arrive late, but do not sign in at the main office and get a late slip, will be charged with an 
         illegal/unexcused absence.  
                                                                             
         Tardy to Class 
         A student is considered tardy for a class if he/she is less than five (5) minutes late for that class.  Tardies are cumulative.  
         Being late for any class period adds to the cumulative total. 
          
         If the student is more than five (5) minutes tardy for class, the tardy will be considered an unexcused absence from class 
         (class cut).

         are determined to need specially designed instruction due to the following conditions: 
          
             1.  Autism/pervasive development disorder 
             2.  Blindness or visual impairment 
             3.  Deafness or hearing impairment 
             4.  Developmental delay 
             5.  Mentally gifted 
             6.  Intellectually disabled 
             7.  Multi-handicapped 
             8.  Neurological impairment 
             9.  Other health impairments 
                     •   Physical disability 
                     •   Serious emotional disturbance 
                     •   Specific learning disability 
                     •   Speech and language impairment 
          
         If you believe that your school-age child may be in need of special education services and related programs, or your child 
         (age 3 to school-age) may be in need of early intervention, screening, and evaluation processes designed to assess the 
         needs of the child and his/her eligibility are available to you at no cost, upon written request. You may request screening 
         and evaluation at any time, whether or not your child is enrolled in the District9s public-school program. Requests for 
         evaluation and screening are to be made in writing to the principal or special education supervisor. 
          
         In compliance with state and federal law, the West Branch Area School District will provide to each protected handicapped 
         student without discrimination or cost to the student or family, those related aids, services or accommodations which are 
         needed to provide equal opportunity to participate in and obtain the benefits of the school program and extracurricular 
         activities to the maximum intent appropriate to the student9s abilities. In order to qualify as a protected handicapped 
                                                                      38 
    student, the child must be school age with a physical or mental disability that substantially limits or prohibits participation 
    in or access to an aspect of the school program. These services and protections for <protected handicapped student= are 
    distinct from those applicable to all eligible or exceptional students enrolled (or seeking enrollment) in special education 
    programs. 
     
    For further information on the rights of parents and children, provision of services, evaluation and screening (including 
    purpose time and location), and rights to due process procedures, you may contact the special education supervisor. 
     
    Student Assistance Program (SAP) 
    The Student Assistance Program is a team of professionals working together to provide help for adolescents who are 
    experiencing problems.  Alcohol and other drug abuse, disruptions at home, depression, pressure from peers, trouble at 
    work, loss of a loved one, or many other factors can lead a student to feel alone and hopeless.  The cause may differ, but 
    the result is usually the same - the student9s problems interfere with educational process - a student who is troubled 
    struggles to learn. 
     
    SAP Team: 
    It is the parent's right to be involved in the process and to have full access to all school records under the applicable state 
    and federal laws and regulations.  Involvement of parents in all phases of the student assistance program underscores the 
    parent's role and responsibility in the decision-making process affecting their child's education and is key to the successful 
    resolution of problems. 
    A student can be referred to the program by parents, teachers, and/or friends.  This can be accomplished by contacting 
    any SAP team member.  From there, a referral is made for an interview with the student and parents, if necessary, to gain 
    information about the students and the nature of the problem.  The information gathered is confidential.  The evaluation 
    service is at no cost to the family or student.  We are here to help! 
     
    STUDENT RECORDS 
    Disclosure 
    School districts are permitted to disclose student records to state or local officials within the juvenile justice system.  
    School districts may also release records concerning disciplinary action taken against a student for conduct that posed a 
    significant risk to the safety or well-being of that student or to other members of the school community without prior 
    consent.  However, such disclosures should be limited only to those teachers or school officials who have a <legitimate 
    educational interest in the behavior of that student.=  
     
    Review 
    Students (18 years of age) and parents/guardians of students under age 18 have a right to inspect and review a student9s 
    educational records by contacting the Guidance Office and scheduling a time for the review.  
     If the student and/or parent find inaccurate or misleading information he/she should request, in writing, that the Principal 
    review the inaccurate or misleading information and consider altering the same.  No personal information will be disclosed 
    without prior approval except as stated in the previous section <Disclosure=. 
     
    Complaints  regarding  compliance  with  the  Federal  Educational  Rights  and  Privacy  Act  may  be  filed  with  the  U.S. 
    Department of Education. 
     
    STUDENT CONDUCT 
    It  is  the  belief of the West Branch School Board, Administration, Faculty, and Staff that our school will maintain an 
    environment that will allow continuous and uninterrupted learning. 
     
                                  39 
      The school policies relating to discipline are reasonable and intended to benefit the safety of our school.  Every student 
      has the right to an education and no student has the right to take this opportunity away.  Every student has been able to 
      review a Student/Parent Discipline Handbook, which explains each discipline policy.  Discipline sanctions will be addressed 
      in  the following ways: Detention, In-School Suspension, Out-of-School Suspension, Friday School, and/or Alternative 
      Education Program.  Refer to the Discipline Sanction Chart. 
       
      School Rules 
      The School Board has the authority to make reasonable and necessary rules governing the conduct of students in school. 
      The rule making power however is not unlimited; it must operate within statutory and constitutional restraints. 
         
      1.  A School Board has only those powers enumerated in the laws of the State, which may reasonably be implied or 
        necessary for the orderly operation of the school. 
      2.  School Boards may not make rules which are arbitrary, capricious, or outside their authority granted by the General 
        Assembly.  Rules must stand the test of fairness and reasonableness.  A rule is generally considered reasonable if it 
        uses a rational means of accomplishing some legitimate school purpose. 
      3.  School rules are assumed to be reasonable until they are rescinded or waived.  Students, therefore, should obey 
        school rules even while working through appropriate channels to change those rules that seem unfair. 
      4.  All rules and regulations also apply when students are participating in any extracurricular activity. 
      5.  The Administration shall have the right to formulate other rules, regulations, and disciplinary actions that it deems 
        necessary to conduct a well-disciplined, safe and orderly school. 
      6.  In the event of a violation of great severity or a violation which includes physical assault, fighting, intimidation, 
        and/or serious threats, steps preceding suspension or expulsion may be bypassed. 
       
      Detention 
      Detention will typically be held from 2:45 – 3:45 PM, Monday through Friday as needed.  Students are expected to serve 
      detention on the assigned day.  Students may change the day of a detention one (1) time with written or verbal notification 
      from a parent/guardian.  An additional day of detention will be assigned for failure to attend on the scheduled day or 
      failure to bring work materials with them. If a second skipped detention occurs, the student will receive two (2) additional 
      hours.  A third skipped detention will result in loss of all extracurricular activities and hall pass privileges until all detention 
      hours have been served.  Hours not served by the end of the school year will be carried over to the following school 
      year.  The student will be on the Loss of Privilege List (loss of extracurricular activities, hall passes, etc.) until all hours 
      have been made up and served (after the start of the new school year).   
       
      Friday School 
      Friday School will be held from 2:45 – 5:45 PM on assigned Fridays.  ALL STUDENTS MUST ARRIVE PROMPTLY AFTER SCHOOL TO THE 
      ASSIGNED ROOM AND HAVE TRANSPORTATION HOME AT 5:45 PM.  Students must bring school work to do.   
      Failure to bring school work or to work on school work will result in an additional assignment to Friday School, as well as 
      Out of School Suspension.  Failure to attend Friday School will result in an additional day assigned, as well as Out of School 
      Suspension.  Failure to report a 2nd time will result in Out-of-School Suspension, a mandatory parent meeting, and a 
      possible hearing for expulsion. 
       
      In-School Suspension (ISS) 
      Students who have ISS must report to the designated ISS room at the beginning of first period.  Students must have all 
      necessary materials (books, etc.) when they arrive at the ISS room.  Students must work on their assignments and are not 
      permitted to talk.  A formal list of rules is posted in the ISS room and must be followed at all times.  Students are to submit 
                st
      phones to the 1  period teacher.  Cell phone usage in ISS is prohibited and is considered insubordinate behavior.  Students 
      who violate ISS/school rules will be disciplined.  Failure to complete any assigned class work could result in a 0% for that 
      assignment.  Students will be dismissed with the bell at the end of the school day (2:40). 
                                            40 
     
     
     
     
    Out of School Suspension (OSS) 
    Students who receive OSS are not permitted on school property during the length of their suspension.  If the suspension 
    includes Friday, the student is not permitted on school property over the weekend.  The student is not permitted to 
    participate in any extracurricular activities during the length of the suspension (including weekends if the suspension 
    includes a Friday).  At the student or parent9s request, the guidance office will attempt to furnish assignments.  Students 
    are still responsible for all work. 
     
    Loss of Privileges 
    A student9s school privileges may be revoked for a period of time due to negative behavior and/or attendance issues.  This 
    could include, but is not limited to, restrictions from attending school assemblies and/or functions (dances, sporting 
    events, etc.), loss of parking privileges, restriction from participating in school trips not of a purely educational nature, 
    restriction from holding a student office, restriction from participating in extracurricular activities and group and athletic 
    programs, and loss of membership in school related organizations.    
     
    Searches and Seizures 
    To maintain order and discipline in the schools and to protect the safety and welfare of students and school personnel, 
    school authorities may search a student, student9s locker and desk and may seize any illegal, unauthorized or contraband 
    materials discovered in the search.  Student desks and lockers are school property and may be searched at any time by 
    authorized school officials.  Periodic inspections of lockers and desks may be conducted at any time by school personnel 
    without notice. 
     
    Students9 personal effects (book bag, purse, athletic bag, etc.), as well as a motor vehicle parked on school property, may 
    be searched if there is a reasonable suspicion to believe that illegal or unauthorized materials may be found, or that the 
    student is violating law, school board policy or school rules, or poses a threat to the student or the school population.  
    Searches conducted by the administration may include, but not be limited to, utilization of certified drug dogs or any 
    device used to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the student and the school population.  A student9s failure to 
    permit searches and seizures could result in a 5-day suspension and possible police contact. 
     
    Bullying / Cyberbullying 
    Policy 249 – adopted October 24, 2011 
    The West Branch Area School District Board of School Directors is committed to providing all students with a safe, healthy, 
    and civil school environment in which all members of the school community are treated with mutual respect, tolerance, 
    and dignity. To that end, the school district has in place policies, and practices that are designed to reduce and eliminate 
    bullying and harassment when they occur.  
     
     
    This policy is in effect while students are on property within jurisdiction of the school district; while on school-contracted 
    or school-operated vehicles; and while attending or engaged in school-sponsored activities. Students who file a bullying 
    complaint or who have assisted or participated in any manner in a bullying investigation may not be retaliated against.  
    Any violation of this policy shall be considered an infraction of the Code of Conduct, with discipline implemented 
    accordingly. All bullying behavior that is a violation of the PA Crimes Code will be reported to the appropriate legal 
    authorities. 
    The Board encourages students who have been bullied to promptly report such incidents to the building principal or 
    designee. 
     
                               41 
          Bullying shall mean an intentional electronic, written, verbal or physical act, or series of acts: 
          1.  Directed at another student or students. 
          2.  Which occurs in a school setting. 
          3.  That is severe, persistent or pervasive. 
          4.  That has the effect of doing any of the following: 
          a.        Substantially interfering with a student9s education. 
          b.        Creating a threatening environment. 
          c.        Substantially disrupting the orderly operation of the school. 
           
          School setting shall mean in the school, on school grounds, in school vehicles, at a designated bus stop, or at any activity 
          sponsored, supervised, or sanctioned by the school.  
           
          Bullying, as defined in this policy, includes cyberbullying. 
          The Superintendent or designee shall develop administrative regulations to implement this policy. 
          This policy shall be implemented through the cooperative efforts of the Superintendent, building administrators, school 
          staff members, parents/guardians, regional police and state police, and the school district9s community.  
          Each staff member shall be responsible for maintaining an educational environment free from bullying. Staff members 
          who observe or become aware of an act of bullying shall take immediate, appropriate steps to intervene unless the 
          intervention would be a threat to staff members9 safety. In that case, or if the bullying persists, s/he shall report the 
          bullying  to  the  school  principal  for  further  investigation.  This  investigation  may  include  interviews  with  students, 
          parents/guardians, and school staff; review of school records; and any other appropriate means of investigation. 
          The Board expects that students and parents/guardians who become aware of an act of bullying shall report it to a school 
          official (usually the building principal) for further investigation. Any student who retaliates against another person for 
          reporting bullying, intimidation and/or physical assault shall be subject to further disciplinary action.  
          Students shall be informed about the policy on the district9s publicly accessible Internet web site, and in every classroom. 
          The policy shall be posted at a prominent location within each school building where such notices are usually posted. Each 
          school building principal shall ensure that the policy and procedures for reporting bullying incidents are reviewed with 
          students at least once each school year. 
          The Superintendent or designee, in cooperation with other appropriate administrators, shall review this policy every three 
          (3) years and recommend necessary revisions to the Board. 
           
          District administration shall annually provide the following information with the Safe School Report: 
          1.  Board9s Bullying Policy. 
          2.  Report of bullying incidents. 
          3.  Information on the development and implementation of any bullying prevention, intervention or                                
          &&education programs. 
          4.  The Code of Student Conduct, which shall contain this policy, shall be disseminated annually to students. 
           
          This policy shall be accessible in every classroom. The policy shall be posted in a prominent location within each school 
          building and on the district web site, if available. 
           
          Preventive Measures 
          A copy of this policy will be included in the student handbooks annually. Teachers, counselors, specialists, and school 
          administrators will routinely discuss bullying with students and will provide appropriate examples to assist students with 
          recognizing, identifying, and reporting bullying incidents. All students shall be informed that bullying will not be tolerated 
          in any form. All students shall be encouraged to report any bullying regardless of whether they are the victim or an 
          observer. 
          When an investigation substantiates that bullying has occurred, the building principal or assistant principal shall inform 
          staff who work with the offending student and the victim about the bullying so that those staff can more closely monitor 
          for future incidents of bullying. The primary purpose of such action is to protect the victim and deter such behavior in the 
                                                                                  42 
          future. The disciplinary action imposed on the offender will match the severity of the offense. 
           
           
           
          Reporting Procedures 
          All students who believe they have been the victim of bullying shall promptly report the bullying incident to a teacher, 
          counselor, or building administrator. 
          All parents/guardians are encouraged to report the bullying incident(s) to a building administrator. 
          Any teacher/counselor who witnesses bullying or receives a report of bullying shall document such incident and promptly 
          investigate the matter. After the investigation has been completed, the building principal shall take appropriate actions 
          consistent with this policy. 
          Disciplinary and Other Actions 
          A student who violates this policy shall be subject to appropriate disciplinary action consistent with the Code of Student 
          Conduct, which may include: 
          1.       Counseling within the school. 
          2.       Parental conference. 
          3.       Loss of school privileges. 
          4.       Exclusion from school-sponsored activities. 
          5.       Detention. 
          6.       Suspension. 
          7.       Expulsion. 
          8.       Board Hearing 
          9.       Referral to law enforcement officials. 
           
          If an investigation substantiates that bullying has occurred, a written record of the incident shall be placed in the file of 
          the offending students(s). Parents/Guardians of the offending students will be encouraged to attend one (1) or more 
          conferences with an administrator to review the bullying behavior and cooperative strategies for correcting it. The building 
          principal or designee shall also inform the victim9s parents/guardians of any and all bullying incidents involving their child. 
          Disciplinary action shall be in accordance with the Board approved Code of Student Conduct depending on the severity of 
          the offense. If the investigation has determined that the conduct rises to the level of a crime, disciplinary action may also 
          include referral to law enforcement officials.  
           
          All incidents of confirmed bullying, shall be recorded in writing and placed in the offending student9s discipline file. 
          The penalties and prohibitions in this policy are in addition to, and do not replace or supersede, any related provisions in 
          district policy prohibiting conduct such as harassment, violence, assault, and hazing. 
           
          Controlled Substances / Paraphernalia 
          Policy 227 – adopted October 24, 2011 
          The Board recognizes that the abuse of controlled substances is a serious problem with legal, physical and social 
          implications for the whole school community. As an educational institution, the schools shall strive to prevent abuse of 
          controlled substances. 
           
          For purposes of this policy, controlled substances shall include all: 
          1. Controlled substances prohibited by federal and state law. 
          2. Look-alike drugs. 
          3. Alcoholic beverages. 
          4. Anabolic steroids. 
          5. Drug paraphernalia. 
          6. Any volatile solvents or inhalants, such as but not limited to glue and aerosol products. 
                                                                                43 
    7. Substances that when ingested cause a physiological effect that is similar to the effect of a controlled substance as 
    defined  by  state  or  federal  law,  such  as  but  not  limited  to  herbal  incense  or  other  products  containing  synthetic 
    cannabinoids. 
    8. Prescription or patent drugs, except those for which permission for use in school has been granted pursuant to Board 
    policy. 
     
    For purposes of this policy, under the influence shall include any consumption or ingestion of controlled substances by a 
    student. 
     
    Off-Campus Activities 
    This policy shall also apply to student conduct that occurs off school property and would violate the Code of Student 
    Conduct if: 
    1. There is a nexus between the proximity or timing of the conduct in relation to the student's attendance at school or 
    school-sponsored activities. 
    2. The student is a member of an extracurricular activity and has been notified that particular off-campus conduct could 
    result in exclusion from such activities. 
    3. Student expression or conduct materially and substantially disrupts the operations of the school, or the administration 
    reasonably anticipates that the expression or conduct is likely to materially and substantially disrupt the operations of the 
    school. 
    4. The conduct has a direct nexus to attendance at school or a school-sponsored activity, such as an agreement to complete 
    a transaction outside of school that would violate the Code of Student Conduct. 
    5. The conduct involves the theft or vandalism of school property. 
     
    The Superintendent or designee shall develop administrative regulations to identify and control substance abuse in the 
    schools which: 
    1. Establish procedures to deal with students suspected of using, possessing, being under the influence, or distributing 
    controlled substances in school, up to and including expulsion and referral for prosecution. 
    2. Disseminate to students, parents/guardians and staff the Board policy and administrative regulations governing student 
    abuse of controlled substances. 
    3. Provide education concerning the dangers of abusing controlled substances. 
    4. Establish procedures for education and readmission to school of students convicted of offenses involving controlled 
    substances.  Incidents of possession, use and sale of controlled substances by any person on school property shall be 
    reported to the Office of Safe Schools on the required form at least once each year. 
     
    In all cases involving students and controlled substances, the need to protect the school community from undue harm and 
    exposure to drugs shall be recognized. 
     
    No student may be admitted to a program that seeks to identify and rehabilitate the potential abuser without the 
    intelligent, voluntary and aware consent of the student and parent/guardian. 
     
    Anabolic Steroids 
    The Board prohibits the use of anabolic steroids by students involved in school related athletics, except for a valid medical 
    purpose. Body building and muscle enhancement of athletic ability are not valid medical purposes. Human Growth 
    Hormone (HGH) shall not be included as an anabolic steroid. 
    Students shall be made aware annually of the dangers of steroid use; that anabolic steroids are classified as controlled 
    substances; and that their use, unauthorized possession, purchase, or sale could subject students to suspension, expulsion 
    and/or criminal prosecution. 
    The following minimum penalties are prescribed for any student athlete found in violation of the prohibited use of anabolic 
    steroids: 
     
                               44 
      1.  For a first violation, suspension from school athletics for the remainder of the season. 
      2.  For a second violation, suspension from school athletics for the remainder of the season and for the following 
        season. 
      3.  For  a  third  violation,  permanent  suspension  from  school  athletics.    No  student  shall  be  eligible  to  resume 
        participation in school athletics unless a medical determination has been submitted, verifying that no residual 
        evidence of steroids exists. 
     
    Reasonable Suspicion/Testing 
    If based on the student's behavior, medical symptoms, vital signs or other observable factors, the building principal has 
    reasonable suspicion that the student is under the influence of a controlled substance, the student may be required to 
    submit to drug or alcohol testing. The testing may include but is not limited to the analysis of blood, urine, saliva, or the 
    administration of a Breathalyzer test. 
     
    Dress Code

    1.   For  all  informal  dances, students in grades nine through twelve are permitted to attend.  NO middle school or 
    elementary students will be allowed to attend high school dances under any circumstances.  Some formal/semi-formal 
    dances have specific age/grade requirements; for example, to attend the West Branch Jr./Sr. Prom, a student or guest 
    must be in Grade 9 through 20 years of age.  No attendee can be 21 years of age or older.  Only students who meet these 
    requirements are permitted to attend the dance.  This information will be given to the students at the time they sign up 
    for the dance.   No guests over the age of twenty will be permitted to any school dance.  
     
    2.  Some formal/semi-formal dances have specific dress code requirements.  This information will be given to the students 
    at the time they sign up for the dance.   Students who do not follow these requirements will not be permitted entrance to 
    the dance. 
     
    3.  A West Branch student may sign in ONE guest for a dance and meet all deadlines for registering.  The student will need 
    to fill out the Guest Permit Form.  Guests must be able to show proof of age upon request and follow our grade level 
    requirements.    Students are to show their ID cards to any chaperone(s) who request(s) to see them. 
     
    4.  Upon entering the dance, all students are to proceed immediately to the "money" table in order to enter the dance.  
    There is to be no loitering in the lobby.  Students are either attending the dance, or they are to leave school property. 
     
    5.  Students are to conduct themselves according to all school policies, rules, and guidelines.   
     
    6.  Students will be removed from the dance for any infraction for which the advisor(s) in charge deem(s) necessary.  
    Students removed from the dance will immediately call for transportation home, will sit on a bench in the front hall with 
    a chaperone or security guard, and will sign out when leaving.  Depending on the severity of the infraction, the student9s 
    parents/guardians will be contacted by the advisors. 
                               53 
           
          7.  A student in grade nine must stay at the dance until it is over, or until his/her parent/guardian notifies the head 
          chaperone(s) that the student is leaving. 
           
          8.  All students leaving before the dance is over will sign out, and must leave school property immediately. 
           
          9.  Drinking and eating are permitted in the cafeteria during a dance.  Students are expected to be responsible for any 
          garbage they generate.  Trash cans are always available. 
           
          10.  The advisor(s) will determine the appropriateness of dance styles and reserve(s) the right, at any time, to stop the 
          music and/or end the dance itself.  "Moshing," slamming into one another, will not be tolerated!  
           
          If students have any questions about rules/policies for dances, they should contact the advisor and/or the principal.   
           
          Disciplinary Levels 
          Level 1: Students who have been documented as displaying guidance and SAP concerns.  Level 1 behavior will not receive 
          consequences for these behaviors. The guidance concerns are logged so that students9 teachers and guidance counselors 
          may track changes in student behavior that could be related to mental health issues or significant changes in students9 
          environment that could have an effect on educational success. 
           
          Examples of Level 1 Behaviors: 
            •    Isolated from Peers                                        •    Sudden Change in Grades/Performance 
            •    Hygiene Concerns                                           •    Deteriorating Appearance 
            •    Emotional/Crying in Class                                  •    Not Dressing for PE Class 
           
          Level 2 (Minors): The student exhibits misbehavior that impedes orderly classroom procedures or interferes with the 
          orderly operation of the school.  Many of these acts of misbehavior will be handled by the faculty or staff member who 
          observes the infraction, while repeated offenses may require administrative or guidance office support.   
           
          Example of Level 2 Behaviors: 
            •    Cell Phone Violation                                                •    Tardy to Class (Office Handled 1-4 Warnings) 
            •    Inappropriate Language                                              •    Cafeteria Disturbance 
            •    Public Display of Affection                                         •    Academic Dishonesty 
            •    Dress Code Violation                                                •    Horseplay 
            •    Computer Misuse (minor)                                             •    Defiance 
            •    Inappropriate Language                                              •    Misuse of Pass 
            •    Disrespect to students/staff 
            •    Safety Violation (LABS) 
           
          Level 3 (Major/Office Level): The student exhibits misbehavior that is serious enough or frequent enough that it disrupts 
          the learning of others.  Many of these infractions will be the continuation of Level 2 misbehaviors because consequences 
          at that level have failed to correct the problem. 
           
                               Examples of Level 3 Behaviors: 
           •    Harassment – Verbal or Physical                                   •    Repeated Documented Minors

           •    Bullying                                                          •    Minor Altercation  
           
                                                                                   54 
          Level  4  (Major/Office  Level):    When  a  student  demonstrates  a  Level  4  behavioral  concern,  the  behavior  should 
          immediately be logged and the office administrator should immediately provide an office-based consequence.  Offenses 
          in this level could result in police action.

          NOTE: Level I, II, III and IV examples and disciplinary options are not limited to those provided.  The administration reserves 
          the right to assign a level offense to an unlisted infraction or reassign the level of offense dependent upon its severity and 
          frequency.  In addition, students will be referred to alternative education settings if behavior is consistently showing 
          disregard for policy and school rules.   
           
           
                                                                                   55

              Homeless Liaison Letter 
              Attention Parents and Guardians 
               
              Federal guidelines, as set forth in No Child Left Behind Act of 2001, require that local school identify name 
              children who are homeless. The federal mandate, and the intention of West Branch S/D is to ensure that 
              homeless children and youth have access to free appropriate public education on an equal basis with other 
              children.  Children who are homeless, including those living with others, may qualify for assistance with school 
              lunch, with school supplies/materials, with tutoring, and with transportation so that they can remain in their 
              school of origin.   
               
              If you believe your child(ren) may qualify for this service, please contact the principal of your child(ren)9s school.  
              You may also contact Dave Williamson at (814) 345-5615 extension 1006. 
               
              Homeless children may be identified as living in the following situations: 
                  •    Public or private shelters; 
                  •    Public or private places not designated for/or ordinarily used as regular sleeping accommodations 
                       such as vehicles, parks, motels, campgrounds, etc.; 
                  •    Living with a parent(s) in a domestic violence shelter; 
                  •    Individuals and/or families living with relatives or friends due to a lack of housing; 
                  •    Living in transitional housing programs; 
                  •    Runaway children (under age 18) and children who have been abandoned or forced out of the home 
                       by parents or other caretakers.  They may be in temporary shelters awaiting assistance from social 
                       service agencies, or may live alone on the street or move from place to place among family members, 
                       friends or acquaintances.  This also includes such youth from 18 to 21 of age who may still be eligible 
                       for educational services in regular or special education; 
                  •    Children of migrant families who lack adequate housing; 
                  •    Children abandoned in hospitals or awaiting foster care; or 
                  •    School-age, unwed mothers or expectant mothers living in houses for unwed mothers when they 
                       have no other available living accommodations. 
              If your living situation changes during the school year or over the summer, and you and your child(ren) become 
              homeless, please be sure to contact the schools.  We will work with you so that your child(ren)9s education is 
              disrupted as little as possible.

                                                    Mark Mitchell, Superintendent 
        
       Dear Parents / Guardians: 
        
       West Branch Area School District has an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Program for control of insects, rodents and 
       weeds.  Our IPM Program focuses on making the school building and grounds an unfavorable habitat for pests by removing 
       food and water sources and eliminating pests9 hiding and breeding places.  We accomplish this through routine cleaning 
       and maintenance.  We monitor the school buildings and grounds to detect any pests that are present.  The pest monitoring 
       team consists of our building maintenance, office, and teaching staff, as well as our students.  Pest sightings are reported 
       to our IPM Coordinator who evaluates the 8pest problem9 and determines the appropriate pest management techniques 
       to address the problem.  The techniques can include increased sanitation, modifying storage practices, sealing entry 
       points, physically removing the pest, etc. 
        
       From time to time, it may be necessary to use chemicals to control a pest problem.  Chemicals will only be used when 
       necessary and will not be routinely applied.  When chemicals are used, the school will try to use the least toxic products 
       possible.  Applications will be made only when teachers and students do not have access to the area(s) being treated.  
       Notices will be posted in these areas 72 hours prior to application and for two days following the application. 
        
       Parents or guardians of students enrolled in the school may request prior notification of specific pesticide applications 
       made at the school.  To receive notification, you must request to be placed on the school9s 8Notification Registry9.  If you 
       would like to be placed on this registry, please send a signed letter to your child9s principal requesting to be added to the 
       registry.  Each year the district will prepare a new Notification Registry. 
        
       If a chemical application must be made to control an emergency pest problem, notice will be provided by telephone to 
       any parent or guardian who has requested such notification.  Exemptions to this notification include disinfectants and 
       anti-microbial products; self-containerized baits placed in areas not accessible to students, and gel type baits placed in 
       cracks, crevices or voids. 
        
       This letter conforms to the requirements of the Integrated Pest Management Act 35 of 2002 and assures parents and 
       guardians of our commitment to continue providing the safest atmosphere possible for our students.  If you have any 
       questions, please contact Mr. David Catherman, IPM Coordinator at 345-5615. 
       Sincerely,

       Superintendent

      be confirmed verbally, in writing or by another manner by shelter providers, outreach workers, case managers, 
      juvenile probation officers and others.  
      Parents/Guardians and students have the authority to determine what information shall be shared with the 
      district.  
      Information related to the student's educational instability status shall be confidential and disclosed by the 
      point of contact or other administrators only to other school staff who have a legitimate need to know unless 
      authorized by the student or parent/guardian.[29][30]  
      Enrollment  
      Except when an unaccompanied youth or the parents/guardians of a homeless youth request otherwise, it shall 
      be presumed that a student experiencing educational instability shall continue to be enrolled in their school of 
      origin unless it is determined that it is not in the student's best interest to remain in the school of origin.[5][27]  
      In accordance with the homeless child's or youth's best interest, the district shall continue to enroll a homeless 
      student in the student's school of origin within the district while the student remains homeless and through 
      the end of the academic year in which the student obtains permanent housing.[27]  
      An unaccompanied youth or the parents/guardians of a homeless student may request enrollment in any 
      grade-appropriate school within the district regardless of the district attendance area where the student is 
      actually living or a school of origin in another district.[27]  
      The district's point of contact shall assist an unaccompanied youth in placement or enrollment decisions, giving 
      priority to the views of the student in determining where the student will be enrolled.[27]  
      Best Interest Determination -  
      The best interest determination shall be made in accordance with federal and state laws and regulations, court 
      orders and established local procedures.  
      In making a best interest determination, the district shall:[5][27]  
          1.  In  the  case  of  a  homeless  child  or  unaccompanied  youth,  give  priority  to  the  request  of  the 
          parent/guardian or unaccompanied youth.  
          2.  Consider  student-centered  factors  related  to  impact  of  mobility  on  achievement,  education, 
          appropriateness  of  the  current  educational  setting,  health  and  safety,  and  proximity  to  living 
          arrangements including foster care placement.  
      The cost of transportation shall not be used as a factor in the best interest determination.  
      Documentation related to the best interest determination shall be maintained in the student's education 
      record.[29][30]  
      Timeliness of Enrollment -  
      When a school receives a student experiencing educational instability, the school shall immediately enroll the 
      student and begin instruction, even if:[4][5][Z][29][30][31][32][33][34] [35]  
          1. The student is unable to produce records normally required for enrollment. [27][31]  
          2. The application or enrollment deadline has passed.[27][31][32]  
                              72 
      The district's point of contact shall immediately contact the school last attended by the student to obtain 
      relevant academic or other records.[27]  
      The district may require a parent/guardian to submit contact information.  
      Grade Level Assignment -  
      If the district is unable to determine the student's grade level due to missing or incomplete records, the district 
      may administer tests or utilize appropriate means to determine the student's assignment within the school. 
      [36]  
      Dispute Resolution  
      If a dispute involving a student experiencing educational instability arises, the concern shall be addressed 
      and/or resolved at the lowest appropriate level in accordance with Board policy, unless otherwise stated 
      below.[37]  
      Dispute Resolution for Homeless Students -  
      If the district determines that it is not in the student's best interest to attend the school of origin or the school 
      requested by the unaccompanied youth or parent/guardian, the district shall provide the unaccompanied 
      youth or parent/guardian with a written explanation of the reasons for its determination. The explanation shall 
      be in a manner and form understandable to the unaccompanied youth or parent/guardian and shall include 
      information regarding the right to appeal. [27]  
      If a dispute arises over eligibility, enrollment or school selection:[27]  
          1. The parent/guardian or unaccompanied youth shall be referred to the district's point of contact, who 
          shall assist in the dispute resolution process.  
          2. The student shall be immediately enrolled in the school in which enrollment is sought, pending final 
          resolution of the dispute, including all available appeals.  
          3. The district's point of contact shall issue a written decision of the dispute within twenty (20) business 
          days of being notified of the dispute.  
      A parent/guardian or unaccompanied youth may file a complaint with the Coordinator of Pennsylvania's 
      Education for Children and Youth Experiencing Homelessness Program.  
      Dispute Resolution for Students in Foster Care -  
      If a dispute arises over the appropriate school placement for a child in foster care, to the extent feasible and 
      appropriate, the child shall remain in their school of origin, pending resolution of the dispute. [2] [38]  
      Education Records 
      Information about a student's educational instability shall be treated as a student education record subject to 
      the protections of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA), and shall not be deemed to be 
      directory information.[29] [30][39]  
      The district may disclose personally identifiable information from the education records of a student without 
      written consent of the parent/guardian or the eligible student if the disclosure is: [29][30][39]  
          1. To comply with a court order authorizing the disclosure of education records in a case where a parent 
          is a party to a proceeding involving child abuse or neglect or a dependency matter.  
          2. To an agency caseworker or other representative of a state or local child welfare agency, or tribal 
          organization, who has the right to access a student's case plan, as defined and determined by the state 
          or tribal organization, when such agency or organization is legally responsible, in accordance with state 
          or tribal law, for the care and protection of the student, provided that the education records, or the 
                              73 
          personally identifiable information contained in such records, of the student will not be disclosed by 
          such agency or organization, except to an individual or entity engaged in addressing the student's 
          education needs and authorized by such agency or organization to receive such disclosure and such 
          disclosure is consistent with the state or tribal laws applicable to protecting the confidentiality of a 
          student's education records.  
      Comparable Services  
      Students experiencing educational instability shall be provided services comparable to those offered to other

      Transportation for Homeless Students -  
      The district shall provide transportation for homeless students to their school of origin or the school they 
      choose to attend within the district.[3][10][27]  
      If the school of origin is outside district boundaries or homeless students live in another district but will attend 
      their  school  of  origin  in  this  district,  the  school  districts  shall  agree  upon  a  method  to  apportion  the 
      responsibility and costs of the transportation.[27]  
      Transportation for Students in Foster Care -  
      The district shall ensure that children in foster care needing transportation to their school of origin promptly 
      receive transportation in a cost-effective manner.[6][10]  
      To ensure that transportation for children in foster care to their school of origin is provided, arranged, and 
      funded, the district shall collaborate with the local children and youth agency to develop a local transportation 
      plan.[6]  
      The transportation plan shall address the following: [6]  
          1. The procedure the district and local children and youth agency will follow to provide transportation 
          for children in foster care in a cost-effective manner and in accordance with applicable law. [8]

        1.  3. Dispute resolution procedures to ensure that any disagreements regarding the cost of 
          transportation are resolved promptly and fairly, and do not impact a student's ability to remain in the 
          school of origin during the dispute resolution process.  
      The district shall submit the local transportation plan, including any updates or revisions, to the Pennsylvania 
      Department of Education.  
      Transportation shall be provided to children in foster care in accordance with the local transportation plan 
      regardless of whether transportation is provided to district students.  
      Course Credit and Graduation  
      The district shall ensure that each student experiencing educational instability in grades nine (9) through twelve 
      (12) is provided with a graduation plan to facilitate the student's timely graduation. The graduation plan shall 
      specify the courses and other requirements necessary for the student to graduate. The district's efforts to 
      ensure that the student experiencing educational instability graduates in a timely manner may include: [4][5][6]  
          1.  Waiving a specific course required for graduation if similar coursework has been satisfactorily 
          completed in another school entity or the student has demonstrated competency in that content area. 
          Evidence as to whether coursework has been satisfactorily completed and the amount of full or partial 
          credit assigned, may be determined through any of the following: [4][19]  
             a. Competency demonstration, which could include, but is not limited to:  
                 i. Submission of an essay, presentation or project.

                 course,  an  experiential  learning  opportunity  or  internship  that  demonstrates 
                 competence in the content area.  
             b. Performance on an examination.  
             c. Successful completion of a career and technical education course.  
             d. Other evidence or method determined appropriate by the district.  
          2.  If  a  specific  course  requirement  cannot  be waived, the district shall provide an alternative or 
          modified course of study that is currently offered to students and that will assist the student with 
          acquiring the required work or competency requirements by the anticipated graduation date.  
          3. If, after considering full and partial course credits, waiving courses or providing alternative courses 
          of study, the district determines that the student meets the established graduation requirements, the 
          student shall be allowed to participate in the graduation ceremony and graduate with their peers.  
          If the student is determined not eligible for graduation, the district may request a high school diploma 
          from the prior school entity. The prior school entity may issue a diploma if the student meets the prior 
          school entity's graduation requirements.  
      Keystone Diploma  
      In any school year for which demonstration of proficiency on a Keystone exam is required for graduation, a 
      student who has successfully satisfied the graduation requirements may obtain a secondary school diploma 
      known as the Keystone Diploma from the PA Department of Education, if both of the following provisions 
      apply:[4][43]  
          1. All other graduation options have been exhausted.  
          2. The student is unable to obtain a diploma from the student's prior or receiving school entity.  
                              75 
      The district's point of contact shall assist the student in determining the student's eligibility for a Keystone 
      Diploma and, if eligible, obtaining the Keystone Diploma from the PA Department of Education.[4][43]  
      Students with Disabilities -  
      Students experiencing educational instability who have an IEP shall maintain the right to special education and 
      the right to graduate either through attainment of credits or through the completion of the goals established 
      in their IEP.[11][19]  
      Students with an IEP may elect to remain in school until age twenty-one (21) even if the district determines 
      there is an earlier pathway to graduation. Such students may participate in the graduation ceremony with their 
      current graduating class, even if the student elected to remain in school.[19]
