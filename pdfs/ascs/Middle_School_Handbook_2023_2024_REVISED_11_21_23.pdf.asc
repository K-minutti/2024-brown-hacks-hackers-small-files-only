       WELCOME! 
        
        
        
       Welcome to West Branch Area Middle School! 
         
       Great things are happening here at West Branch Area Middle School!  We are committed to providing the 
       best middle school education possible in a safe learning environment.  Once again, we will be utilizing 
       block scheduling and advisory between students and staff.  Our plan is to develop a community of 
       learners.  In addition, we strive to continue to increase academic performance and success for all 
       students through the implementation of PA Core Curriculum Standards.  We believe that success is best 
       attained through the cooperation of students, parents, and school staff.  
        
       Another research-based program West Branch Area Middle will continue to implement is Positive School 
       Behavior supports.  The middle school staff will be setting clear and high expectations for student 
       behavior.  Students will be given positive supports for making good decisions.   
        
       Should you wish to become involved or if you would like to contact us for any reason, please call our main 
       office at (814) 345-5627.  It would be our pleasure to speak with you! 
        
       We are looking forward to an exciting and rewarding school year!

    The West Branch Area School District is moving to a paperless student registration/form system.  As a result, the district 
    will be utilizing the InfoSnap management system.  Therefore, district forms will be accessible online for parent/guardian 
    signatures.  Please locate the InfoSnap link on the district website at http://www.westbranch.org to locate the necessary 
    documents for signature.  Some of the documents included but not limited to will be: the student and parent handbook 
    signature page, the emergency contact form from the nurse, the internet acceptable use policy, the educational trip 
    form, and the field trip permission form.  Failure to complete the forms may result in the denial of student privileges – 
    i.e. field trips, monthly rewards, etc. 
     
                        STUDENT DROP-OFF/PICK-UP 
      ●  STUDENT DROP-OFF 
        If you will be dropping your child off for school in the morning (instead of having your child ride the bus to 
        school) you must do the following: 
         
          o  DROPPING OFF BEFORE 7:45 a.m. 
           You must drop your child off at the side of the building nearest the football field.  You cannot drive 
           through the playground to access the back of the school – you must enter through the far end of the 
           school. If you drop off your child before the buses unload, your child must go to the library until 
           students are released to the cafeteria or their classroom. Please contact the middle school office if you 
           plan to drop your child off at the school before 7:45 a.m.  
     
          o  DROPPING OFF AFTER 7:45 a.m. 
           Students dropped off after 7:45 a.m. must enter through the office. 
     
           NOTE:  If you drop your child off after 8:00 a.m. your child will be considered late, and MUST have an 
                        excuse.  If your child does not have an excuse, your child will be considered Tardy (Late) 
                        Unexcused.  If your child does have an excuse, your child will be considered Tardy Excused. 
                        (See Late/Tardy Policy under Attendance) 
            
      ●  STUDENT PICK-UP 
        Middle school students will be picked up at the corner of the administration wing at dismissal.  Parents 
        should park in an available space and wait for their child to exit the building. 
      
     
                  PARENT LETTERS FROM TEACHERS/ADMINISTRATION 
    Many times throughout the school year memos and letters are sent home to parents to keep you informed of events 
    and schedules with dates and times.  Please communicate with teachers via Parent Square.  This will ensure your 
    awareness of any and all events that take place throughout the year. 
     
     
     
     
                                 
                                 
                                 
                                                          5 
                                 
                             VISITORS 
                                 
    Parents are cordially invited to visit the school at any time. Upon arriving at school please ring the buzzer and state your 
    name and reason for admittance to the building.  Upon entering the school, please report directly to the HS office lobby  
    to scan in. You will need your driver9s license upon entering for scanning purposes. Students are only released from the 
    building through the office. Anyone having business in the building will be given a visitor9s pass that must be visible at all 
    times.  Upon leaving the building, the visitor must scan out in the office and return the pass before leaving the building.  
    Appointments to see specific teachers must be made in advance and scheduled during non-instructional times.  If you 
    would like to volunteer and/or visit your student during lunch, you must have current clearances on file in the district 
    office.  Forms for filing for the necessary clearances are available in the Superintendent9s office.  Failure to complete 
    InfoSnap forms may result in being unable to volunteer within the school, eat lunch with your child, or attend field trips.  
                                 
                Student/Item Pick-up & Drop-off During School Hours 
                                 
    As part of increased school safety efforts, new student pick-up and drop-off procedures will be implemented this year.  
    Before entering the office waiting area, you will be asked to state the nature of your visit (student pick-up, drop-off, item 
    drop-off, etc.).  Upon being granted entry into the waiting area, you will scan your license and sign the appropriate form 
    (time in/out, reason, etc.). For student pick-up, we will bring the student to meet you in the waiting area. If you are 
    dropping off an item (backpack, lunch items, instrument, etc.), you will fill out the appropriate form, and we will be sure 
    to get the item to the appropriate person.  
                            TEXTBOOKS 
    All basic textbooks are loaned to the students for their use during the school year and are to be kept clean and handled 
    carefully.  Textbooks must be covered if required by the classroom teacher.   Any student losing or damaging a textbook 
    will be required to reimburse the school district the amount of the replacement cost.   
     
                             LOCKERS 
    Homeroom teachers will assign each student a hall locker.  All students must keep their books, coats, backpacks, and 
    other belongings in their own locker.  Sharing lockers with other students is not permitted.  Athletes, musicians, etc. 
    with bags or cases too large for the locker or to be carried class to class must be stored in a designated area.  For 
    example, many athletes will take a larger bag to a coach9s room to store for the day.  Band students take their 
    instruments to the band room.   
     
    The school provides students with hall lockers and locks but assumes no responsibility for the safe-keeping of the 
    contents of the lockers.  Lockers must be kept locked at all times.  Valuables should not be left in lockers.  If necessary, 
    students may store valuables in the middle school office during the day and pick them up after school. 
     
    Students and parents are reminded that lockers remain the property of the West Branch Area School District. There is no 
    right to privacy extended to any student concerning their locker. The school district and its officials reserve the right to 
    inspect and search a student9s locker at any time and remove any object or material which is illegal, contrary to school 
    rules, or which may be detrimental to the school or student.  Such materials may be used as evidence against the 
    student in disciplinary, juvenile, or criminal proceedings.  Prior to a locker search, the student may be notified and given 
    the opportunity to be present.  However, when such authorities have a reasonable suspicion that the locker contains 
    materials which pose a threat to the health, welfare, and safety of students/staff/visitors in the school, the locker may 
    be searched without the student9s presence.  The school assumes no responsibility for student9s belongings stored in 
    hall locker. 
     
    Each student must lock his/her locker. If a key lock is being used, an extra key must be given to the office in case his/her 
    key is lost.  Students not locking lockers will be subject to the school discipline code for violation of school rules.  
    Students are responsible for not sharing their combination or key with others and ensuring the lock is kept locked.  
    Students who are unable to purchase a lock will be given one by the office.  A $5.00 fee will be charged to any student 
                                                          6 
    not turning in the school provided lock at the end of the school year.  In addition, if a student loses a school provided 
    lock during the school year, they can purchase an additional lock from the office for $5.00.  
     
                           STUDENT DEVICES 
    Students are responsible to transport, store, and carry their school issued devices safely. When students are 
    transporting their devices room-to-room, to the cafeteria, or to other parts of the building, etc. they must place their 
    device in it9s proper carrying case.  Students will need reminders initially and periodically to remember to always use 
    their case.  If students fail to follow this policy, there may be disciplinary action taken and/or they may lose their device 
    privileges.   
     
                             eHallpass 
    Students and staff utilize an electronic hall pass system during the school day. 
     
                           LIBRARY BOOKS 
    In order for all students to have access to library books, it is important that students return library books on their due 
    dates.  Students have ample access to the Library throughout the day to check out and return books.   
                                 
                           SCHOOL CLOSINGS 
    Should it become necessary to close school (due to weather, power outage, etc.), an announcement will be made on the 
    local radio and television stations and via Alert Solutions.  The Alert Solutions phone system will also be used to contact 
    parents for two (2) hour delays and early dismissal announcements.  Please do not call the school or the radio/TV 
    stations.  The following stations should be broadcasting any delay or cancellation information:  WPSU, Fox 8 WWCP, ABC 
    23 WATM, WTAJ, WJAC, and WOKW 102.9 FM.  Please also refer to the school website and district Facebook page.  
     
    West Branch parents are encouraged to provide cell phone information as texts have the quickest delivery time when 
    messages are sent.  Currently, if you are able to login to the PowerSchool website, you have the ability to change your 
    contact information.  This will allow you to select your preferred method of contact.     
                      Flexible Instructional Days (FID) 
    During the 2021-2022 School Year, West Branch Area School District will be utilizing Flexible Instruction Days (FIDs), 
    which may be used in place of a school day that would be canceled because of inclement weather or another emergency 
    situation. On a FID, students will complete learning activities and assignments provided by their teachers. Implementing 
    a FID will not require additional make-up days when school is canceled. The District can use up to five (5) FIDs per school 
    year. Students and parents/guardians will be informed of a FID through the District's notification systems in the same 
    way that school closings and delays are currently announced.  
     
    What will be expected of my child during a FID (grades 3-12)? 
    Students in grades 3 through 12 will download offline FID lessons to their device prior to the FID day.  Students with the 
    internet may log on to Google Classroom to access assignment information.  Students are expected to complete all 
    lessons during the FID day. Students will submit/return their assignments upon their return to school the next day.  Any 
    student who fails to complete their FID assignments on their FID day, will be marked as absent unexcused from school 
    and will receive a zero on any graded assignment that was not submitted. 
     
    What will be expected of my child during a FID (grades PreK-2)? 
    Elementary students will work on FID lessons unique to their grade level. Students will receive a FID folder with 5 
    lessons. Students are expected to complete all lessons during the FID day. Students will submit/return their assignments 
    upon their return to school the next day. Any student who fails to complete their FID assignments on their FID day, will 
    be marked as absent unexcused from school and will receive a zero on any graded assignment that was not submitted. 
     
    How does student attendance work? 
    Student attendance will be determined by verification and completion of the FID lesson and/or assignment. Students 
    should not report to school on a FID. 
                                                          7 
          
          
         How can I contact a teacher or staff member during a FID? 
         All teachers and professional staff members will be available via email during a FID. This includes special area teachers 
         such as music, art, library, physical education, learning support, teachers in specialized programs, reading specialists, 
         and school counselors, nurses, social workers, speech therapists, interventionists, and principals, unless the individual is 
         ill that day. 
          
         What if my child needs help with a lesson/assignment on a FID, will teachers be available to answer questions? 
         Yes, all school-based staff members will be available to answer questions on a FID via email during the hours below. The 
         student technology help desk will also be available.

                     o   Elementary School-9:00 a.m. to 3:45 p.m. 
                          
         My child has an IEP, will his/her lesson be modified appropriately? 
         The FID lesson will be designed for students with special needs utilizing their program modifications, specially designed 
         instruction and supplementary aids and services identified in their individualized education plans. Upon return from a 
         FID, teachers of students with special needs will meet with their students to review work submitted, checking for 
         completion and understanding. Any related services (Physical Therapy, Occupational Therapy, Speech, etc.) scheduled 
         during the FID will be rescheduled according to the frequency requirements of the students9 individualized education 
         plan. 
          
         Will after school activities be canceled on a FID? 
         After school activities may be canceled based on the nature of the event that led to the FID day.

             All students in grades 5 , 6 , 7 , and 8  take the Pennsylvania Assessment English Language Arts and Math tests.  In 
             addition to an English Language Arts, and Math test, 8th grade students will also be assessed in the area of Science.  
             Individual student scores will be sent to parents.  The scores help to determine individual needs, scope and sequence, 
             and opportunities for tutoring.   
             Results from these tests are kept in each student9s cumulative file and are strictly confidential.  Available copies are sent 
             to parents.  All test data concerning each student is used as reference materials for parents, teachers, administrators, 
             and the students themselves to assist in making more informed decisions regarding student progress within the 
             educational program.

             The guidance counselor will assist you throughout your years at West Branch Middle School.  The counselor is available 
             to discuss a variety of issues, including student issues, academics, school, and family.  Other guidance programs focus 
             around the areas of: academics, social emotional, and career exploration and readiness. 
              
                                                                                          Advisory Program 
             Program Rationale:  The period of adolescence is a time of rapid change and growth for students as they approach 
             physical, mental, and emotional maturity.  During this stage they desire more independence, experience new 
             responsibilities, and search for social identity.  With these new discoveries, they alter their role in their family, in their 
             class, and in the world around them.   
              
             The mission of the West Branch Middle School Advisory Program is to assist students with understanding their own 
             developmental needs so they can better make sense of themselves and the world around them, and become caring, 
             responsible, ethical citizens.  This is accomplished by each faculty member serving as an advisor to a small group of 
             students with whom they will foster a close relationship throughout the school year.  The faculty advisors work together 
             in grade level teams to plan a program to help students learn more effectively and efficiently in their academic work, 
             including helping them to grow socially and personally as they journey through the middle school years.  All students will 
             meet with their advisor daily.   
              
             The Advisory Program fosters a positive school climate where our students see their teachers as caring advocates who 
             are interested in their lives and development as well as their academic growth.   
              
                                                                                                                                                                                                    9 
                                                        REFERRAL SERVICES 
        There are times in some people9s lives when social and emotional problems come to the point where outside help may 
        be needed. The guidance department of West Branch Middle School has knowledge of agencies that may be of 
        assistance during these times. 
         
        If a student or parent would need any information or direction to a needed service, please contact the guidance 
        counselor. 
         
         Student Assistance Program (SAP) 
        The Student Assistance Program is a team of professionals working together to provide help for students who are 
        experiencing problems.  Alcohol and other drug abuse, disruptions at home, depression, pressure from peers, trouble at 
        work, loss of a loved one, or many other factors can lead a student to feel alone and hopeless.  The cause may differ, but 
        the result is usually the same - the student9s problems interfere with the educational process - a student who is troubled 
        struggles to learn. 
         
                SAP Team Members:  
                Mr. Hubler             Mr. McCamley            Mr. Matson             Mr. Caldwell                            
                Mrs. McGonigal         Mrs. Trude              Mrs. Rockey            Mrs. Dixon 
         
        It is the parent's right to be involved in the SAP process and to have full access to all school records under the applicable 
        state  and  federal  laws  and  regulations.   Involvement  of  parents  in  all  phases  of  the  Student  Assistance  Program 
        underscores the parent's role and responsibility in the decision-making process affecting their child's education and is key 
        to the successful resolution of problems. 
        A student can be referred to the program by parents, teachers, and/or friends.  This can be accomplished by contacting 
        any SAP team member.  From there, the referral is considered by the team and recommendations are made for support 
        such as: Tier 2, homework club, school based, etc. The information gathered is confidential.  The evaluation service is at 
        no cost to the family or student.  We are here to help! 
         
        West Branch Threat Assessment Team 
        The West Branch Area School District has a Threat Assessment Team. The team includes the Safe School Safety Security 
        Coordinator, Building Principals, Building Counselors, School Police, and Special Education Supervisor.  
        A Threat Assessment Team is <a multidisciplinary group of individuals identified by a chief school administrator responsible 
        for the assessment of and intervention with students whose behavior may indicate a threat to the safety of the student, 
        other students, school employees, school facilities, the community, or others.=  
         
                                                                    
                                            BULLYING/CYBERBULLYING/HARASSMENT 
         The West Branch Area School District Board of School Directors is committed to providing all students with a safe, 
         healthy, and civil school environment in which all members of the school community are treated with mutual respect, 
         tolerance, and dignity. To that end, the school district has in place policies, and practices that are designed to reduce 
         and eliminate bullying and harassment when they occur. 
          
         This policy is in effect while students are on property within jurisdiction of the school district; while on school-
         contracted or school-operated vehicles; and while attending or engaged in school-sponsored activities. Students who 
         file a bullying complaint or who have assisted or participated in any manner in a bullying investigation may not be 
         retaliated against.  
          
         Any violation of this policy shall be considered an infraction of the Code of Conduct, with discipline implemented 
         accordingly. All bullying behavior that is a violation of the PA Crimes Code will be reported to the appropriate legal 
         authorities. 
                                                                                                                           10 
      
     The Board encourages students who have been bullied to promptly report such incidents to the building principal or 
     designee. 
      
     Bullying shall be defined as an intentional electronic, written, verbal or physical act, or series of acts: 
      
     1.  Directed at another student or students. 
     2.  Which occurs in a school setting. 
     3.  That is severe, persistent, or pervasive. 
     4.  That has the effect of doing any of the following: 
      a.  Substantially interfering with a student9s education. 
      b.  Creating a threatening environment. 
      c.  Substantially disrupting the orderly operation of the school. 
           
     School setting shall mean in the school, on school grounds, in school vehicles, at a designated bus stop, or at any 
     activity sponsored, supervised, or sanctioned by the school.  
      
     Bullying, as defined in this policy, includes cyberbullying. 
      
     The Superintendent or designee shall develop administrative regulations to implement this policy. 
     This policy shall be implemented through the cooperative efforts of the Superintendent, building administrators, 
     school staff members, parents/guardians, regional police and state police, and the school district9s community.  
      
     Each staff member shall be responsible for maintaining an educational environment free from bullying. Staff members 
     who observe or become aware of an act of bullying shall take immediate, appropriate steps to intervene unless the 
     intervention would be a threat to staff members9 safety. In that case, or if the bullying persists, s/he shall report the 
     bullying to the school principal for further investigation. This investigation may include interviews with students, 
     parents/guardians, and school staff; review of school records; and any other appropriate means of investigation. 
      
     The Board expects that students and parents/guardians who become aware of an act of bullying shall report it to a 
     school official (usually the building principal) for further investigation. Any student who retaliates against another 
     person for reporting bullying, intimidation and/or physical assault shall be subject to further disciplinary action.  
      
     Students shall be informed about the policy on the district9s publicly accessible Internet web site, and in every 
     classroom. The policy shall be posted at a prominent location within each school building where such notices are 
     usually posted. Each school building principal shall ensure that the policy and procedures for reporting bullying 
     incidents are reviewed with students at least once each school year. 
      
     The Superintendent or designee, in cooperation with other appropriate administrators, shall review this policy every 
     three (3) years and recommend necessary revisions to the Board. 
      
     District administration shall annually provide the following information with the Safe School Report: 
     1. Board9s Bullying Policy. 
     2. Report of bullying incidents. 
     3. Information on the development and implementation of any bullying prevention, intervention, or education 
      programs. 
      
     The Code of Student Conduct, which shall contain this policy, shall be disseminated annually to students. 
     This policy shall be accessible in every classroom. The policy shall be posted in a prominent location within each school 
     building and on the district website, if available. 
      
     Preventive Measures Against Bullying  
                                                          11 
      
     A copy of this policy will be included in the student handbooks annually. Teachers, counselors, specialists, and school 
     administrators will routinely discuss bullying with students and will provide appropriate examples to assist students 
     with recognizing, identifying, and reporting bullying incidents. All students shall be informed that bullying will not be 
     tolerated in any form. All students shall be encouraged to report any bullying regardless of whether they are the victim 
     or an observer. 
      
     When an investigation substantiates that bullying has occurred, the building principal or assistant principal shall inform 
     staff who work with the offending student and the victim about the bullying so that those staff can more closely 
     monitor for future incidents of bullying. The primary purpose of such action is to protect the victim and deter such 
     behavior in the future. The disciplinary action imposed on the offender will match the severity of the offense. 
      
     Reporting Procedures Regarding Bullying 
      
     All students who believe they have been the victim of bullying shall promptly report the bullying incident to a teacher, 
     counselor, or building administrator. 
      
     All parents/guardians are encouraged to report the bullying incident(s) to a building administrator. 
      
     Any teacher/counselor who witnesses bullying or receives a report of bullying shall document such incident and 
     promptly investigate the matter. After the investigation has been completed, the building principal shall take 
     appropriate actions consistent with this policy. 
      
     Disciplinary And Other Actions Related to Bullying 
      
     A student who violates this policy shall be subject to appropriate disciplinary action consistent with the Code of 
     Student Conduct, which may include: 
      
     1.  Counseling within the school. 
     2.  Parental conference. 
     3.  Loss of school privileges. 
     4.  Exclusion from school-sponsored activities. 
     5.  Detention. 
     6.  Suspension. 
     7.  Expulsion. 
     8.  Board Hearing 
     9.  Referral to law enforcement officials. 
      
     If an investigation substantiates that bullying has occurred, a written record of the incident shall be placed in the file of 
     the offending students(s). Parents/Guardians of the offending students will be encouraged to attend one (1) or more 
     conferences with an administrator to review the bullying behavior and cooperative strategies for correcting it. The 
     building principal or designee shall also inform the victim9s parents/guardians of any and all bullying incidents involving 
     their child. 
      
     Disciplinary action shall be in accordance with the Board approved Code of Student Conduct depending on the severity 
     of the offense. If the investigation has determined that the conduct rises to the level of a crime, disciplinary action may 
     also include referral to law enforcement officials.  
      
                                                          12 
     All incidents of confirmed bullying shall be recorded in writing and placed in the offending student9s discipline file. The 
     penalties and prohibitions in this policy are in addition to, and do not replace or supersede, any related provisions in 
     district policy prohibiting conduct such as harassment, violence, assault, and hazing. 
      
     Discriminatory Harassment 
       
     Harassment by students, employees or third parties on the basis of race, color, age, creed, religion, sex, sexual 
     orientation, ancestry, national origin, marital status, pregnancy, handicap/disability or for participation in reports or 
     investigations of alleged discrimination is a form of discrimination and is subject to this policy. A person who is not 
     necessarily an intended victim or target of such harassment but is adversely affected by the offensive conduct may file 
     a report of discrimination on his/her own behalf.  
       
     For purposes of this policy, harassment shall consist of unwelcome conduct such as graphic, written, electronic, verbal 
     or nonverbal acts including offensive jokes, slurs, epithets and name-calling, ridicule or mockery, insults or put-downs, 
     offensive objects or pictures, physical assaults or threats, intimidation, or other conduct that may be harmful or 
     humiliating or interfere with a person9s school or school-related performance and which relates to an individual9s or 
     group9s race, color, age, creed, religion, sex, sexual orientation, ancestry, national origin, marital status, pregnancy or 
     handicap/disability when such conduct is: 
      
       1.  Sufficiently severe, persistent or pervasive; and 
          
       2.  A reasonable person in the complainant9s position would find that it creates an intimidating, threatening or 
        abusive educational environment such that it deprives or adversely interferes with or limits an individual or 
        group of the ability to participate in or benefit from the services, activities or opportunities offered by a 
        school.

                            Safe2Say 
    Safe2Say Something is a youth violence prevention program coordinated by the PA Office of the Attorney General.  The 
    program teaches youth and adults how to recognize warning signs and signals, especially within social media, from 
    individuals who may be a threat to themselves or others and to say something before it is too late.  With Safe2Say 
    Something, it is easy and confidential to report safety concerns to help prevent violence and tragedies.  Submit an 
    anonymous tip report through the Safe2Something system via the phone application (Safe2Say Something PA) or at the 
    tip line number: 1-844-SAF2SAY.

    PUPIL PROGRESS REPORTS 
    In order to inform parents of the progress their child is making, report cards are sent home four times during the school 
    year on a nine-week basis. Progress reports are sent home between report cards if a child is experiencing problems. 
     
    In addition to the written reports, every parent is given the opportunity to meet with their child9s teachers in a 
    scheduled conference after school.  Parent conferences take place in November. Information will be sent home and/or 
    posted online in order to make arrangements for a conference.  Parents may also schedule individual conferences, as 
    needed, by contacting their child9s teacher.  We always encourage parents to come in for conferences, and will make all 
    attempts to work around your schedule (within reason).  
     
    ACADEMIC HONOR ROLL 
    Middle school students will be selected for academic Honor Roll on a quarterly basis. The criteria for Honor Roll

      ●  A quarterly grade point average (GPA) of 93% or higher. Please note that GPA9s are not rounded up for the 
        purpose of Honor Roll selection.  
      ●  A minimum grade of 90% in all subjects, including core subjects, special subjects, phys. ed., etc.  
         
    POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR CLASSROOM ASSIGNMENT IN WEST BRANCH AREA MIDDLE SCHOOL 
        To maintain an equitable balance of students in each room, the following procedures are followed: 
         
        1.  A team consisting of the principal, classroom teachers, and school counselor will review the following           
             information prior to grouping students: 
         
           A.  A grade level list of students identified as high, medium or low ability students as prepared by the     
                current teacher. 
           B.  Advice from the learning support teacher in regard to any special needs their student9s may have. 
           C.  Recommendations from current homeroom teachers as to who should or should not be placed in the  
                 same room based on current peer interaction. 
           D.  Input from the school nurse based on her confidential health list. 
     
        2.  Classroom assignments will be made as equitable as possible with regard to gender, total number of  
              students, student abilities, student disabilities, or any other special needs a student may have. 
     
        3.  Parent Requests: 
         
           Requests made for a child to have a particular classroom teacher will not be accepted. This includes 
           asking for a male/female teacher, younger/veteran teacher, etc. as this may identify a particular staff 
           member without specifying that teacher by name. 
            
        NOTE:  There are a variety of reasons why specific teacher requests will not be granted (i.e. last minute staffing 
           changes due to retirements, leave of absences, transfers, classes being added or reduced, etc. which may 
           create openings within our building, and that may impact our staffing). This policy is made in order to be 
           fair to all families and will allow us, as a team, to make the decisions which are in the best interest of 
           every student. 
     
        4.  Classroom lists will be reviewed by a grade level team of the current grade level and specials teachers for 
         any possible changes (i.e. behavior issues, student compatibility, academic issues, etc.). 
     
        5.  Classroom assignments will be provided prior to the start of the next academic year. 
      
        NOTE:  This assignment may change over the summer due to enrollment issues (i.e. student withdrawals causing 
                     an uneven number of students in a classroom) and/or staff issues (see NOTE above under Part A). 
     
                                                          14 
        6.  New students enrolling in the middle school over the summer will be assigned to the grade level classroom 
         with the lowest number of students. 
         
        7.  If issues arise during the school year, they will be dealt with by the administration (including meeting with 
         parents). 
     
                         PROMOTION/RETENTION 
    The promotion of the pupils from grade to grade is dependent upon: 
           a.  Academic Achievement 
           b.  Attendance 
     
    PROMOTION BASED ON ACADEMIC ACHIEVEMENT 
    The grading of the teacher and their evaluation of the students9 progress and achievement is a large determining factor 
    in a student9s promotion/retention.  In the middle school, progress is from grade to grade. 
     
    In determining the promotion or retention of a student the guiding rule used by the teacher is, <What is best for the 
    student?= This, however, does not imply automatic promotion.  Promotion may not be the optimal solution for all 
    students. The teacher is obligated not to send a student into a classroom situation or environment in which that student 
    does not have a chance to experience success. <Success breeds success and failure breeds failure.= The student must be 
    placed in the grade level that best affords them the opportunity to experience success. 
     
    Retention is based on a thorough analysis of the child9s ability to master skills and profit from retention, as compared to 
    automatic promotion into an academically frustrating environment that can only foster negative self-concept and self-
    esteem. Retention, therefore, requires an individual analysis of the effects that it may have on the total child 
    (academically, intellectually, psychologically, emotionally, physically, and socially). 
     
    The key person in determining a child9s readiness for the requirements associated with promotion into the next grade is 
    the teacher.  The teacher, better than anyone inside the school system, knows the academic problems and strengths 
    associated with the children under their tutelage.  Teachers are instructed to inform parents as soon as difficulties 
    affecting possible promotion arise.  This is accomplished through written reports, report cards, notes, and 
    parent/teacher conferences.  The middle school principal will be informed of and be in agreement with all retentions. 
     
    PROMOTION BASED ON ATTENDANCE 
    If a student is absent 24 total days or more the student will be retained in their same grade for the following school year.  
    Please see the policy on Excessive Absences and the 24 Day Rule in the Attendance Section of this Handbook. 
                                 
    SUMMER SCHOOL 
     
    For students to be eligible for summer school they must have achieved a 60% or higher to be eligible to participate in 
    summer school classes.  The maximum number of classes allowed to be taken in the summer will be two. 
                                 
    HOMEBOUND INSTRUCTION 
    Homebound education is defined as carrying the public school program into the home through the visiting teacher.  The 
    primary purpose of the program is to help the physically handicapped child and those students with extended absences 
    due to illness or injury to maintain the continuity of their class work.  Students who are absent from school for an extended 
    period of time may receive homebound instruction if the attending physician and the parents request, in writing, this 
    service.  Students must be re-evaluated every three months by a physician.  A student on Homebound will receive a 
    maximum of five (5) hours instruction per week. 
     
    ACADEMIC DISHONESTY 
    Students are expected and required to complete their own work.  Use of AI <Artificial Intelligence= is not permitted. 
     
                                                          15 
                          STUDENT RECORDS 
     
    DISCLOSURE 
    School districts are permitted to disclose student records to state or local officials within the juvenile justice system.  
    School districts may also release records concerning disciplinary action taken against a student for conduct that posed a 
    significant risk to the safety or well-being of that student or to other members of the school community without prior 
    consent.  However, such disclosures should be limited only to those teachers or school officials who have a <legitimate 
    educational interest in the behavior of that student.= 
     
    REVIEW 
    Parents/guardians of students under age 18 have a right to inspect and review a student9s educational records by 
    contacting the Guidance Office and scheduling a time for the review.  If the student and/or parent finds inaccurate or 
    misleading information he/she should request, in writing, that the Principal review the inaccurate or misleading 
    information and consider altering the same.  No personal information will be disclosed without prior approval except as 
    stated in the previous section <Disclosure=. 
     
    Complaints regarding compliance with the Federal Educational Rights and Privacy Act may be filed with the U.S. 
    Department of Education. 
     
                                 
                                 
                        HEALTH OFFICE POLICIES 
      
    1. Students are to report to the nurse if they are ill, have an injury, or need to be evaluated for health 
    reasons.  Students may not use a cell phone or school building phones to call their parents to leave for health 
    problems.  If students use a cell phone or building phone to contact their parents without approval from the nurse, 
    the absence will be unexcused.  Students must be evaluated, and dismissed by the nurse if medically necessary to leave 
    school due to illness, injury, or other health reasons.  A parent can choose to take his/her child to the physician to get a 
    doctor9s excuse if the parent wishes for the absence to be considered an excused absence.  However, the student must 
    be evaluated by the physician the day the student left school and the excuse returned per the student handbook9s 
    absence procedures.  To be in compliance with attendance requirements, if students miss over 10 days of school and 
    leave school due to illness or injury, they must provide a doctor’s excuse for any absence from the school day.  The 
    school nurse is not able to provide the excuse for students with excessive absences.   
      
    2.  Please do not send your child to school and ask the nurse to diagnose your child’s health problem or previous 
    injury.  The nurse is not a physician, and under the Nurse Practice Act is not allowed to diagnose health conditions.  In 
    addition, if your child had an injury on the previous day, and is unable to participate in gym class; the school nurse 
    cannot excuse the student from gym class.  A doctor9s excuse is required.   
      
    3. The administration of medication to students by the nurse shall be permitted only upon the proper written 
    authorization by a physician (a signed physician9s order), and the student9s parent/ guardian’s written 
    consent.  This includes over- the-counter medications such as Tylenol and Advil.  The school nurse has medication 
    forms available in the health office, and available to download from the school nurses’ webpage.  Please note 
    that students must provide their own medications in the proper container labeled by the manufacturer or 
    pharmacy.  The school does not provide medications.  Students are not allowed to carry any medications with 
    them unless authorized by the school nurse.  In order to be permitted to carry medications, the student must 
    provide the school nurse with a physician9s order from the student9s physician stating that the student is 
    permitted to carry and self-administer the medication along with written parental consent.  Example:  inhalers and 
    emergency medications.  Any students carrying medications without a written physician9s order on file in the 
    health office, and permission from the nurse, are in violation of the school9s drug policy and may be 
    disciplined.  This is for the safety of all of the students in the district.   
       
                                                          16 
          4. Health History Forms will be passed out to students yearly, are available in the health office, and available to 
          download from the school nurses’ webpage.  It is very important to update this form yearly and return it to the nurse 
          so the nurse is aware of any health problems that may impact your child during the school day.  If you choose not to 
          indicate that your child has any health problems, we ask that you still sign and return the form so that the nurses know 
          that you received it.  If you, the parent/guardian, would like any teacher, bus driver, or any other staff member to be 
          made aware of your child9s health problems, it is your responsibility to notify them.  The nurse will not routinely share 
          this information except in an emergency situation or if the nurse determines that an employee has an immediate need 
          to know for the welfare of your child.  In addition, if you notify the teacher of your child9s health condition, and you 
          would also like the nurse to be made aware of the same, it is your responsibility to notify the nurse. 
            
          5. All students must abide by the school health law and have the required health screenings and immunizations 
          completed for that grade.  Dental exams are mandatory for students in grades K, 3, and 7.  Physical exams are 
          mandatory for students in grades K, 6, and 11.  For dental and physical exams, parents have the option of either having a 
          school dental/ physical exam free of charge, or taking their child to their private dentist/physician at their expense, and 
          returning a copy of the exam to the school nurse prior to the date of the school screening/exam.  Private Physical and 
          Dental forms are available in the nurses’ office, and available to download from the school nurses’ webpage.  Vision, 
          Height, Weight, and Body Mass Index (BMI) screenings will be done yearly as required by law.  Hearing Screenings will be 
          done for students in grades K, 1, 2, 3, 7, and 11 as required by law.  Scoliosis screenings will be done for all 7th grade 
          students as required by law.    
            
          6.  Students are not permitted to be in school with lice.  If a student is found to have lice during the school day, the 
          parent will be contacted and the child will be sent home.  Students will also be sent home if nits (lice eggs) are found 
          and the student was not recently treated with a lice shampoo.  It is the parent/guardian9s responsibility to properly 
          treat the lice, and return the student to school the next school day to be checked by the school nurse.   If the student 
          does not return to school the next school day, the student will only be excused for the day the student was sent home 
          by the nurse.   
           
          7.  Please address hygiene issues with your children at home.  Please be aware that children can be sensitive to odors, 
          such as odors from animals that may linger on clothing, chemicals, perfumes, and personal body odor.   
            
          8.  Extra clothes – The nurses recommend that all students carry an extra set of clothes in their backpacks or store in 
          lockers.  Many times extra clothes are needed for reasons such as bowel or bladder accidents, menstrual problems, 
          muddy/wet clothes, or food spills.  
           
          9.  Temperature checks – The District reserves the right to conduct temperature checks upon arrival for all employees, 
          students, and visitors throughout the school year and as warranted by increased illness. 
           
          Delivery and Storage of Medications 
           
          All medication shall be brought to the nurse9s office, or the main office if the nurse is in another building, by the 
          parent/guardian or by another adult designated by the parent/guardian. All medication shall be stored in the original 
          pharmacy-labeled container and kept in a locked cabinet designated for storage of medication. Medications that require 
          refrigeration shall be stored and locked in a refrigerator designated only for medications. The district shall not store 
          more than a thirty-day supply of an individual student9s medication. 
           
          Medication should be recorded and logged in with the date, name of student, name of medication, amount of 
          medication, and signatures of the parent/guardian or designated adult delivering the medication and the school health 
          personnel receiving the medication. 
           
          Nonprescription medication must be delivered in its original packaging and labeled with the student9s name. 
           
          Prescription medication shall be delivered in its original packaging and labeled with: 
           
          1.        Name, address, telephone and federal DEA (Drug Enforcement Agency) number of the pharmacy. 
                                                                                                                                                             17 
         2.       Student9s name. 
         3.       Directions for use (dosage, frequency and time of administration, route, special instructions). 
         4.       Name and registration number of the licensed prescriber. 
         5.       Prescription serial number. 
         6.       Date originally filled. 
         7.       Name of medication and amount dispensed. 
         8.       Controlled substance statement, if applicable. 
          
         All medication shall be accompanied by a completed Medication Administration Consent and Licensed Prescriber9s

                                                      ATTENDANCE REQUIREMENTS 
                                                                             
         GENERAL ATTENDANCE POLICY INFORMATION 
         Regular daily attendance is an integral part of an effective educational environment.  There is a positive relationship 
         between regular attendance and success in both school and the world of work.  Daily attendance contributes to a student9s 
         sense of responsibility, self-discipline, and good work habits.  Regular attendance is essential if students are to understand 
         the continuity of the curriculum and derive the maximum benefit from their fullest potential. 
          
         Compulsory school attendance is also a requirement in the Pennsylvania School Code.  Every child of compulsory school 
         age is required to be in attendance at school, unless absent for an approved reason.  Parents/guardians are charged with 
         the responsibility for their child9s/children9s school attendance.  School attendance is also mandated at the federal level, 
         with the federal law known as No Child Left Behind.  This law sets benchmarks for percent attendance rates to meet 
         Adequate Yearly Progress.    
          
         Because of state law and federal mandates, and to ensure the success of all students, the following attendance policies 
         detailed below have been developed:   
                                                                             
         WHEN A STUDENT IS ABSENT: 
         Any time your child misses school, or any part of the school day, you must submit a written excuse for the absence. 
         NOTE:  By state law, this written excuse MUST be received within 3 days of your child’s return to school.  If it is not 
         received within 3 days, the absence will be marked as unexcused.  THE ABSENCE WILL NOT BE CHANGED TO EXCUSED 
         IF THE WRITTEN EXCUSE IS SUBMITTED AFTER THE 3 DAY PERIOD. 
          
         When your child is absent you will receive a phone call from our automated calling system (School Reach) stating that 
         your child is absent.  You will receive a phone call in the morning and in the evening to inform you that your child was 
         absent from school.  If you receive this phone call and feel there is an error (your child was in school) or if you do not 
         receive a phone call when your child is absent, please contact the Middle School office so we can correct this.

          The superintendent will make the final decision on whether absences for these reasons will be considered Excused or 
          Unexcused.  If an absence is considered excused, it would be a cumulative absence and fall under this category (see  
          above for more information).

          Illness verified by a doctor’s note                   The doctor9s note must be submitted within 3 days of the student9s return. If

            Early dismissal will be granted under certain conditions for medical appointments.  When requesting an early dismissal, a 
            written request must be presented to the office at least one (1) day in advance of the requested day.  If a request is not 
            presented at least one (1) day in advance the parent/guardian will be required to come to the school and sign the student 
            out.  Parents must report to the office before picking up a student.  Students are responsible for all work missed due to 
            an early dismissal.  All students, regardless of age must adhere to this policy! 
             
            NOTE: A student must have a valid reason to be excused early from school.  If a student does not have a valid reason for 
            dismissal, the absence will be counted as an unexcused absence.  If a student has an early dismissal for a doctor 
            appointment, the student must provide a physician9s note within three (3) days of their return to school for the excuse to 
            be counted as an excused absence.  If a doctor9s note is not received within three (3) days, the absence will be considered 
            unexcused/illegal.

            If a student is absent from school for ten (10) consecutive school days, the student will be removed from the active 
            school roster unless one of the following occurs: 
                       a.  The district has been provided with evidence that the student9s absence may be legally excused 
                       b.  Compulsory attendance prosecution has been or is being pursued

                  B.  Students with attendance, academic, or discipline issues may not receive approval.  NOTE:  If the student has 
                        missed 10 cumulative days or 17 total days prior to submitting the request, or if the student will miss over 10 
                        cumulative days or 17 total days counting the trip, the request will NOT be approved.  Days missed will be 
                        considered as unexcused/illegal absences.    
                  C.  Students are permitted a maximum of 5 days total per school year for Educational Trips. 
                  D.  Students are responsible for getting work from their teachers PRIOR TO going on the trip.  Students should have

                        assignments and any make-up work. 
                  F.  Upon their return to school, students should turn in their assigned work.  They must also complete any other

                                                                               TRANSPORTATION POLICIES 
                                                                                                             
             SCHOOL BUS PROCEDURES 
             The transportation service provided by the West Branch Area Board of Education is a privilege which may be denied to 
             students who misbehave on the bus.  Students and parents/guardians must be aware of and observe the following 
             regulations: 
              
                   1.  The bus driver is in charge of maintaining discipline on the bus and has the authority to verbally reprimand any 
                          student who misbehaves. The bus driver may assign seats for students and may change seat assignments at any 
                          time in order to control student behavior. For their own safety all students are expected to remain seated at all 
                          times while the bus is in motion. 
                   2.  Bus riding privileges may be suspended for up to ten (10) days for misbehavior.  Examples: 
                                ●  Failing to follow reasonable instructions form the driver 
                                ●  Eating, drinking, or chewing gum on the school bus 
                                ●  Entering or leaving the bus at any other point than the front door 
                                ●  Not keeping arms, hands, and heads inside the bus at all times 
                                ●  Not keeping conversations at low volume, as prescribed by the bus driver.  There should be no shouting 
                                      or screaming, or any behavior which might endanger anyone9s safety. 
                          NOTE:  For serious or repeated offenses, a student may lose riding privileges for more than 10 days (possibly 
                                       for the remainder of the school year). 
                   3.  The parent/guardian must reimburse the bus contractor the full amount of repair/replacement costs or any 
                          intentional damage to a bus by a student. 
                   4.  In addition to suspension of riding privileges, misconduct on a school bus can also result in detention or 
                          suspension. 
                   5.  When a student9s bus privileges have been suspended, the parent/guardian will be notified by phone and/or in 
                          writing.  The parent/guardian will be responsible for the suspended student9s transportation and attendance 
                          during the suspension. 
              
                                                                                           STUDENT BUS RULES 
                                                                                                             
                                                                                                                                                                                                      25 
    NOTE: Parents are asked to keep your address correct with the school so that your child can receive the appropriate 
    transportation throughout the school year. It is also required that all students utilize their assigned bus stop on a daily 
    basis unless a note is present at the school and in the possession of the student; we ask that this be done so accurate 
    records are available in case of an emergency. 
     
    NOTE: Senate Bill 1077,  Act 56 of 2016. The bill permits those school districts engaging in video and audio 
    recording on school busses to fulfill the notification requirement, which originally required an annual notice to 
    be mailed home to each student, by including the policy in a student handbook and in any other publication of 
    the school entity that sets forth the comprehensive rules, procedures and standards of conduct for the school 
    entity as well as posting a notice of the policy on the district website. 
     
    LOADING AND UNLOADING AT THE BUS STOP  
      1.  Be at your assigned loading zone on time (5 minutes before pickup).  Buses cannot wait for late students and still 
        get to school on time. 
      2.  Exercise extreme caution in getting to and from your assigned bus stop. 
      3.  Look in both directions before stepping from behind parked cars. 
      4.  Stay well off the roadway until the bus comes to a complete stop and the bus driver indicates that it is safe to 
        board. 
      5.  Do not play on or near the road while waiting for the bus to arrive. 
      6.  Look in both directions before crossing the roadway. 
      7.  Never walk on the road when there is a sidewalk or pathway. 
      8.  Always walk on the left side of the road facing oncoming traffic and step off the road when a motor vehicle 
        approaches. 
      9.  Wait until the bus comes to a complete stop before trying to load or unload. 
      10. All articles of clothing or attachments that dangle or swing freely while a student is walking must be secured 
        before boarding the bus. 
      11. Use the handrail while getting on and off the bus. 
      12. If possible, wear white or light colored clothing or carry a flashlight if you walk on the roadway in the dark in 
        order that the motoring public can see you. 
      13. When you must cross the road to board or exit the bus, always cross at least 10 feet in front of the bus after 
        getting the <okay= from the driver. 
      14. Occasionally buses are delayed due to weather or traffic conditions.  Students should wait a reasonable amount 
        of time for a bus that is late.  Parental discretion is needed for the amount of time depending on weather 
        conditions. If a bus is more than fifteen minutes late please call the school office. 
     
    NOTE:  Due to the obvious lack of supervision the school can provide at bus stops, parents must assume responsibility 
    for the conduct and safety of their own child as they walk to (and from) the stop and wait for the bus.  Rules/regulations 
    of student conduct and appropriate behavior also apply at these times. Students who violate them are subject to the 
    school discipline code. Throwing rocks, snowballs or other harmful objects is not permitted at bus stops. 
      
     
     
    Bus Notes 
    West Branch Area SD may provide transportation to/from an alternate location, provided there is room available on the 
    route and the following guidelines are met: 
    1.  The alternate location is consistent five days per week for morning and afternoon.  Alternative locations will remain 
    the same for at least one semester.  Example:  Student may be transported from one location to school in the AM and 
    from school to another location in the PM. 
    2.  The alternate location is along a regularly scheduled route at a regularly scheduled stop. 
     
    WHILE ON THE BUS/GETTING ON THE BUS AT SCHOOL 
    The rules/policies for Riding the Bus and Getting on the Bus at School are included in the Discipline section of this 
    handbook.  Please read this section (Under School-Wide Positive Behavior Support).

    trips, assemblies, class trips, etc.).  Students will be ineligible to participate in extracurricular activities if any of the 
    following occur: 
     
    ACADEMIC ISSUES 
    Students must meet basic academic requirements to participate in extracurricular activities.  Students who have 
    academic issues (i.e. low grades, incomplete homework) will not be allowed to participate in extracurricular activities 
    until all work is made up.  In order to participate in any activities relating to the PSSA test, the student must participate 
    in the assessment. 
     
    ATTENDANCE 
    Any student accruing 17 days of absence will be ineligible to participate in extracurricular activities until the student is 
    present for 45 school days.  Any days the student is absent will not count toward the 45 day requirement. 
     
    Any student accruing 24 days of absence will be ineligible to participate in extracurricular activities for the remainder of 
    the school year. 
     
    Students must be in attendance the day of an event by 11:15 AM in order to be eligible to participate in practice. 
     
    Students will be ineligible to participate in a contest/performance if they are not in the building by 8:35am.  For students 
    to be eligible to participate in a Saturday contest/performance/event, attendance in school on Friday is required. 
     
    DISCIPLINE

    have any outstanding obligations to the district.  Examples would include: overdue lunch account balances, overdue 
    library books, vandalism, fundraising debts, etc.  Participation in extracurricular activities and field trips will be restored 
    when all obligations have been fulfilled. 
     
    Procedures and Expectations for Students on Overnight Trips 
    The West Branch Area School Board is supportive of our student groups when requesting overnight trips. These trips 
    many times allow for greater competition and the opportunity for our students to learn and/or improve their skills. We 
    also understand that there are many more risks for our students9 safety. To help keep our students safe the following 
    procedures and expectations will be in effect. 
                                                          27 
            1.       Rules:  All school rules apply during overnight trips. School rule violations preceding the trip may result in the 
            denial of attending the trip. Coaches/advisors will review these rules with students before the trip departs. Students are 
            reminded that they must respect each other and that there must be no bullying, harassment, hazing, fighting, or other 
            misconduct. Students should report any misconduct immediately to a coach/advisor. The staff will be even more vigilant 
            about enforcing school rules on the trip and students will face serious disciplinary action for any misconduct. Students 
            are expected to remain in their rooms at the direction of their coach/advisor and/or chaperone at all times. Violations 
            will result in administrative review. Following the review, disciplinary action up to and including removal from the 
            team/student group will be administered. Violations relating to drugs, alcohol, and/or weapons will result in an 
            immediate call to the appropriate authorities. 
            2.          Supervision: The coaches/advisors and their assistants/chaperones must supervise students whenever possible 
            during the trip, including in the middle of the night. Students are expected to adhere to all directives given by 
            coaches/advisors and/or chaperones. 
            3.          Searches: Searches of students9 personal property, purses, briefcases, backpacks, and bags, will be conducted if 
            there is reasonable suspicion that a student is violating school rules or the law. These searches may occur at any time; 
            before, during, and/or after the trip. Coaches/advisors and/or chaperones will be in contact with administration during 
            the search process. 
            4.       Release of Student: If a student has violated the law, such as by possessing drugs, alcohol, or a weapon, in 
            addition to calling the authorities, parents may be requested to retrieve their child from the trip. In the event of 
            parent/guardian refusal to retrieve their child from the trip, any associated costs to return the student will be the 
            responsibility of the parent/guardian. 
                                                         CAFETERIA PROCEDURES & GENERAL POLICIES 
            The goal of cafeteria services is to provide nutritious meals, within USDA-approved guidelines, to promote optimum 
            student performance in the classroom. Menus are published in Thursday9s issue of The Progress newspaper, and on local 
            radio station WPHB AM 1260.  Menus are posted in the cafeteria and circulated throughout classrooms and offices. 
            Menus are also posted on the school9s web page (www.westbranch.org). 
             
            At West Branch, students may choose whether or not to participate in lunch meal programs.  
             
            Teachers and/or monitors are responsible for maintaining an orderly and pleasant atmosphere in the cafeteria. 
            Shouting, unnecessary moving around, and boisterous behavior which interferes with a climate conducive to good 
            eating habits and a comfortable environment for all are not permitted. 
             
            MEAL PRICES AND BUYING PROCEDURES 
            West Branch is now participating in the CEP program.  This program is available to schools and districts that are 
            participating in the National School Lunch and School Breakfast Programs.   
            All enrolled students of West Branch Area School District are eligible to receive a nutritional breakfast and lunch each 
            school day at no charge to your household. 
                                                                                                                                                                                          28 
         No further action is required of you.  Your child(ren) will be able to participate in these meal programs without paying a 
         fee or submitting an application 
         Students will still have a cafeteria account and be able to purchase ala carte breakfast & lunch items.   
          
         A computerized pre-pay accounting system maintains student accounts and meal data. Students are to bring or parents 
         may send payments of cash or checks payable to West Branch Cafeteria for deposit into individual student accounts. 
         Payments should include name, homeroom, and amount enclosed to assure accuracy. Payment boxes are provided in 
         the office and cafeteria to collect payments every morning.  Payments must be deposited by 8:40 AM to ensure same 
         day credit.  Payment can also be made via the My School Bucks website, which can be accessed under the Food Service 
         tab on the West Branch website.  These accounts are debited as students purchase meals, milk, etc.   
          
         Students report to the cafeteria at their designated lunch time, receive their tray, and enter their individual PIN number. 
         The transaction is entered into the computer and the student9s individual account is debited. Warning notices appear on 
         the screens reminding the computer operator and students when accounts are low so payments can be made the next 
         day.   
          
         Students are encouraged to bring in payments without excessive reminders. Parents are also encouraged to keep 
         records at home so payments can be sent in a timely manner. This reduces paperwork and time spent maintaining the 
         system. A threshold is built into the system, which allows a day or two to make a payment after the first warning. 
         Individual student account information is available upon request. We encourage payments to be made in the form of a 
         check.  This ensures that we can track your child9s payments.  Cash payments are not traceable.  Large amounts of 
         change must be rolled.  We will not accept large amounts of loose change.  A $25.00 fee plus banking charges will be 
         charged for any returned checks. 
          
         As a matter of standard practice, refunds are processed for students who withdraw and graduating seniors, for account 
         balances over $2.00 after the end of the school year. The school reserves the right to initiate legal action for unpaid 
         negative account balances.  Students with negative account balances of $5.00 or more will also not be allowed to 
         participate in extracurricular activities (i.e. field trips, assemblies). 
                                                                        
                                                                        
                                                                        
                                                                        
          
          
                                               CAFETERIA ETIQUETTE AND PROCEDURES 
         The cafeteria is for the convenience of every pupil.  In addition to the school discipline code, students are to adhere to 
         the following:

                 and will result in disciplinary action.                    ●   Please be respectful of others. 
                                                                         
          
                                           INTERNET USE RULES AND REGULATIONS 
          
         The West Branch Area School District Acceptable Use Policy outlines all of the policies and regulations governing the 
         West Branch Area School District computer network.  Students and their parents/guardians must read the West Branch 
         Area School District Acceptable Use Policy, as well as the West Branch Area School District Acceptable Use Policy User 
         Agreement.   
          
                                                                                                                                  29 
    The West Branch Area School District Acceptable Use Policy User Agreement must be completed and signed by both the 
    student and the parent/guardian.  The signed form must then be returned to school.  A computer account for the 
    student will not be created until the West Branch Area School District Acceptable Use Policy User Agreement is 
    completed and signed by both the student and the parent/guardian, and returned to school. A copy of the West Branch 
    Area School District Acceptable Use Policy is located in Appendix C.

    SCHOOL-WIDE POSITIVE BEHAVIOR SUPPORT 
    In an effort to continue to improve our school climate, many of the staff at West Branch Middle School have worked 
    together to form a Positive Behavior Support (PBS) Committee. The focus of this committee, and all of the staff at West 
    Branch, is to continue to create a positive school climate that fosters cooperation, academic excellence, safety, respect, 
    and readiness. 
     
         We can Be safe – Keep your hands, feet, and objects to yourself.  Consider the personal space 
                         of others while remaining calm and in control of yourself. 
     We can Be respectful – Use language and actions that show concern and consideration toward all 
                          adults, fellow students, and school property. 
        We can Be ready – Be where you are supposed to be on time.  Have all of your materials  
                           (homework, pen/pencil, books, etc.) out and ready to go.  Be attentive. 
         
    The PBS program is a school wide behavior program.  Research shows us that students achieve at a higher level when 
    they know the expectations and feel safe. Positive Behavior Support will help us improve both of these. Our plan 
    provides detailed expectations in every area of the school while putting an extreme emphasis on safety, respect, and 
    readiness. 
     
    We are kicking off this program starting the first day of school with posters around the building and in classrooms and 
    classroom activities. All staff will take the time to teach their students the positive behaviors they are expected to 
    demonstrate at school, as well as the consequences for not following these behaviors. We will acknowledge and 
    reinforce students who consistently demonstrate these positive behaviors.   
     
    The success of our plan will improve with time and with the participation of our families. Research shows us that school 
    behavior plans that are followed in the home greatly improve their effectiveness in the school. Throughout this process, 
    West Branch Middle School will provide information to parents to help with home implementation of the Positive 
    Behavior Support Plan. 
     
     
    CONSEQUENCES AND DOCUMENTATION 
    Despite teaching, modeling and reinforcing expected behaviors within the school setting, students will make mistakes 
    and demonstrate poor choices. When inappropriate behaviors are displayed, students should be redirected and 
    reminded of appropriate behaviors. However, when students continue to display inappropriate behaviors, despite 
    redirection, or when students demonstrate behaviors that put others at risk, consequences for those behaviors must be 
    provided.  
     
    In order to increase tracking of student behavior, West Branch Middle School documents problem behaviors online. This 
    allows staff members to document a student9s inappropriate behavior via drop-down menu choices. Furthermore, staff 
    members are able to look up student9s discipline records and graph data based upon student, location, time, or 
    behavior. Graphs will be provided to staff members monthly to determine where additional interventions may be 
    needed.  
     
                                                          30 
    Minor Referral (previously referred to as level 1 and 2 infractions):  
     
    Level 1: Students who have been documented as displaying guidance concerns/Level 1 behaviors will not receive 
    consequences for these behaviors. The guidance concerns are logged so that students9 teachers and guidance 
    counselors may track changes in student behavior that could be related to mental health issues or significant changes in 
    students9 environment that could have an effect on educational success. 
     
    Level 2: Students who demonstrate classroom-managed behavior concerns should be re-taught/redirected following the 
    behavior.  
     
      ●  If the student has been retaught/redirected regarding a specific behavior, and that behavior continues, the 
        teacher should  1) reteach the appropriate behavior,  2) provide a classroom-based consequence, and 3) log the 
        behavior and the consequence within the discipline tracking system web site. 
      ●  If the student continues to demonstrate the inappropriate behavior, the teacher should  1) reteach the 
        appropriate behavior,  2) provide a classroom-based consequence, 3) contact the parent, and 4) log the 
        behavior, parent contact, and the consequence within the discipline tracking system web site. 
      ●  If the student continues to demonstrate the inappropriate behavior, the teacher should  1) reteach the 
        appropriate behavior,  2) provide a classroom-based consequence, 3) contact the parent, and 4) log the behavior 
        as an office referral:  Level 3: Repeated Disruption of Educational Environment. 
         
    Office Referrals (previously referred to as level 3 and 4 infractions): 
       
    Level 3 : Students who demonstrate office-managed behavior concerns should be immediately redirected.  
        If the classroom teacher does not provide a classroom-based consequence, the student will receive an office-
        based consequence (e.g., detention or ISS), and a consequence letter will be sent to the students9 
        parent/guardian. A signed copy of the consequence letter should be returned to the office the following day. 
      ●  If the classroom teacher provides a classroom-based consequence, it should be documented when the teacher 
        enters the infraction into the discipline tracking web site 
      ●  If the classroom teacher does not provide a classroom-based consequence, the student will receive an office-
        based consequence (i.e. detention, ISS, OSS), and a consequence letter will be sent to the student9s parent/ 
        guardian.  A signed copy of the consequence letter should be returned to the office the following day. 
         
    Level 4: When a student demonstrates a Level 4 behavioral concern, the behavior should immediately be logged and the 
    office administrator should immediately provide an office-based consequence

                                                                                                  Tier 2 
            West Branch Middle School staff members are providing continued redirection, modeling and reinforcement for 
            appropriate student behavior throughout the year. However, some students may still struggle to demonstrate expected 
            behaviors. These students may demonstrate internalizing, externalizing or organizational concerns. When staff members 
            (teachers or the Tier 1 team) identify such students, they should be referred to the Tier 2 team. The Tier 2 team will 
            determine if that student should be included in the Check-In/Check-Out program, or another individualized behavior 
            program depending on their needs.   
             
            The check-in/check-out (Partnering Our Warriors With Outstanding Warriors) program is a Check-In/Check-Out program, 
            which provides the means to respond positively to students who need extra support with their behavior.  On a daily basis, 
            staff can teach them appropriate behaviors and provide them with opportunities to practice them as they move from 
            activity to activity.   
             
            Additionally, the Tier 2 program provides for reinforcement and positive attention from adults.  The Tier 2 program also 
            provides for daily communication between a student and his/her teachers and between the school and parents.  In 
            addition, data is collected to determine whether the program is successful or changes need to be made. 
             
             
            The Tier 2 Program consists of a plan and process that allows students to: 
                  ●  Check in with a adult before school 
                  ●  Carry a tracking form 
                                                                                                                                                                                             32 
      ●  Ask their teacher to rate their behavior 
      ●  Check out at the end of each day 
      ●  Take the form home to parents 
      ●  Return the form the next day. 
    Tier 2 is designed to facilitate positive interactions between students with and assigned adults, teach good behavior skills, 
    and provide a means for home-school communication.  The WOW check-in creates a safe space for these students and 
    they learn to trust and respect the adults who are consistently there for them.  The program does not include negative 
    consequences  or  punishment,  only  encouragement  and  positive  attention.    Parents  are  encouraged  to  provide 
    reinforcement at home when the Tier 2 goal is met and consistently offer feedback and encouragement to their sons or 
    daughters.  
     
    If another behavior modification is needed, the team will work with the homeroom teacher to create this plan based on 
    the student9s needs. 
     
    Parents who would like to refer students to the Tier 2 program should contact your child9s advisory teacher.  
                          
                  DESCRIPTION OF DISCIPLINE CONSEQUENCE PENALTIES 
     
    LUNCH DETENTION 
    Students have modified seating during their lunch period.  
     
    DETENTION 
    Detention will be held from after school until 3:45 p.m.  Students are expected to serve detention on the assigned day.  
    Parents must pick up their children at the Middle School office at 3:45 – transportation home is not provided.  Students 
    must bring work to detention, as this is a silent work period.  
     
    FRIDAY SCHOOL 
    Friday School will be held from 2:45 PM – 5:45 PM on assigned Fridays.  All students must arrive promptly to the room 
    and have transportation home at 5:45.  Failure to bring school work or an AR book to read will result in an additional 
    assignment to Friday School.  Students will not be permitted to return to their classrooms to get school work.  Failure to 
    work on school work will result in an additional assignment to Friday School as well as other consequences.  
     
    ACADEMIC DETENTION 
    Academic Detention is an opportunity to get caught up on missing assignments.  It is not discipline related. 
     
    IN-SCHOOL SUSPENSION 
    Students who have ISS must report to the elementary office after announcements.  Students must have all necessary 
    materials (books, A.R. book, etc.) when they arrive at the ISS room.  Students must work on their assignments and are 
    not permitted to talk.  A formal list of rules is posted in the ISS room and must be followed at all times.  Students who 
    violate ISS/school rules will be disciplined according to the Discipline Sanction Chart.  Failure to complete any assigned 
    class work could result in a 0% for that assignment.  Students will be dismissed to their homeroom to get all materials to 
    take home. 
     
    OUT OF SCHOOL SUSPENSION 
    Students who receive OSS are not permitted on school property during the length of their suspension.  If the suspension 
    includes Friday, the student is not permitted on school property over the weekend.  The student is not permitted to 
    participate in any extracurricular activities during the length of the suspension (including weekends if the suspension 
    includes a Friday).  At the student or parent9s request, the guidance office will attempt to furnish assignments.  Students 
    are still responsible for all work. 
     
                         SEARCHES AND SEIZURES 
                                                          33 
      To maintain order and discipline in the schools and to protect the safety and welfare of students and school personnel, 
      school authorities may search a student, student9s locker and desk and may seize any illegal, unauthorized or 
      contraband materials discovered in the search.  Student desks and lockers are school property and may be searched at 
      any time by authorized school officials.  Periodic inspections of lockers and desks may be conducted at any time by 
      school personnel without notice. 
       
      Students9 personal effects (book bag, purse, athletic bag, etc.), as well as a motor vehicle parked on school property, 
      may be searched if there is a reasonable suspicion to believe that illegal or unauthorized materials may be found, or that 
      the student is violating law, school board policy or school rules, or poses a threat to the student or the school 
      population.  Searches conducted by the administration may include, but not be limited to, utilization of certified drug 
      dogs or any device used to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the student and the school population.  A student9s 
      failure to permit searches and seizures will result in a 5-day suspension and possible police contact. 
                                                    
                                                    
                                          VIDEO SURVEILLANCE 
      To ensure the safety of all students and visitors, the high school building is equipped with video cameras and recording 
      devices.  All students and visitors who enter the high school building acknowledge that they are subject to video 
      surveillance upon entering the building.  These recordings may be used as evidence against the student/visitor in 
      disciplinary, juvenile, or criminal proceedings.   
       
                                          REASONABLE FORCE 
      Reasonable force may be used by teachers, staff, and school administrators to protect the health, safety, and welfare of 
      all students, staff, and visitors. 
       
                                        TOBACCO & VAPE POLICY

    result in disciplinary action. All complaints will be sent to the Title IX coordinator for action. 
     
                             HEARINGS 
    Education is a statutory right, and students must be afforded all appropriate elements of due process if they are to be 
    excluded from school.  In a case involving a possible expulsion, the student is entitled to a formal hearing, which is a 
    fundamental element of due process (see West Branch Area School District Policies #219 and #233). 
     
                            DRESS CODE 
    The Board recognizes that each student's mode of dress and grooming is a manifestation of personal style and individual 
    preference. The Board has the authority to impose limitations on students' dress in school. The Board will not interfere 
    with the right of students and their parents/guardians to make decisions regarding their appearance, except when their 
    choices disrupt the educational program of the schools or affect the health and safety of others. 
     
    Students may be required to wear certain types of clothing while participating in physical education classes, technical 
    education, extracurricular activities, or other situations where special attire may be required to ensure the health or 
    safety of the student. 
     
    The building principal or designee shall be responsible to monitor student dress and grooming and to enforce Board 
    Policy and school rules governing student dress and grooming. The Superintendent or designee shall ensure that all rules 
    implementing this policy impose only the minimum necessary restrictions on the exercise of the student's taste 
    and individuality. Staff members shall be instructed to demonstrate by example positive attitudes toward neatness, 
    cleanliness, propriety, modesty, and good sense in attire and appearance. 
     
    Therefore, these rules can be changed at the discretion of the School Board and/or the Administration.  The following 
    is a list of guidelines and inappropriate articles of clothing or accessories which are expressly forbidden:

    JEWELRY/ACCESSORIES – PHYSICAL EDUCATION JEWELRY POLICY 
     
    Introduction 
     
    This Physical Education Jewelry Policy has been established to provide guidelines for students who wish to wear jewelry 
    during physical education classes. While jewelry is generally allowed, it is essential to ensure the safety and well-being of 
    all students. Therefore, parents and guardians will be held liable for any potential injuries or damages resulting from the 
    wearing of jewelry during physical education activities. 
     
    Policy Guidelines 
     
    1. Permission to Wear Jewelry: Students are permitted to wear jewelry during physical education classes. However, it is 
    encouraged to keep jewelry to a minimum to minimize potential risks. 
     
    2. Safety Considerations: Students must consider the potential safety risks associated with wearing jewelry during 
    physical activities. It is strongly recommended that students remove any jewelry that may pose a risk, such as dangling 
    or sharp-edged items. Jewelry that may interfere with safe and effective participation in physical education activities 
    should be taken off. 
     
                                                          36 
    3. Liability: Parents and guardians of students are solely responsible for any injuries or damages resulting from the 
    wearing of jewelry during physical education classes. The school and its staff will not be held liable for any accidents or 
    incidents involving jewelry worn by students. 
     
    4. Notification and Consent: Before the start of the school year, parents or guardians will be informed of this policy and 
    its implications. They must provide written consent acknowledging that they understand the risks associated with 
    wearing jewelry during physical education activities and that they will assume liability for any potential injuries or 
    damages. 
     
    5. Storage of Jewelry: Students are responsible for the safe storage of their jewelry during physical education classes. 
    The school will not be held liable for lost or stolen jewelry. It is advisable to use lockers or designated storage areas for 
    valuable items. 
     
    6. Regular Monitoring: The physical education instructor will regularly remind students about the policy and the 
    importance of adhering to safety guidelines regarding jewelry. They will also have the authority to address any safety 
    concerns during physical education activities. 
     
    This Physical Education Jewelry Policy aims to strike a balance between allowing students the freedom to wear jewelry 
    while participating in physical education classes and ensuring the safety and well-being of all students. By providing clear 
    guidelines and involving parents and guardians in the decision-making process, we aim to create a safe and inclusive 
    learning environment for all students. It is essential for parents and guardians to understand the risks involved and 
    accept liability for their child's choice to wear jewelry during physical education activities. 
     
    Physical Education Dress Code 
     
    The following dress code is established to ensure the safety, comfort, and optimal participation of all students in 
    physical education classes. Please adhere to these guidelines when selecting your attire for physical education sessions: 
     
    General Guidelines: 
     
    1. Athletic Attire: Students are required to wear appropriate athletic attire suitable for physical activities. This includes 
    sportswear that allows for ease of movement and breathability. 
     
    2. Footwear: Athletic shoes (Sneakers) with non-marking soles and proper support are mandatory. Sandals, flip-flops, 
    crocs, and open-toed shoes are not allowed for safety reasons. 
     
    3. Weather Considerations: Dress according to the weather conditions. In colder weather, students may wear additional 
    layers, such as sweatshirts or long-sleeved athletic shirts. 
     
    4. Medical Conditions: If a student has a medical condition that requires specific attire or accommodations, they should 
    provide a doctor's note outlining the necessary modifications. 
     
     
    This dress code is implemented to promote a safe and inclusive environment in physical education classes, allowing all 
    students to engage comfortably and participate fully. It is essential to follow these guidelines to ensure the well-being 
    and safety of everyone involved in physical activities. If you have specific concerns or require accommodations, please 
    contact your physical education instructor in advance. 
     
    HEADWEAR/HAIR 
    1.  Hats, caps, bandanas, hoods, sunglasses, visors, sweatbands, and other head coverings are not permitted.   
         They must be taken off upon entering the building, and left in the proper designated area. 
    2.  Students are not permitted to carry headwear to classes or in the hallway during the school day. 
    3.  Hair coloring of a fluorescent or distracting color shall not be permitted.   
    4.  Hairstyle should be acceptable to the school setting. 
                                                          37 
     
    HEALTH AND HYGIENE 
    1.  Any apparel that is judged to be unhealthy or unsanitary (i.e. clothing that is dirty and/or gives off a foul 
         odor) is not permitted. 
    2.  Each student is expected to maintain good personal hygiene. 
     
                   CELL PHONES AND MUSIC/ELECTRONIC DEVICES 
                                 
    Cell phones and electronic devices are not to be used in the school building between the hours of 7:45 a.m. and  
    2:45 p.m. (prior to bus dismissal).  Any cell phones or music/electronic devices used by students or visible to staff during 
    these hours will be considered a violation of this policy.  It is also a violation to use cell phones on the bus for purposes 
    or recording or taking videos or pictures of any kind. Violations will be dealt with according to the School-Wide Positive 
    Behavior Support system. 
     
    NOTE: Any student refusing to turn over a cell phone or music/electronic device to staff will be suspended out of 
    school until a parent meeting is held. 
     
    STUDENTS ARE NOT PERMITTED TO TAPE OR RECORD EVENTS IN THE CLASSROOM, ANYWHERE IN THE BUILDING, OR 
    ON THE BUS, UNLESS ADMINISTRATIVE APPROVAL IS GIVEN (i.e. for a class project).   
     
    THE SCHOOL IS NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE LOSS OF A CELL PHONE OR ELECTRONIC DEVICE (i.e. Nintendo DS, MP3 
    player, etc.).  THE SCHOOL WILL NOT SEARCH FOR LOST DEVICES, AS POSSESSION OF THEM IS A VIOLATION OF 
    SCHOOL POLICY. 
     
     
                           DRUG POLICY 
                                 
    The Drug Policy chart (see APPENDIX D) details guidelines for discipline based on listed offenses.  Discipline given to 
    students may be increased or decreased based on the specific infraction(s). 
     
    NOTE: Students having assessments as a result of policy violations must comply by those recommendations at parental      
                expense or be subject to exclusion from school. A timetable will be set. 
     
     
            PROGRAMS FOR ELIGIBLE OR PROTECTED HANDICAPPED STUDENTS 
     
    In compliance with the state and federal law, notice is hereby given by the West Branch Area School 
    District that it conducts ongoing identification activities as a parts of its school program for the purpose of

   Dear Parents / Guardians: 
    
   West Branch Area School District has an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Program for control of insects, rodents and 
   weeds.  Our IPM Program focuses on making the school building and grounds an unfavorable habitat for pests by removing 
   food and water sources and eliminating pests9 hiding and breeding places.  We accomplish this through routine cleaning 
   and maintenance.  We monitor the school buildings and grounds to detect any pests that are present.  The pest monitoring 
   team consists of our building maintenance, office, and teaching staff, as well as our students.  Pest sightings are reported to 
   our IPM Coordinator who evaluates the 8pest problem9 and determines the appropriate pest management techniques to 
   address the problem.  The techniques can include increased sanitation, modifying storage practices, sealing entry points, 
   physically removing the pest, etc. 
    
   From time to time, it may be necessary to use chemicals to control a pest problem.  Chemicals will only be used when 
   necessary and will not be routinely applied.  When chemicals are used, the school will try to use the least toxic products 
   possible.  Applications will be made only when teachers and students do not have access to the area(s) being treated.  
   Notices will be posted in these areas 72 hours prior to application and for two days following the application. 
    
   Parents or guardians of students enrolled in the school may request prior notification of specific pesticide applications 
   made at the school.  To receive notification, you must request to be placed on the school9s 8Notification Registry9.  If you 
   would like to be placed on this registry, please send a signed letter to your child9s principal requesting to be added to the 
   registry.  Each year the district will prepare a new Notification Registry. 
    
   If a chemical application must be made to control an emergency pest problem, notice will be provided by telephone to any 
   parent or guardian who has requested such notification.  Exemptions to this notification include disinfectants and anti-
   microbial products; self-containerized baits placed in areas not accessible to students, and gel type baits placed in cracks, 
   crevices or voids. 
    
   This letter conforms to the requirements of the Integrated Pest Management Act 35 of 2002 and assures parents and 
   guardians of our commitment to continue providing the safest atmosphere possible for our students.  If you have any 
   questions, please contact Mr. David Catherman, IPM Coordinator at 345-5627. 
    
    
   Sincerely,

    Please read the following Acceptable Use Policy carefully before signing the attached User Agreement 
    (page 5).  No account will be created until the User Agreement has been signed and returned. 
     
    New technologies are shifting the ways that information may be accessed, communicated, and transferred.  Those changes may 
    also alter instruction and student learning.  West Branch Area School District offers students and staff members access to the 
    electronic information highway and the Internet. 
     
    Along with access to computers and people all over the world, comes the availability of materials that may not be considered 
    appropriate in the classroom.  However, on a global network it is impossible to control all materials.  Ultimately, the school 
    staff and parents/guardians of minors are responsible for setting and conveying the sources.  West Branch Area School District 
    supports and respects each family’s right to decide whether or not to allow their child to apply for access to the Internet. 
     
    Students are responsible for good behavior on school computer networks just as they are in a classroom or school hallway.  
    Communications on networks are often public in nature.  General school rules for behavior and communications apply. 
     
    West Branch Area School District Internet is provided for the student to conduct research and communicate with others in 
    relation to school and community work.  Access to network services is given to students who agree to act in a considerate and 
    responsible manner.  Parents/guardians permission is required, by signing the Acceptable Use Policy.  Access is a privilege, not 
    a right. Teachers and the administration will deem what is inappropriate use and provide appropriate sanctions, if deemed 
    necessary.   
     
                           Educational Purpose 
    The West Branch Area School District computer network has been established for a limited educational purpose. The term 
    <educational purpose= includes classroom activities and career development activities. The West Branch Area School District 
    computer network has not been established as a public access service or a public forum. The West Branch Area School District 
    has a right to place reasonable restrictions on the material you access or post through the system. You are expected to follow the 
    rules set forth in the Student Handbook, as well as the law, in your use of the West Branch Area School District computer 
    network.  You may not use the West Branch Area School District computer network for commercial purposes. This means you 
    many not offer, provide, or purchase products or services through the network. 
     
                          Student Internet Access 
    All students will have access to Internet World Wide Web information resources through their classroom, library, or school 
    computer lab. The District will utilize filtering software or other technologies to prevent students from accessing visual 
    depictions that are (1) obscene, (2) child pornography, or (3) harmful to minors. Educational staff will, to the best of their 
    ability, monitor minors' use of the Internet in school, and will take reasonable measures to prevent access by minors to 
    inappropriate material on the Internet and World Wide Web, and restrict their access to materials harmful to minors. 
     
                           Unacceptable Uses 
    Personal Safety. Students/staff will not post personal contact information about yourself or other people. Personal contact 
    information includes your address, telephone, school address, work address, social security number, credit card number, etc. 
    You will promptly disclose to your teacher or other school employee any message you receive that is inappropriate or that 
    makes you feel uncomfortable. Personally identifiable information concerning students will not be disclosed or used in any way 
    on the Internet without the permission of a parent or guardian. 
     
    Email, Blogging, Chat, and Instant Messaging. Students/staff will not use commercial Web-based mail (Hotmail, 
    YahooMail, etc.) on any school computer, or any type of instant messaging including, but not limited to, AOL Instant 
    Messenger, MSN Messenger, and ICQ. You are not permitted to contribute to weblogs or to be in online Web-based chat rooms 
    unless it is part of a collaborative sharing project under the direct supervision of a teacher and are prohibited from using IRC 
    chat programs on any school computer. 
     
    Social Networking Sites.  Accessing Social Networking websites from the West Branch Area School District computer

    Illegal Activities. Students/staff will not attempt to gain unauthorized access to the West Branch Area School District computer 
    network or to any other computer system through the West Branch Area School District computer network or go beyond your 
    authorized access (<hacking=). This includes attempting to log in through another person’s account or accessing another 
    person’s files. These actions are illegal, even if only for the purpose of <browsing.= You will not make deliberate attempts to 
    disrupt the computer system or destroy data by spreading computer viruses or by any other means. These actions are illegal. 
    You will not use the West Branch Area School District computer network to engage in any other illegal act, such as arranging 
    for a drug sale or the purchase of alcohol, engaging in criminal gang activity, threatening the safety of a person, etc. 
     
    System Security. You are responsible for your individual account and should take all reasonable precautions to prevent others 
    from being able to use your account. Under no conditions should you provide your password to another person. You will 
    immediately notify a teacher or the system administrator if you have identified a possible security problem.  
     
    Inappropriate Language/Harassment. Restrictions against inappropriate language apply to public messages, private 
    messages, and material posted on Web pages. Students/staff must not use the system to create, send, receive, or use any 
    offensive or disruptive materials or messages. Messages which are considered to be offensive include, but may not be limited 
    to, those which contain sexual implications, racial slurs, gender-specific comments, or any other comments that offensively 
    address someone’s sex, sexual orientation, religious or political beliefs, national origin, or disability. Also considered offensive 
    are messages or materials which are fraudulent, harassing, or obscene, and those which contain abusive, profane, or offensive 
    language. You will not post information that could damage or endanger another’s reputation. You will not engage in personal 
    attacks, including prejudicial or discriminatory attacks. You will not harass another person. Harassment is persistently acting in 
    a manner that distresses or annoys another person. If you are told by a person to stop sending them messages, you must stop. 
    You will not knowingly or recklessly post false or defamatory information about a person or an organization. 
     
    Respecting Resource Limits. Students/staff will use the system only for educational activities. You will not download any 
    files. Loading or use of unauthorized games, programs, files, or other electronic media is prohibited.  No software is to be 
    installed onto the network by students at any time for any purpose. You will not post chain letters or engage in <spamming.= 
    Spamming is sending an annoying or unnecessary message to a large number of people.  Students/staff will be given a set 
    amount of space on the network server to save appropriate/educational data.  Students/staff should periodically review the 
    information saved on their server location and delete any outdated and/or unnecessary information. 
     
    Plagiarism and Copyright Infringement. Students/staff will not plagiarize works that you find on the Internet. Plagiarism is 
    taking the ideas or writings of others and presenting them as if they were yours. You will respect the rights of copyright owners. 
    Copyright infringement occurs when you inappropriately reproduce a work that is protected by a copyright. If a work contains 
    language that specified appropriate use of that work, you should follow the expressed requirements. If you are unsure whether 
    or not you can use a work, you should request permission from the copyright owner. Copyright law can be very confusing. If 
    you have questions, ask a teacher. 
     
    Inappropriate Access to Material. Students/staff will not use the West Branch Area School District computer network to 
    access material that is profane or obscene (pornography), that advocates illegal acts, or that advocates violence or discrimination 
    towards other people (hate literature). A special exception may be made for hate literature if the purpose of your access is to 
    conduct research and both your teacher and parent have approved. If you mistakenly access inappropriate information, you 
    should immediately tell your teacher or another District employee. This will protect you against a claim that you have 
    intentionally violated this Policy. Your parents should instruct you if there is additional material that they think would be 
    inappropriate for you to access. The district fully expects that you will follow your parents’ instructions in this matter. 
     
    Vandalism.  Vandalism is defined as any malicious attempt to harm or destroy data of another user, hardware or software 
    utilized on the network, hardware or software with any individual device, or other networks that are connected to the West 
    Branch Area School District computer network.  Vandalism by a user will result in immediate cancellation of privileges.  No 
    user shall upload, download, or create computer viruses.  You will be responsible for any damages done to the equipment, 
    system, and software. 
     
                             Future Rules 
    Additional rules and restrictions may be added if the need arises.  Students and staff are responsible for reading and following 
    these rules. 
     
                                                          45 
                              Security 
    Monitoring 
    The West Branch Area School District reserves the right to log, monitor and review Internet, E-mail and other network use of 
    each user. This logging, monitoring and review may be conducted without cause and without notice. Each user of a West 
    Branch Area School District's computer by the use thereof agrees and consents to such logging, monitoring and review and 
    acknowledges that s/he has no right or expectation of confidentiality or privacy with respect to Internet, E-mail or other network 
    usage. Network storage areas may be treated like school lockers. Network administrators may review student and staff files and 
    communications to maintain system integrity and ensure that students and staff are using the system only for appropriate 
    purposes. Users should expect that files stored on district servers or computers will not be private.  
     
    Electronic Mail (E-Mail) 
    Users of the network are hereby notified that the West Branch Area School District administration has the authority to intercept 
    and monitor e-mail messages of all persons using the West Branch Area School District computer network. The West Branch 
    Area School District does not recognize the right to privacy of any user or the statements, writings, graphics, e-mail messages or 
    other electronic or video transmissions of any user as a result of access over or through the West Branch Area School District 
    computer network.  All users are bound by the Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986, as amended, and the 
    Communications Decency Act, which prohibit the unauthorized interception or disclosure of e-mail messages by third parties, 
    as well as the appropriateness of certain material being remitted on the Internet. No user shall intercept or disclose any 
    information garnered as result of access to the West Branch Area School District computer network without the consent of the 
    sender or receiver of the communication. The Act recognizes that the West Branch Area School District may monitor an 
    employee’s e-mail messages, as long as the interception device is included in the e-mail equipment. 
     
    Search and Seizure.  The West Branch Area School District reserves and intends to exercise the right to review, audit, 
    intercept, access, and disclose all uses of the system. The contents of electronic communications may be disclosed within the 
    West Branch Area School District or to law enforcement officials without the permission of the author. You should not assume 
    confidentiality of any material produced. Even when the material is erased from the system, it is usually possible to retrieve that 
    material. Further, the use of passwords for security does not guarantee confidentiality or privacy. Routine maintenance and 
    monitoring of the West Branch Area School District computer network may lead to discovery that you have violated this Policy, 
    the provisions of the Student Handbook, or the law. An individual search will be conducted if there is reasonable suspicion that 
    you have violated this Policy, the provisions of the Student Handbook, or the law. The investigation will be reasonable and 
    related to the suspected violation. Your parents have the right at any time to request to see the contents of your files. 
     
    Due Process. The West Branch Area School District will cooperate fully with local, state, or federal officials in any 
    investigation related to any illegal activities conducted through the West Branch Area School District computer network. If the 
    violation also involves a violation of other provisions of the Student Handbook, it will be handled in a manner described in the 
    Student Handbook. Additional restrictions may be placed on your use of your Internet account. 
     
    District Limitation of Liability.  The West Branch Area School District makes no warranties of any kind, whether express or 
    implied, for the service it is providing. The school district is not responsible, and will not be responsible, for any damages, 
    including loss of data resulting from delays, non-deliveries, missed deliveries, or service interruption. Use of any information 
    obtained through the use of the West Branch Area School District’s computer network is at the user's risk. The West Branch 
    Area School District disclaims responsibility for the accuracy or quality of information obtained through the Internet or E-mail. 
     
    Filtering.  The West Branch Area School District has provided a filtering solution for the district in compliance with the 
    Children Internet Protection Act, a federal law. Filtering is being done based on certain categories as determined by the 
    administration of the school district. Though filtering is being provided, it is to be considered neither a failsafe system nor a 
    guarantee that all controversial or inappropriate materials are blocked. Students and staff should follow proper procedures and 
    report any sites that may be deemed inappropriate to the computer department so that steps may be taken to block those sites. 
    Users who access inappropriate sites or fail to report unblocked inappropriate sites may find themselves losing their Internet 
    privileges. 
     
                        VIOLATIONS OF THIS POLICY 
    Violation of the West Branch Area School District’s Acceptable Use Policy in any way may result in loss of the privilege to 
    access the Internet or other technology resources provided by the school. Other disciplinary action may be taken in accordance 
    with existing West Branch Area School District policies and will be tailored to meet specific concerns related to the violation. 
    When necessary, the District may call in law enforcement agencies. The district will cooperate fully with local, state or federal 
    officials in any investigation concerning or relating to any illegal activities conducted through the district system.

           Purpose  
           The Board recognizes the challenges encountered by students experiencing homelessness, foster care and other 
           educational instability. The Board is committed to facilitating the immediate enrollment; eliminating barriers to the 
           attendance, education and graduation; and providing additional supports in compliance with federal and state laws, 
           regulations and Board policy, for such students.[1][2][3][4][5] [6][7][8]  
           Authority 
           The Board directs the district to collaborate with school staff, other school districts, local agencies and other entities in 
           supporting the needs of students experiencing educational instability.  
           The Board shall ensure that students experiencing educational instability have equal access to the same educational 
           programs, activities and services provided to other district students.[1][2][3][4][5][6][7]  
                                                                                                                                                               49 
    The Board authorizes the Superintendent to waive specific requirements in Board policies, procedures and 
    administrative regulations to the extent that they create barriers for the enrollment and attendance of students 
    experiencing educational instability. Such waivers include, but are not limited to, requirements 
    regarding:[1][2][3][4][5][6][7]  
    1. Dress code.[9]  
    2. Transportation.[10]  
    3. School-sponsored or extracurricular activities for which students meet placement and qualification requirements, 
    including, but not limited to, clubs, athletics, performing arts, class trips, social events, career and technical education, 
    internships and specialized classes.[11][12][13][14][15] [16][17]  
    4. Fees related to school-sponsored or extracurricular activity participation fees, and other fees including, but not 
    limited to, school identification (badges, cards, etc.), uniforms, materials, lost or damaged items, athletic physical exams, 
    parking or driving, food services, library, locker or padlock rental or replacement, summer school or credit recovery, 
    technology and graduation regalia.[9][13][14][15][18] [19] [20][21][22]  
    5. Graduation.[19]  
    6. Registration deadlines.  
    It is the policy of the Board that no student shall be discriminated against, segregated or stigmatized based on their 
    status as a student experiencing educational instability.
