                            Questions and Answers 
                 Q. Is this Policy primary or secondary coverage? 
                      A. This policy is Primary Excess — meaning A-G will pay the first $100 in 
                        valid medical expenses payable without regard to any other valid and 
                        collectible insurance plan. Once expenses have exceeded $100, A-G 
                        will make payments in excess of any other valid and collectible 
                        insurance. 
                 Q.  May we purchase the policy at any time during the year? 
                     A. Yes, coverage may be purchased at any point in time during the school 
                        year for your child. However, there is no pro-rating of premium for 
                        enrollment that occurs after the policy effective date. The earlier you 
                       enroll the more your child will maximize their coverage. 
                 Q. Will this policy pay if our other insurance has a deductible? 
                     A. Yes, this policy does not have deductible. You should submit expenses 
                       in excess of $100 to your other insurance carriers and forward a copy 
                       of the itemized bill and explanation of benefits showing the amount of 
                       the deductible. 
                             How to 
                                     File a 
                                           Claim 
          1.  Obtain an accident claim form through your school office or A-G Administrators LLC Please answer all 
            questions and provide all necessary signatures. 
          2.  Attach all itemized bill(s) and any explanation of benefits to the claim form and mail or fax to the 
            Administrator's Address indicated on the claim form. 
          3.  Claims for benefits must be filed within 90 days from the date of accident. Only one claim 
            form is needed per accident.
