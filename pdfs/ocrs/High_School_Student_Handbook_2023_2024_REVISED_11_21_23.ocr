PRINCIPAL'S MESSAGE

Dear Parents and Guardians,

This handbook is intended to provide a brief, concise, and understandable overview of some of the most important
opportunities, general rules, guidelines, policies, and expectations about our high school. It is not intended to be all
inclusive; its contents may be subject to change. Please take the time to review this handbook thoroughly as it can be an
important source of information for both students and parents. Your questions and concerns are important to me;
therefore, please contact me as needed. In addition, the other administrators, faculty, and staff are here to help as well,
so call upon any of them at any time. It is important to me that the school and community form a strong alliance. Get

involved where and when you can. With mutual respect and support, we can make anything possible.

School Closings

Should it become necessary to close school (due to weather, power outage, etc.), an announcement will be made on the
local radio and television stations and via Alert Solutions. The school’s phone system will also be used to contact parents
for two (2) hour delays and early dismissal announcements. Please do not call the school or the radio/TV stations. The
following stations should be broadcasting any delay or cancellation information: WPSU, Fox 8 WWCP, ABC 23 WATM,
WTAJ, WJAC, and WOKW 102.9 FM. In addition, the information will be posted on the West Branch School District
Facebook page.

West Branch parents are encouraged to provide cell phone information as texts have the quickest delivery time when
messages are sent. Currently, if you are able to login to the PowerSchool website, you have the ability to change your
contact information. This will allow you to select your preferred method of contact.

School Delays

A school day involving a 2-hour delay will begin at 10:00 AM. Students will be attending 1° period from 10:00 — 10:18 and
then moving on to their regular schedule. Driving conditions and other factors will certainly be given consideration when
determining tardies on days involving inclement weather.

FID (Flexible Instructional Days)

During the 2023-2024 School Year, West Branch Area School District will be utilizing Flexible Instruction Days (FIDs)
which may be used in place of a school day that would be canceled because of inclement weather or another emergency
situation. On a FID, students will complete learning activities and assignments provided by their teachers. Implementing
a FID will not require additional make-up days when school is canceled. The District can use up to five (5) FIDs per school
year. Students and parents/guardians will be informed of a FID through the District's notification systems in the same
way that school closings and delays are currently announced.

9
What will be expected of my child during a FID (grades 3-12)?

Students in grades 3 through 12 will download offline FID lessons to their device prior to the FID day. Students with
internet may log on to Google Classroom to access assignment information. Students are expected to complete all
lessons during the FID day. Students will submit/return their assignments upon their return to school the next day. Any
student who fails to complete their FID assignments on their FID day, will be marked as absent unexcused from school
and will receive a zero on any graded assignment that was not submitted.

What will be expected of my child during a FID (grades PreK-2)?

Elementary students will work on FID lessons unique to their grade level. Students will receive a FID folder with 5
lessons. Students are expected to complete all lessons during the FID day. Students will submit/return their assignments
upon their return to school the next day. Any student who fails to complete their FID assignments on their FID day, will
be marked as absent unexcused from school and will receive a zero on any graded assignment that was not submitted.

completion and understanding. Any related services (Physical Therapy, Occupational Therapy, Speech, etc.) scheduled
during the FID will be rescheduled according to the frequency requirements of the students’ individualized education
plan.

Will after school activities be canceled on a FID?
After school activities may be cancelled based on the nature of the event that led to the FID day.

Remote Learning Guidelines and Etiquette

During remote learning sessions, the following guidelines will be in effect. In an effort to create a positive and
productive environment for all learners:

e Students must attend the class, remote session, and return digitally when directed, and/or complete the
asynchronous learning activity.

10
e Students must have their video on during the entire class session to be considered present, unless formal
arrangements have been made with the teacher.

e §=Attendance is required at all sessions. Staff will take attendance.

games while in a meeting)

CTC Students — 2 Hour Delay

The AM students of the CTC will depart as close to 9:55 AM as possible in order to arrive at the CTC at their usual time.
They will report directly to the CTC bus upon their arrival to school. Attendance will be done at the CTC. All AM CTC
students will return to WB at 11:40 and should report directly to their 5" period class as indicated by their individual
schedule. The PM CTC students will be reported to 3% period just like everyone else and leaving for the CTC at their usual
time. If there are any changes to the current plans, all of the students will be notified.

CTC Students — Activity Day/Pep Assembly
The departure and the return times for the AM students will remain the same. Upon return, the AM students would
report to their 5" period class or to B Lunch depending on their respective schedules.

The PM students who are staying for the pep rally will be assigned to rooms after they have attended their 5" period class
and lunch. Those PM students choosing to attend the CTC will depart at 11:30 AM.

CTC Students — Attendance

The CTC places a high priority on instructional time in which a student is actively engaged in learning while in attendance
in the classroom or lab; therefore, it is imperative that each student strive to maintain a good attendance record while
enrolled in one of the programs.

Students from the West Branch HS can be excused from the CTC throughout the school year for events such as pep rallies,
assemblies, or make up work. Athletic events and academic related functions (Envirothon, etc.) are excused as applicable.
Students must receive approval if they want to remain at the home school for the day. Approval to stay all day at the CTC
must be granted by principals at both schools (CTC and WB). Academics at both schools will be a big factor in the decision
to grant approval.

All unexcused absences at the CTC are recorded by the teacher and the student receives a zero for that day.

Expectations for Activity Day Meetings

Students are to report for meetings when they are scheduled. Likewise, students who leave a class to attend a meeting
must be a member of the club and/or be included on the roster that is sent to teachers prior to activity day events. If you
leave a class under false pretenses, you may be subject to disciplinary referral. Sometimes a student will have more than
one meeting scheduled at the same time.

11
Unfortunately, the student will have to choose which meeting to attend and then be sure to see the advisor for the one
that is missed. When the meetings are completed, the students are to go directly back to class or move on quickly to their
next meeting.

Expectations for Pep Assemblies

Students will be dismissed to go to assemblies and pep rallies via the public address system. At the appropriate time,
students should move quickly and quietly to assigned areas in the auditorium or gym with their teacher. All students must
sit in their assigned area and be monitored by their teacher. Failure to comply with these requests will be treated as
insubordination. Appropriate behavior is expected at all times. Appropriate behaviors include, but are not limited to:

e Demonstrating respect for the speakers or presenters.
e Listening attentively while the performers are addressing the audience.
e Sitting in an appropriate manner, keeping feet off chairs and out of the aisles.

Disruptive students will be removed by administrators or teachers and may receive further disciplinary consequences.

GENERAL POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

Announcements

Announcements will occur specifically at 8:00 AM and again at approximately 2:35 PM. Any class, club, or organization
wanting to have an announcement read must present the announcement, written legibly, and signed by the advisor of
the activity, to the office secretary in order to be approved by the principal for reading. In order to ensure that an
announcement is approved, it is advisable to submit it as early as possible. Unapproved requests will not be read during
the scheduled announcement times.

In addition to the normal daily announcements, classes, clubs, athletics, and organizations frequently request permission
to post announcements in the high school to advertise numerous activities. Permission to post these announcements
throughout the school must be obtained from the office of the principal prior to putting up any items in the high school.

Special announcements concerning cancelations or postponements of athletic events or extra-curricular activities will be
completed through emails.

Arrival to School in the Morning
All students in 5th through 12th grade, arriving by bus, driving, or being dropped off, shall enter the high school through
the three sets of double doors nearest the main office unless being dropped off by a parent.

Parent drop-off for students will be in the rear of the building at the set of doors beyond the band room - door #29. Once
the student has exited the vehicle, parents will need to continue around the back of the building and exit the property on
the elementary playground side.

The doors will be unlocked at 7:35. Once allowed into the building, HS students shall report to the HS cafeteria. MS
students shall report to the library. Students will be released from those locations at 7:43 to report to their homerooms.

If students arrive prior to 7:35 they are to wait outside of the rear door, or they may go to the front main entrance of the
school and wait inside between the double set of doors. The exterior doors will be unlocked but the doors leading into
the school itself will remain locked until 7:35.

Students consistently arriving prior to 7:35 can be dropped off at the front door and wait in the lobby area accordingly.

After 7:35 no students are permitted to be dropped off at the front of the school because it interferes with the buses.

12
Attendance — Senior Privilege

Seniors must obtain prior approval from the high school principal before early dismissal or late arrival privileges can
begin. A student with a job may leave after 5" period providing, they have scheduled all of their graduation
requirements and are on track for graduation. If a student leaves the job for whatever reason, the student has two
weeks to secure another job or return to school.

For senior students without a job, they can obtain approval for early dismissal or late arrival if they have a study hall at
either the beginning of the day or at the end of the day. No students will be dismissed for periods of time in between 1°
and 8" period. All students seeking approval must meet academic and attendance standards. Students who violate
behavior, academic, or attendance expectations and guidelines may have their privilege suspended or revoked
indefinitely.

NOTE: No juniors will be allowed to arrive late or leave early because of work and/or study hall at the beginning or the
end of the day, respectively.

Athletic Events

Good sportsmanship is learned, practiced, and executed. Respect for the opponent, spectators, coaches, and officials are
a must at all levels of athletics. At interscholastic contests, behavior on the part of everyone should be characterized by
generosity and genuine concern for others.

Students who attend any athletic event at West Branch Area HS are not to display any unsportsmanlike conduct toward
officials and/or any opposing players, spectators, or coaches. Doing so will result in an immediate suspension from the
event with possible disciplinary action for future events. This includes inappropriate comments, gestures, profanity or any
behavior of any kind that could be considered disrespectful.

Authority Statement

All students shall comply with directions of the administrators, teachers, substitute teachers, bus drivers, or any other
school official whenever a student is under the authority of the school. All students shall demonstrate proper respect
toward all school officials and must comply with all reasonable directives from such officials.

NOTE: Students having assessments as a result of policy violation must comply by those recommendations at parental
expense or be subject to exclusion from school. A timetable will be set.

Breakfast

West Branch HS offers a grab and go breakfast each regularly scheduled day from 7:50 to 8:00. Students may eat breakfast
in the lunchroom or on the way to class. Please throw all of your trash in the proper containers that are located in the
hallways. Students are permitted to eat during the opening of class (approximately 5-7 minutes).

Bus Notes

West Branch Area SD may provide transportation to/from an alternate location, provided there is room available on the
route and the following guidelines are met:

1. The alternate location is consistent five days per week for morning and afternoon. Alternative locations will remain
the same for at least one semester. Example: Student may be transported from one location to school in the AM and
from school to another location in the PM.

2. The alternate location is along a regularly scheduled route at a regularly scheduled stop.

13
Cafeteria
The cafeteria is for the convenience of every student. In addition to the school discipline code, students are to adhere to
the following:

Please properly dispose of trash. Students may not have food delivered from local
Please keep your table area clean. restaurants.
Please remain in your assigned seating area. Please be respectful of others.

Throwing food, paper, or other items is unacceptable and
will result in disciplinary action.

The goal of cafeteria services is to provide nutritious meals, within USDA-approved guidelines, to promote optimum
student performance in the classroom. Menus are posted in the cafeteria and circulated throughout classrooms and
offices. Menus are also posted on the school’s web page (www.westbranch.org).

At West Branch, students may choose whether or not to participate in lunch meal programs. The cafeteria provides meals
via an offer versus serve system. Under this system, the student may decide not to select any one of the five lunch items
required to be served on the menu. A-la-carte food and drink items are sold in the cafeteria daily. Students must have a
positive balance in order to purchase a-la-carte items.

Teachers and/or monitors are responsible for maintaining an orderly and pleasant atmosphere in the cafeteria. Shouting,
unnecessary moving around, and boisterous behavior which interferes with a climate conducive to good eating habits and
a comfortable environment for all are not permitted.

Meal Prices and Procedures

For the 2023-2024 school year, breakfast and lunch are free for students. The district promotes good nutrition and
wellness by providing breakfast and lunch to students as a part of the Community Eligibility Provision program (CEP) in
compliance with the National School Lunch Program, School Breakfast Program. The CEP program provides a healthy
breakfast and lunch each school day at no charge for all students enrolled during the school year. This program does not
include second meals and a la carte purchases, however, these are available for an additional cost. Meal and a la carte
pricing can be found on the district’s website.

A computerized pre-pay accounting system maintains student accounts and meal data. Students are to bring or parents
may send payments of cash or checks payable to West Branch Cafeteria for deposit into individual student accounts.
Payments should include name, homeroom, and amount enclosed to ensure accuracy. Payment boxes are provided in
the office and cafeteria and must be deposited by 8:00 AM to ensure same day credit. These accounts are debited as
students purchase meals, milk, a-la-carte, etc.

Students are to report to the cafeteria at their designated lunch time. As they pass through the food line, they will select
a tray and be able to add food items. Items selected in addition to the regular menu will be charged by the computer
operator. Each student enters their pin number. The transaction is entered into the computer and the student’s individual
account is debited.

Students are encouraged to bring in payments without excessive reminders. Parents should keep records at home so
payments can be sent in a timely manner. This reduces paperwork and time spent maintaining the system. Individual
student account information is available upon request. We encourage payments to be made in the form of acheck. This
ensures that we can track your child’s payments. Cash payments are not traceable. Large amounts of change must be
rolled. We will not accept large amounts of loose change. A $25.00 fee plus banking charges will be charged for any
returned checks.

14
As a matter of standard practice, refunds for account balances over $2.00 after the end of the school year are processed
for students who withdraw or graduate. The school reserves the right to initiate legal action for unpaid negative account
balances. Students with negative account balances of $5.00 or more will also not be allowed to participate in
extracurricular activities (i.e. clubs, sports) or field trips, and may lose parking or other privileges, until the balance is
paid in full. Referrals and/or other consequences will be given to those in violation of the above.

*Payments may be made in varying amounts, which may fit each household’s financial circumstances. Any questions or
concerns can be addressed by calling 345-5627 and asking to speak with cafeteria staff.

Cell Phones / Electronic Devices

The West Branch Area HS recognizes the usefulness of cellular telephones and other devices as a means of supplementing
educational instruction under staff supervision. Any unauthorized use of electronic devices will result in disciplinary

other type of inappropriate communication conduct may merit the confiscation of a cell phone/device and be used/held
as evidence for an extended period of time pending the alleged misuse of the device and appropriate disciplinary action.

15
Clubs

At West Branch HS, students can be actively involved in many ways. Besides academic work and interscholastic sports
activities, there are a number of organized clubs that students can join. Students will be encouraged and required to
choose a club(s) to attend during monthly activity days. Students will not be required to attend any club related functions
outside of activity day. Parents or guardians can decline permission for their student(s) to belong to any
club(s). Exemption can be completed by the parent or guardian by indicating it in writing to the high school principal.

Dismissal

School is dismissed at 2:40 PM unless otherwise directed. Students who ride the bus should report immediately to the bus
while those who walk, or drive should leave the school as soon as possible. After 2:40 PM, all students should vacate the
premises unless they are under the immediate supervision of a teacher, coach, chaperone, or advisor. Students are not
permitted to congregate on school property without supervision. Those students who remain must sit in the main lobby
until their ride arrives. Any unsupervised student who is in an area other than the main lobby can be subject to disciplinary
actions.

Students being excused during the school day are to exit the building through the main office doors after signing out.

Driving / Parking (see also Arrival to School in the Morning)

All students in 5th through 12th grade, driving or being dropped off, are to enter the high school through the three sets
of double doors nearest the main office.

Please understand that driving on school property is a privilege and safety is vital; therefore, those who do not follow the
driving guidelines listed in this section will immediately lose their driving/parking privileges and/or incur other
consequences. A student can also lose driving/parking privileges for not parking in his/her assigned spot, as well as for
other offenses.

Parking Spaces

Students will be assigned to spaces in the front of the building as much as possible. After being assigned a parking
space, a student is to continue to use that space unless given permission by the administration to do otherwise. If you
arrive to find your parking space taken, please notify the principal. Likewise, please do not park anywhere but your
assigned space during school hours. Students are not to be parking in the church lot.

Access to Vehicles during the Day
Students are not permitted to go out to their vehicle during the school day without the permission of the principal. In
general, students must wait until the end of their school day to go out to their vehicles.

Clearfield County Career and Technology Center
No student may drive to the C.C.C.T.C. without the permission of the principal from West Branch and the C.C.C.T.C.

NOTE:
Off road motor vehicles such as snowmobiles, dirt bikes, ATV’s are prohibited on school property at any time.

Financial Obligations

All student financial obligations must be satisfied before receiving a report card and/or being able to participate in
graduation services at the end of the year. Students must pay the replacement value for lost or damaged books. No
student will be able to participate in graduation services from WBHS who has not met all financial obligations such as
cafeteria debt, payment for library or test books, project costs, or replacement costs of damaged school property.

16
Fundraisers

When a student participates in a fundraiser under any of the Activity Clubs in West Branch HS, the parent will write one
check to the club for payment of all items ordered. The payment can also be made in cash or money order. Receipts will
be given upon request. If a check is returned for insufficient funds, the parent must pay back the amount of the check plus
a $25.00 West Branch fee and a $10.00 bank fee for a total of $35.00. This fee must be paid in the form of cash or a money
order to the West Branch HS before the student’s order will be placed. If a check is returned insufficient, then parent
checks will no longer be able to be used for that student. Any future fundraisers will have to be paid in cash or by money
order. These rules apply only to Activity Clubs within the school; outside booster clubs have their own set of rules
regarding fundraisers.

Hall Lockers

Lockers are assigned for each student. All students must keep books, coats, hats, backpacks, bags, and other belongings
in their own locker. Any student backpack, bag, purse, etc. that is carried into a class must be able to fit under the
desk/chair in that classroom so that it doesn’t block any walkway or present a hazard to others. Athletes, musicians, etc.
with bags or cases too large for the locker or to be carried class to class must be stored in a designated area. For example,
many athletes will take a larger bag to a coach’s room to store for the day. Band students take their instruments to the
band room or place in a designated area as directed by the band director.

The school provides students with hall lockers and locks but assumes no responsibility for the safe-keeping of the contents
of the lockers. Lockers must be kept locked at all times. Valuables should not be left in lockers. If necessary, students
may store valuables in the high school office during the day and pick them up after school. In the event that your locker
or lock is not functioning properly to protect your items, it is your responsibility to inform Mr. Williamson in a timely
manner. He will see that the locker or lock is fixed or that you are assigned a new locker.

Students and parents are reminded that lockers remain the property of the West Branch Area School District. There is no
right to privacy extended to any student concerning his/her locker. The school district and its officials reserve the right to
inspect and search a student's locker at any time and remove any object or material which is illegal, contrary to school
rules, or which may be detrimental to the school or student. Such materials may be used as evidence against the student
in disciplinary, juvenile, or criminal proceedings. Prior to a locker search, the student may be notified and given the
opportunity to be present; however, when such authorities have a reasonable suspicion that a locker contains materials
which pose a threat to the health, welfare, and safety of students/staff/visitors in the school, the locker may be searched
without the student's presence. The school assumes no responsibility for student's belongings stored in a hall locker.

Each student will be provided a combination lock for use on his/her locker. Students are responsible to return their locks
at the end of the school year. Students are responsible for not sharing their combination or locker with others and
ensuring the lock is kept locked. Students losing locks may choose to purchase a second combination lock through the
office at a cost of $5.00. The $5.00 fee will be charged to any student not turning in the assigned lock at the end of the
school year.

Health Office Policies
1) Students are to report to the nurse if they are ill, have an injury, or need to be evaluated for health reasons. Students
may not use a cell phone or school building phones to call their parents to leave for health problems. If students use a
cell phone or building phone to contact their parents without approval from the nurse, the absence will be unexcused.
Students must be evaluated, and dismissed by the nurse if medically necessary to leave school due to illness, injury, or
other health reasons. A parent can choose to take his/her child to the physician to get a doctor’s excuse if the parent
wishes for the absence to be considered an excused absence. However, the student must be evaluated by the physician
the day the student left school and the excuse returned per the student handbook’s absence procedures. To be in
compliance with attendance requirements, if a student has already missed 10 days or more and he/she leaves school due
to illness or injury, a doctor’s excuse is needed for that absence from the school day. The school nurse is not able to
provide the excuse for any student with excessive absences.

17
2) Please do not send your child to school and ask the nurse to diagnose your child’s health problem or previous injury.
The nurse is not a physician, and under the Nurse Practice Act is not allowed to diagnose health conditions. In addition, if
your child had an injury on a previous day, and is unable to participate in gym class; the school nurse cannot excuse the
student from gym class. A doctor’s excuse is required.

3) Delivery and Storage of Medications — Policy 210.

All medication shall be brought to the nurse’s office, or the main office if the nurse is in another building, by the
parent/guardian or by another adult designated by the parent/guardian. All medication shall be stored in the original
pharmacy-labeled container and kept in a locked cabinet designated for storage of medication.

Medications that require refrigeration shall be stored and locked in a refrigerator designated only for medications. The
district shall not store more than a thirty-day supply of an individual student’s medication.

Medication should be recorded and logged in with the date, name of student, name of medication, amount of medication,
and signatures of the parent/guardian or designated adult delivering the medication and the school health personnel
receiving the medication.

Nonprescription medication must be delivered in its original packaging and labeled with the student’s name.
Prescription medication shall be delivered in its original packaging and labeled with:

Name, address, telephone and federal DEA (Drug Enforcement Agency) number of the pharmacy.

Student’s name.

Directions for use (dosage, frequency and time of administration, route, special instructions).

Name and registration number of the licensed prescriber.

4) Each student must have a completed emergency card, updated yearly, on file in the health office. See the Info Snap
section of the handbook. Only persons designated on the emergency card may pick up students from school if the nurse
is unable to reach the student’s parent/guardian. If the student does not turn in an emergency card for the current school
year, and the nurse is unable to reach his/her parent/guardian, the student will not be allowed to leave the school building
with anyone other than the parent/guardian. Parents: If possible, please include at least one other contact person who
is able to drive to pick up the student if needed.

5) Health History Forms will be passed out to students yearly, are available in the health office, and available to download
from the school nurse’s webpage. It is very important to update this form yearly and return it to the nurse so the nurse is
aware of any health problems that may impact your child during the school day. If you choose not to indicate that your
child has any health problems, we ask that you still sign and return the form so that the nurses know that you received it.
If you, the parent/guardian, would like any teacher, bus driver, or any other staff member to be made aware of your child’s
health problems, it is your responsibility to notify them.

The nurse will not routinely share this information except in an emergency situation or if the nurse determines that an
employee has an immediate need to know for the welfare of your child. In addition, if you notify the teacher of your
child’s health condition, and you would also like the nurse to be made aware of the same, it is your responsibility to notify
the nurse.

6) All students must abide by the school health law and have the required health screenings and immunizations completed

for that grade. Dental exams are mandatory for students in grades K, 3, and 7. Physical exams are mandatory for students

in grades K, 6, and 11. For dental and physical exams, parents have the option of either having a school dental/physical
18
exam free of charge, or taking their child to their private dentist/physician at their expense, and returning a copy of the
exam to the school nurse prior to the date of the school screening/exam. Private physical and dental forms are available
in the nurse’s office and available to download from the school nurse’s webpage. Vision, Height, Weight, and Body Mass
Index (BMI) screenings will be done yearly as required by law. Hearing Screenings will be done for students in grades K,
1, 2, 3, 7, and 11 as required by law. Scoliosis screenings will be done for all 7th grade students as required by law.
Students who do not submit required immunization and health screenings paperwork by the deadlines set by the district
will be excluded from school until the paperwork is submitted to the school nurse.

7) Students are not permitted to be in school with lice. If a student is found to have lice during the school day, the parent
will be contacted and the child will be sent home. Students will also be sent home if nits (lice eggs) are found and the
student was not recently treated with a lice shampoo. It is the parent/guardian’s responsibility to properly treat the lice,
and return the student to school the next school day to be checked by the school nurse. If the student does not return
to school the next school day because of lice, the student will only be excused for the day the student was sent home by
the nurse.

8) Please address hygiene issues with your children at home.
Please be aware that children can be sensitive to odors, such as odors from animals that may linger on clothing, chemicals,
perfumes, and personal body odor.

9) Extra clothes — The nurses recommend that all students carry an extra set of clothes in their backpacks or store in
lockers. Many times, extra clothes are needed for reasons such as bowel or bladder accidents, menstrual problems,
muddy/wet clothes, or food spills.

10) Temperature checks — The District reserves the right to conduct temperature checks upon arrival for all employees,
students, and visitors throughout the school year and as warranted by increased illness

Homework / In-Class Work

Students at West Branch HS are to complete all assignments when they are due. Students must assume responsibility to
produce original work, arrange to complete any missed assignments, ask for additional help when needed, and put forth
reasonable effort. In addition, students should bring their laptops to class on a daily basis.

Immunizations

The Pennsylvania Department of Health regulations require that all students attending school must be fully immunized.
All students must comply with the requirements of the State Immunization Code (28 PA Code, Ch 23). Complete
immunization records must be delivered to the school prior to a students’ acceptance for enrollment. The only exceptions
to these regulations are those students for whom immunization is not medically advisable, those for whom immunization
is contrary to religious or moral convictions, and students who qualify for admission to school under the auspices of the
McKinney Vento Act regarding homelessness. Students who are not fully immunized will be prevented from entering
school.

InfoSnap

InfoSnap is an online, cloud-based, student registration system. This system allows parents to fill out student forms via
the Internet. Please locate the InfoSnap link on the district website at http://www.westbranch.org in order to locate the
necessary documents. If you are unable to access InfoSnap from home, the school will be open at specific times through
late summer and early fall for the purpose of assisting families with the process of entering the information. All other
information regarding this program, including tutorials, will be found on the school website. Parents/guardians are
required to provide the district with this information annually using the district system. Letters will be sent indicating the
due date for completion. Failure to complete the work by the due date will result in loss of privileges.

19
Insurance

A student accident insurance program is available to all students. All students participating in interscholastic athletics
programs are required to have student insurance or furnish proof of comparable coverage with another company.
Students participating in other school activities are encouraged to have insurance.

Internet Services

The West Branch Area School District (WBASD) Acceptable Use Policy outlines all of the regulations governing the WBSD
computer network. Students and their parents/guardians must read the WBSD Acceptable Use Policy, as well as the WBSD
Acceptable Use Policy User Agreement.

The WBSD Acceptable Use Policy User Agreement must be completed and signed by both the student and the
parent/guardian and then be returned to school. A computer account for the student will not be created until the
Acceptable Use Policy User Agreement is completed and signed by both parties and returned to school. A copy of the
West Branch Area School District Acceptable Use Policy will be distributed during the first week of school and will be
available online at the school website. In addition, the school district will educate all students about appropriate online
behavior, including interacting with other individuals on social networking websites and in chat rooms and cyberbullying
awareness and response.

Library Services

The high school library has an extensive fiction collection. Among the collection, you can find popular series and recent
literary award winners. Our non-fiction collection includes titles that are high-interest and also books chosen specifically
to address assignments such as research papers. To aid in locating books, there is an online catalog that is available at
school or at home.

West Branch is a member of the AccessPA system, so students have access to the resources of the Power Library, including
AskHere PA. We also subscribe to the Ebscohost database, where one of the favorite items for our students is a readers’
advisory service called Novelist. Students can use it to find suggestions of other books similar to books they have enjoyed,
or perhaps identify the next book in a series. Ebscohost includes a full periodical database as well as Consumer Health,
Auto Repair, History Research Center and others. It is available to students for home use by accessing the Ebscohost link
on the West Branch High School Library website.

Make-up Work
Students will be given the opportunity to make up missed work and tests after any absence. The following guidelines
should be used for make-up work:

1. It is the responsibility of the student, upon returning to school, to contact the teacher for make-up work and to
complete that work.

2. It is the responsibility of each teacher to provide make-up work for absences.

3. A student will be given a reasonable amount of time for make-up work. Generally, a student will be given two

days after a single day’s absence and five days after two or more days absent, unless the student was already aware of
the assignment. Teachers may use their discretion to further extend the amount of time for make-up work.

4. If a student fails to complete a test/assignment that has been rescheduled by a teacher due to an absence, the
grade automatically becomes a zero and the teacher should contact the parents.

5. If a student arrives late to school, he or she is responsible for contacting the teacher that day to take any test
scheduled or submit work due that day.

6. Students may make up all work missed during a suspension from school within the allotted time established
above.

20
Outstanding Obligations to the District

The West Branch Area School District reserves the right to restrict participation in extracurricular activities if students have
any outstanding obligations to the district. Examples would include overdue lunch account balances, overdue library
books, vandalism, fundraising debts, etc. Participation in extracurricular activities and field trips will be restored when all
obligations have been fulfilled.

Permission to Leave Class

A student may receive permission to leave a classroom by obtaining a pass from his/her teacher. It is up to each teacher
to decide whether or not to allow a student to leave his/her class.

1. Locker passes should only be issued in special situations. Students should go to class each day with all necessary
materials and should not leave that class to get or put away classroom materials.

2. Restroom passes will be issued by the classroom teacher. Students are to have a pass in order to go to the restroom.
3. Students are not permitted to leave the building or go to the elementary or middle school without written permission
from the principal.

eHallpass

The West Branch Area Jr/Sr. High and Middle school utilize the eHallpass system. Any time students leave for the
classroom, they must first enter a pass and have it approved. Teachers may also fill out passes when requesting
students for various reasons. Passes must be started and ended when appropriate. Auto passes may be created for
bathroom and water fountain use. However, students must still seek permission before starting their pass. It is the
student’s responsibility for ending an auto pass.

Any excessive hallway activity by a student will be investigated.

Physical Education

Students at West Branch Area HS are required to participate and pass physical education classes as mandated by the
Pennsylvania Department of Education. A change of clothes is required when participating in the physical education
classes and should include appropriate dress for both indoor and outdoor activities. In addition, athletic shoes are
required. Jewelry is not permitted in any physical education class. Students should not bring valuables to the locker room
or to class. The Physical Education staff is not responsible for lost or stolen items. Due to privacy expectations of others,
students are not to use electronic devices in the locker rooms.

When a student is unable to participate in regular physical education classes for a physical or other compelling reason, a
doctor’s excuse will be submitted to the PE teacher. The excuse will give the nature of the injury or illness, length of time
to be excused from regular physical education classes, and a description of the activities in which the student can
participate. We will also accept notes from our athletic trainer. For medical absences longer than two weeks, the school
reserves the right to assign an alternate physical activity. The school nurse will seek clarification in order to define the
best course of action for the student. If an alternative physical activity is not able to be worked out, the student will work
on acomputer health class, or a teacher approved assignment until he/she is able to return to class.

Physical Education Jewelry Policy
Introduction

This Physical Education Jewelry Policy has been established to provide guidelines for students who wish to wear jewelry
during physical education classes. While jewelry is generally allowed, it is essential to ensure the safety and well-being of
all students. Therefore, parents and guardians will be held liable for any potential injuries or damages resulting from the
wearing of jewelry during physical education activities.

21
Policy Guidelines

1. Permission to Wear Jewelry: Students are permitted to wear jewelry during physical education classes. However, it is
encouraged to keep jewelry to a minimum to minimize potential risks.

2. Safety Considerations: Students must consider the potential safety risks associated with wearing jewelry during physical
activities. It is strongly recommended that students remove any jewelry that may pose a risk, such as dangling or sharp-
edged items. Jewelry that may interfere with safe and effective participation in physical education activities should be
taken off.

3. Liability: Parents and guardians of students are solely responsible for any injuries or damages resulting from the wearing
of jewelry during physical education classes. The school and its staff will not be held liable for any accidents or incidents
involving jewelry worn by students.

4. Notification and Consent: Before the start of the school year, parents or guardians will be informed of this policy and
its implications. They must provide written consent acknowledging that they understand the risks associated with wearing
jewelry during physical education activities and that they will assume liability for any potential injuries or damages.

5. Storage of Jewelry: Students are responsible for the safe storage of their jewelry during physical education classes. The
school will not be held liable for lost or stolen jewelry. It is advisable to use lockers or designated storage areas for valuable
items.

6. Regular Monitoring: The physical education instructor will regularly remind students about the policy and the
importance of adhering to safety guidelines regarding jewelry. They will also have the authority to address any safety
concerns during physical education activities.

This Physical Education Jewelry Policy aims to strike a balance between allowing students the freedom to wear jewelry
while participating in physical education classes and ensuring the safety and well-being of all students. By providing clear
guidelines and involving parents and guardians in the decision-making process, we aim to create a safe and inclusive
learning environment for all students. It is essential for parents and guardians to understand the risks involved and accept
liability for their child's choice to wear jewelry during physical education activities.

Physical Education Dress Code

The following dress code is established to ensure the safety, comfort, and optimal participation of all students in physical
education classes. Please adhere to these guidelines when selecting your attire for physical education sessions:

General Guidelines:

1. Athletic Attire: Students are required to wear appropriate athletic attire suitable for physical activities. This includes
sportswear that allows for ease of movement and breathability.

22
2. Footwear: Athletic shoes (Sneakers) with non-marking soles and proper support are mandatory. Sandals, flip-flops,
crocs, and open-toed shoes are not allowed for safety reasons.

3. Weather Considerations: Dress according to the weather conditions. In colder weather, students may wear additional
layers, such as sweatshirts or long-sleeved athletic shirts.

4. Medical Conditions: If a student has a medical condition that requires specific attire or accommodations, they should
provide a doctor's note outlining the necessary modifications.

This dress code is implemented to promote a safe and inclusive environment in physical education classes, allowing all
students to engage comfortably and participate fully. It is essential to follow these guidelines to ensure the well-being and
safety of everyone involved in physical activities. If you have specific concerns or require accommodations, please contact
your physical education instructor in advance.

Privileges

There are many privileges available to students during their time in high school. Students in good academic and
disciplinary status can participate in clubs, sports, school dances, field trips, pep rallies, and be able to obtain on-site
parking passes. Any one of these privileges or others not listed may be revoked by the school administration, coach, or
advisor if a student’s academic, social behavior, and/or school attendance warrants such an action. In some instances,
students can regain privileges through consistent demonstration of improved conduct and performance.

Safe2Say

Safe2Say Something is a youth violence prevention program run by the PA Office of the Attorney General. The program
teaches youth and adults how to recognize warning signs and signals, especially within social media, from individuals who
may be a threat to themselves or others and to say something before it is too late. With Safe2Say Something, it is easy
and confidential to report safety concerns to help prevent violence and tragedies.

Submit an anonymous tip report through the Safe2Something system via the phone application (Safe2Say Something PA)

other students, school employees, school facilities, the community, or others.”

Telephone Usage

Students needing to use the phone for emergencies may get a pass from their study hall teacher to the office. The Principal
will determine if it is an emergency (forgetting homework is not an emergency).

If either party allows the student to use the phone, the student will complete a log. The student must fill out the log
before the phone call is placed. Students are not permitted to call home to have their parents come and pick them up.
Students who are not excused by the nurse or the office will be considered to be absent unexcused.

carefully. Textbooks must be covered if required by the classroom teacher. Any student losing or damaging a textbook
will be required to reimburse the school district the amount of the replacement cost. Textbooks should be kept in a locked
locker when not being used to avoid loss or theft.

Video Surveillance

To ensure the safety of all students and visitors, the high school building is equipped with video cameras and recording
devices. All students and visitors who enter the high school building acknowledge that they are subject to video
surveillance upon entering the building. These recordings may be used as evidence against the student/visitor in
disciplinary, juvenile, or criminal proceedings.

NOTE: According to Board Policy 810.2, the West Branch Area School Board authorizes the use of video and audio
recording on school buses and school vehicles. The West Branch Area School Board prohibits the use of audio recording

all subjects for which credit is averaged. Any two or more students whose computed grade point average is identical shall
be given the same rank. A student’s grade point average and rank in class shall be entered in his/her record and
transcripts.

Honor Roll

High Honors
In order to receive High Honors a student must:
1. carry at least seven (7) credits
2. average 95% for all classes
3. have no grade lower than 90%
Honors
In order to receive Honors a student must:
1. carry at least 6.5 credits
2. average 90% for all classes
3. have no grade lower than 85%
All grades will be used in computing honor roll. Points will be assigned based on the credit value of the course.

Adding / Dropping Classes

Adding a class: All classes must be added to the student’s schedule within the first 3 days of school for full year classes
and first semester classes. Students must add second semester classes within 3 days of the start of the second semester.
No classes will be added after these deadlines.

Dropping a class: Routine dropping of a class must be within the first 3 days of school for full year classes and first semester
classes. Students must drop a second semester class within 3 days of the start of the second semester.

If a student wishes to drop a class after the 3 days and before the 20" day of the first nine weeks, the student must see
his/her guidance counselor to schedule a meeting with his/her parent, the teacher, and the principal. After the 20 day
of school, students will still need to schedule a meeting but they will also be given a failing grade for the class if they drop.
This same procedure applies to classes that start the second semester with the 20th day beginning at the start of the
semester.

Students must carry a minimum of 7 credits per school year and will be unable to drop a class if they fall below 7 credits.

The administration reserves the right to change a student’s schedule when extenuating circumstances exist.

valid excuse may exclude a student from an extracurricular activity as per the rules governing that team or group. For
students to be eligible to participate in a Saturday contest/performance/school event, attendance in school on Friday is
required.

Academic Issues

Students must meet basic academic requirements to participate in extracurricular activities. Athletes must meet the
requirements outlined in the athletic handbook. Students involved in clubs, activities, etc. must have teachers sign a grade

Procedures and Expectations for Students on Overnight Trips

The West Branch Area School Board is supportive of our student groups when requesting overnight trips. These trips many
times allow for greater competition and the opportunity for our students to learn and/or improve their skills. We also
understand that there are many more risks for our students’ safety. To help keep our students safe the following
procedures and expectations will be in effect.

1. Rules: All school rules apply during overnight trips. School rule violations preceding the trip may result in the
denial of attending the trip. Coaches/advisors will review these rules with students before the trip departs.
Students are reminded that they must respect each other and that there must be no bullying, harassment,
hazing, fighting, or other misconduct. Students should report any misconduct immediately to a coach/advisor.
The staff will be even more vigilant about enforcing school rules on the trip and students will face serious
disciplinary action for any misconduct. Students are expected to remain in their rooms at the direction of their
coach/advisor and/or chaperone at all times. Violations will result in administrative review. Following the
review, disciplinary action up to and including removal from the team/student group will be administered.
Violations relating to drugs, alcohol, and/or weapons will result in an immediate call to the appropriate
authorities.

2. Supervision: The coaches/advisors and their assistants/chaperones must supervise students whenever possible
during the trip, including in the middle of the night. Students are expected to adhere to all directives given by
coaches/advisors and/or chaperones.

3. Searches: Searches of students’ personal property, purses, briefcases, backpacks, and bags will be conducted if
there is reasonable suspicion that a student is violating school rules or the law. These searches may occur at any
time; before, during, and/or after the trip. Coaches/advisors and/or chaperones will be in contact with
administration during the search process.

4. Release of Student: If a student has violated the law, such as by possessing drugs, alcohol, or a weapon, in

addition to calling the authorities, parents may be requested to retrieve their child from the trip. In the event of
parent/guardian refusal to retrieve their child from the trip, any associated costs to return the student will be

the responsibility of the parent/guardian.

ATTENDANCE
GENERAL ATTENDANCE POLICY INFORMATION
Upon the student’s return to school after an absence, a written excuse must be brought from home explaining the reason
for your absence. Excuses for absence should be taken to the attendance window during homeroom. The student must
submit an acceptable excuse within three (3) days of their return to school. If the student does not submit an acceptable
excuse within three (3) days of his/her return to school, the day(s) will result in an illegal absence if the student is 16 years

32
of age or younger or an unexcused absence if the student is 17 years of age or older. THE DAY(S) WILL NOT BE CHANGED
IF AN EXCUSE IS BROUGHT IN AFTER THE THREE (3) DAY PERIOD.

Students who are eighteen or older, who live at home and are enrolled in school, remain the responsibility of their
parents/guardians until graduation. All excuses, dismissals, and permission slips must be signed by their
parents/guardians.

Attendance Accounting Procedures

Early Dismissal

Early dismissal will be granted under certain conditions for medical appointments. When requesting an early dismissal, a
written request must be presented to the office at least one (1) day in advance of the requested day. If a request is not
presented at least one (1) day in advance the parent/guardian will be required to come to the school and sign the student
out. Parents must report to the office before picking up a student. Students are responsible for all work missed due to
an early dismissal.

At the scheduled early dismissal time, the student must report to the main office. Students must exit the building at the
front entrance by the main office. The school asks that parents pick up the student at this entrance only.

All students, regardless of age or where they have chosen to park their vehicle, must adhere to this policy unless there is
a compelling reason for a modification as determined by the principal or his designee.

Students who are dismissed prior to the completion of 4" period will be marked a full day absent if they do not return to
school. If the student returns to school and is present in the building for at least 3 % total hours, the student will only be
marked as % day absent. Students who leave after 4" period will be marked a % day absent.

NOTE: A student must have a valid reason to be excused early from school. If a student does not have a valid reason for
dismissal, the absence will be counted as an unexcused absence. If a student has an early dismissal for a doctor
33
appointment, the student must provide a physician’s note within three (3) days of their return to school for the excuse to
be counted as an excused absence. If a doctor’s note is not received within three (3) days, the absence will be considered
unexcused/illegal.

Examples of unexcused/unlawful absences include:
Shopping trips, babysitting, fishing/hunting, missing the bus/ oversleeping, haircuts, employment, senior pictures,
educational trips/vacations (not approved in advance), and leaving the building without signing out in the office.

Attendance Violations

Attendance violations include late to class, late to school, unexcused class absences (including class cuts and leaving school
grounds without permission). Class cutting and leaving school grounds without permission are clear cut violations and will
be dealt with by administration.

Unexcused Tardies to School
Any class periods missed will be treated as class absences and will count towards the 15/24 Day Rule.

Students will have three (3) days to bring in an excuse for being tardy to school. If a valid excuse is not submitted within
three days, the tardy will be marked unexcused/illegal. The day the student is tardy is counted as day 1 of the 3.

Excused Tardies to School (with legal excuse)
Students will be warned for infractions 1-4 if they present a legal excuse. After the fourth, a doctor’s note will be required;
otherwise, they will be counted as unexcused.

NOTE: Students who arrive late, but do not sign in at the main office and get a late slip, will be charged with an
illegal/unexcused absence.

Tardy to Class
A student is considered tardy for a class if he/she is less than five (5) minutes late for that class. Tardies are cumulative.
Being late for any class period adds to the cumulative total.

If the student is more than five (5) minutes tardy for class, the tardy will be considered an unexcused absence from class
(class cut).

Procedure for Truancy — Illegal / Unexcused Absences
Students 16 years and under who are absent from school without a legal excuse are considered truant, while the students
17 years and older committing the same act are considered unexcused.

Students 16 years and under action taken:
1 NOTICE LETTER: 3 days of illegal absences — certified letter sent home indicating the accumulation of three
(3) illegal days

Parent meeting held
Truancy Elimination Plan created

2" NOTICE LETTER: If the child is illegally absent after the date of the parent meeting (whether the parent attends
or not) legal action may follow. Each succeeding day of illegal absence becomes another second offense.

34
Students 17 years and older action taken:
3™ unexcused absence — Principal’s meeting parents/student

5" unexcused absence — ISS

7* unexcused absence — ISS

10" unexcused absence — School Attendance Contract

STUDENT SERVICES

Guidance Programs and Services

The guidance counselors will assist you in meeting the Pennsylvania state and West Branch Area School District
requirements for graduation. Your counselor will meet with you each year to plan your educational and career goals. Your

Programs for Eligible or Protected Handicapped Students

In compliance with the state and federal law, notice is hereby given by the West Branch Area School District that it
conducts ongoing identification activities as a parts of its school program for the purpose of identifying students who may
be in need of special education and related services. If your child is identified by the District as possibly in need of such
services, you will be notified of applicable procedures. Individualized services and programs are available for children who
are determined to need specially designed instruction due to the following conditions:

Autism/pervasive development disorder
Blindness or visual impairment
Deafness or hearing impairment
Developmental delay
Mentally gifted
Intellectually disabled
Multi-handicapped
Neurological impairment
Other health impairments

e Physical disability

e Serious emotional disturbance

e Specific learning disability

e Speech and language impairment

OANAUPWNP

If you believe that your school-age child may be in need of special education services and related programs, or your child
(age 3 to school-age) may be in need of early intervention, screening, and evaluation processes designed to assess the
needs of the child and his/her eligibility are available to you at no cost, upon written request. You may request screening
and evaluation at any time, whether or not your child is enrolled in the District’s public-school program. Requests for
evaluation and screening are to be made in writing to the principal or special education supervisor.

In compliance with state and federal law, the West Branch Area School District will provide to each protected handicapped
student without discrimination or cost to the student or family, those related aids, services or accommodations which are
needed to provide equal opportunity to participate in and obtain the benefits of the school program and extracurricular
activities to the maximum intent appropriate to the student’s abilities. In order to qualify as a protected handicapped

38
student, the child must be school age with a physical or mental disability that substantially limits or prohibits participation
in or access to an aspect of the school program. These services and protections for “protected handicapped student” are
distinct from those applicable to all eligible or exceptional students enrolled (or seeking enrollment) in special education
programs.

For further information on the rights of parents and children, provision of services, evaluation and screening (including
purpose time and location), and rights to due process procedures, you may contact the special education supervisor.

Student Assistance Program (SAP)

The Student Assistance Program is a team of professionals working together to provide help for adolescents who are
experiencing problems. Alcohol and other drug abuse, disruptions at home, depression, pressure from peers, trouble at
work, loss of a loved one, or many other factors can lead a student to feel alone and hopeless. The cause may differ, but
the result is usually the same - the student’s problems interfere with educational process - a student who is troubled
struggles to learn.

SAP Team:

It is the parent's right to be involved in the process and to have full access to all school records under the applicable state
and federal laws and regulations. Involvement of parents in all phases of the student assistance program underscores the
parent's role and responsibility in the decision-making process affecting their child's education and is key to the successful
resolution of problems.

A student can be referred to the program by parents, teachers, and/or friends. This can be accomplished by contacting
any SAP team member. From there, a referral is made for an interview with the student and parents, if necessary, to gain
information about the students and the nature of the problem. The information gathered is confidential. The evaluation
service is at no cost to the family or student. We are here to help!

STUDENT RECORDS

Disclosure

School districts are permitted to disclose student records to state or local officials within the juvenile justice system.
School districts may also release records concerning disciplinary action taken against a student for conduct that posed a
significant risk to the safety or well-being of that student or to other members of the school community without prior
consent. However, such disclosures should be limited only to those teachers or school officials who have a “legitimate
educational interest in the behavior of that student.”

Review

Students (18 years of age) and parents/guardians of students under age 18 have a right to inspect and review a student’s
educational records by contacting the Guidance Office and scheduling a time for the review.

If the student and/or parent find inaccurate or misleading information he/she should request, in writing, that the Principal
review the inaccurate or misleading information and consider altering the same. No personal information will be disclosed
without prior approval except as stated in the previous section “Disclosure”.

Complaints regarding compliance with the Federal Educational Rights and Privacy Act may be filed with the U.S.
Department of Education.

STUDENT CONDUCT

It is the belief of the West Branch School Board, Administration, Faculty, and Staff that our school will maintain an
environment that will allow continuous and uninterrupted learning.

39
The school policies relating to discipline are reasonable and intended to benefit the safety of our school. Every student
has the right to an education and no student has the right to take this opportunity away. Every student has been able to
review a Student/Parent Discipline Handbook, which explains each discipline policy. Discipline sanctions will be addressed
in the following ways: Detention, In-School Suspension, Out-of-School Suspension, Friday School, and/or Alternative
Education Program. Refer to the Discipline Sanction Chart.

School Rules

The School Board has the authority to make reasonable and necessary rules governing the conduct of students in school.
The rule making power however is not unlimited; it must operate within statutory and constitutional restraints.

1. A School Board has only those powers enumerated in the laws of the State, which may reasonably be implied or
necessary for the orderly operation of the school.

2. School Boards may not make rules which are arbitrary, capricious, or outside their authority granted by the General
Assembly. Rules must stand the test of fairness and reasonableness. A rule is generally considered reasonable if it
uses a rational means of accomplishing some legitimate school purpose.

3. School rules are assumed to be reasonable until they are rescinded or waived. Students, therefore, should obey
school rules even while working through appropriate channels to change those rules that seem unfair.

4. All rules and regulations also apply when students are participating in any extracurricular activity.

5. The Administration shall have the right to formulate other rules, regulations, and disciplinary actions that it deems
necessary to conduct a well-disciplined, safe and orderly school.

6. Inthe event of a violation of great severity or a violation which includes physical assault, fighting, intimidation,
and/or serious threats, steps preceding suspension or expulsion may be bypassed.

Detention

Detention will typically be held from 2:45 — 3:45 PM, Monday through Friday as needed. Students are expected to serve
detention on the assigned day. Students may change the day of a detention one (1) time with written or verbal notification
from a parent/guardian. An additional day of detention will be assigned for failure to attend on the scheduled day or
failure to bring work materials with them. If a second skipped detention occurs, the student will receive two (2) additional
hours. A third skipped detention will result in loss of all extracurricular activities and hall pass privileges until all detention
hours have been served. Hours not served by the end of the school year will be carried over to the following school
year. The student will be on the Loss of Privilege List (loss of extracurricular activities, hall passes, etc.) until all hours
have been made up and served (after the start of the new school year).

Friday School

Friday School will be held from 2:45 — 5:45 PM on assigned Fridays. ALL STUDENTS MUST ARRIVE PROMPTLY AFTER SCHOOL TO THE
ASSIGNED ROOM AND HAVE TRANSPORTATION HOME AT 5:45 PM. Students must bring school work to do.

Failure to bring school work or to work on school work will result in an additional assignment to Friday School, as well as
Out of School Suspension. Failure to attend Friday School will result in an additional day assigned, as well as Out of School
Suspension. Failure to report a 2™ time will result in Out-of-School Suspension, a mandatory parent meeting, and a

Students who have ISS must report to the designated ISS room at the beginning of first period. Students must have all
necessary materials (books, etc.) when they arrive at the ISS room. Students must work on their assignments and are not
permitted to talk. A formal list of rules is posted in the ISS room and must be followed at all times. Students are to submit

school authorities may search a student, student’s locker and desk and may seize any illegal, unauthorized or contraband
materials discovered in the search. Student desks and lockers are school property and may be searched at any time by
authorized school officials. Periodic inspections of lockers and desks may be conducted at any time by school personnel
without notice.

Students’ personal effects (book bag, purse, athletic bag, etc.), as well as a motor vehicle parked on school property, may
be searched if there is a reasonable suspicion to believe that illegal or unauthorized materials may be found, or that the
student is violating law, school board policy or school rules, or poses a threat to the student or the school population.
Searches conducted by the administration may include, but not be limited to, utilization of certified drug dogs or any
device used to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the student and the school population. A student’s failure to
permit searches and seizures could result in a 5-day suspension and possible police contact.

Bullying / Cyberbullying

Policy 249 — adopted October 24, 2011

The West Branch Area School District Board of School Directors is committed to providing all students with a safe, healthy,
and civil school environment in which all members of the school community are treated with mutual respect, tolerance,
and dignity. To that end, the school district has in place policies, and practices that are designed to reduce and eliminate
bullying and harassment when they occur.

This policy is in effect while students are on property within jurisdiction of the school district; while on school-contracted
or school-operated vehicles; and while attending or engaged in school-sponsored activities. Students who file a bullying
complaint or who have assisted or participated in any manner in a bullying investigation may not be retaliated against.
Any violation of this policy shall be considered an infraction of the Code of Conduct, with discipline implemented
accordingly. All bullying behavior that is a violation of the PA Crimes Code will be reported to the appropriate legal
authorities.

The Board encourages students who have been bullied to promptly report such incidents to the building principal or
designee.

41
Bullying shall mean an intentional electronic, written, verbal or physical act, or series of acts:
1. Directed at another student or students.

2. Which occurs in a school setting.

3. That is severe, persistent or pervasive.

4. That has the effect of doing any of the following:

a Substantially interfering with a student’s education.

b. Creating a threatening environment.

c Substantially disrupting the orderly operation of the school.

School setting shall mean in the school, on school grounds, in school vehicles, at a designated bus stop, or at any activity
sponsored, supervised, or sanctioned by the school.

Bullying, as defined in this policy, includes cyberbullying.

The Superintendent or designee shall develop administrative regulations to implement this policy.

This policy shall be implemented through the cooperative efforts of the Superintendent, building administrators, school
staff members, parents/guardians, regional police and state police, and the school district’s community.

Each staff member shall be responsible for maintaining an educational environment free from bullying. Staff members
who observe or become aware of an act of bullying shall take immediate, appropriate steps to intervene unless the
intervention would be a threat to staff members’ safety. In that case, or if the bullying persists, s/he shall report the
bullying to the school principal for further investigation. This investigation may include interviews with students,
parents/guardians, and school staff; review of school records; and any other appropriate means of investigation.

The Board expects that students and parents/guardians who become aware of an act of bullying shall report it to a school
official (usually the building principal) for further investigation. Any student who retaliates against another person for
reporting bullying, intimidation and/or physical assault shall be subject to further disciplinary action.

Students shall be informed about the policy on the district’s publicly accessible Internet web site, and in every classroom.
The policy shall be posted at a prominent location within each school building where such notices are usually posted. Each
school building principal shall ensure that the policy and procedures for reporting bullying incidents are reviewed with
students at least once each school year.

The Superintendent or designee, in cooperation with other appropriate administrators, shall review this policy every three
(3) years and recommend necessary revisions to the Board.

District administration shall annually provide the following information with the Safe School Report:

1. Board’s Bullying Policy.

2. Report of bullying incidents.

3. Information on the development and implementation of any bullying prevention, intervention or
education programs.

4. The Code of Student Conduct, which shall contain this policy, shall be disseminated annually to students.

This policy shall be accessible in every classroom. The policy shall be posted in a prominent location within each school
building and on the district web site, if available.

Preventive Measures

A copy of this policy will be included in the student handbooks annually. Teachers, counselors, specialists, and school
administrators will routinely discuss bullying with students and will provide appropriate examples to assist students with
recognizing, identifying, and reporting bullying incidents. All students shall be informed that bullying will not be tolerated
in any form. All students shall be encouraged to report any bullying regardless of whether they are the victim or an
observer.

When an investigation substantiates that bullying has occurred, the building principal or assistant principal shall inform
staff who work with the offending student and the victim about the bullying so that those staff can more closely monitor
for future incidents of bullying. The primary purpose of such action is to protect the victim and deter such behavior in the

42

future. The disciplinary action imposed on the offender will match the severity of the offense.

Reporting Procedures

All students who believe they have been the victim of bullying shall promptly report the bullying incident to a teacher,
counselor, or building administrator.

All parents/guardians are encouraged to report the bullying incident(s) to a building administrator.

Any teacher/counselor who witnesses bullying or receives a report of bullying shall document such incident and promptly
investigate the matter. After the investigation has been completed, the building principal shall take appropriate actions
consistent with this policy.

Disciplinary and Other Actions

A student who violates this policy shall be subject to appropriate disciplinary action consistent with the Code of Student
Conduct, which may include:

Counseling within the school.

Parental conference.

Loss of school privileges.

Exclusion from school-sponsored activities.

Detention.

Suspension.

Expulsion.

Board Hearing

Referral to law enforcement officials.

OANAUPWNP

If an investigation substantiates that bullying has occurred, a written record of the incident shall be placed in the file of
the offending students(s). Parents/Guardians of the offending students will be encouraged to attend one (1) or more
conferences with an administrator to review the bullying behavior and cooperative strategies for correcting it. The building
principal or designee shall also inform the victim’s parents/guardians of any and all bullying incidents involving their child.
Disciplinary action shall be in accordance with the Board approved Code of Student Conduct depending on the severity of
the offense. If the investigation has determined that the conduct rises to the level of a crime, disciplinary action may also
include referral to law enforcement officials.

All incidents of confirmed bullying, shall be recorded in writing and placed in the offending student’s discipline file.
The penalties and prohibitions in this policy are in addition to, and do not replace or supersede, any related provisions in
district policy prohibiting conduct such as harassment, violence, assault, and hazing.

Controlled Substances / Paraphernalia

Policy 227 — adopted October 24, 2011

school.

4. The conduct has a direct nexus to attendance at school or a school-sponsored activity, such as an agreement to complete
a transaction outside of school that would violate the Code of Student Conduct.

5. The conduct involves the theft or vandalism of school property.

The Superintendent or designee shall develop administrative regulations to identify and control substance abuse in the
schools which:

1. Establish procedures to deal with students suspected of using, possessing, being under the influence, or distributing
controlled substances in school, up to and including expulsion and referral for prosecution.

weapons in the school setting is a threat to the safety of students and staff and is prohibited by law.

Definitions

Weapon - the term shall include but not be limited to any knife, cutting instrument, cutting tool, nunchaku, firearm,
shotgun, rifle, replica of a weapon, and any other tool, instrument or implement capable of inflicting serious bodily

injury.[1][2]

Possession - a student is in possession of a weapon when the weapon is found on the person of the student; in the
student's locker; and under the student's control while on school property, on property being used by the school, at any
school function or activity, at any school event held away from the school, or while the student is coming to or from school.

Authority

The Board prohibits students from possessing and bringing weapons and replicas of weapons into any school district
buildings, onto school property, to any school-sponsored activity, and onto any public vehicle providing transportation to
school or a school-sponsored activity or while the student is coming to or from school.[2][3]

The Board shall expel for a period of not less than one (1) year any student who violates this weapons policy. Such
expulsion shall be given in conformance with formal due process proceedings required by law and Board policy. The
Superintendent may recommend modifications of such expulsion requirement on a case-by-case basis.[2][4]

In the case of a student with a disability, including a student for whom an evaluation is pending, the district shall take all
steps required to comply with state and federal laws and regulations, the procedures set forth in the memorandum of

understanding with local law enforcement and Board policies.[2][5][6][7][8][9]

Delegation of Responsibility

The Superintendent or designee shall react promptly to information and knowledge concerning possession of a weapon.
Such action shall be in compliance with state law and regulations and with the procedures set forth in the memorandum
of understanding with local law enforcement officials and the district’s emergency preparedness plan.[11][12]

Guidelines

The Superintendent or designee shall immediately report incidents involving weapons on school property, at any school-
sponsored activity or on a conveyance providing transportation to or from a school or school-sponsored activity to the
local police department that has jurisdiction over the school’s property, in accordance with state law and regulations, the
procedures set forth in the memorandum of understanding with local law enforcement and Board
policies.[11][13][2][14][15]

52
The Superintendent or designee shall notify the parent/guardian of any student directly involved in an incident involving
weapons as a victim or suspect immediately, as soon as practicable. The Superintendent or designee shall inform the
parent/guardian whether or not the local police department that has jurisdiction over the school property has been or
may be notified of the incident. The Superintendent or designee shall document attempts made to reach the
parent/guardian.[14][16]

In accordance with state law, the Superintendent shall annually, by July 31, report all incidents involving possession of a
weapon to the Office for Safe Schools on the required form.[13]

The building principal shall annually inform staff, students and parents/guardians about the Board policy prohibiting
weapons and about their personal responsibility for the health, safety and welfare of the school community.

An exception to this policy may be made by the Superintendent, who shall prescribe special conditions or administrative
regulations to be followed.[2]

In accordance with federal law, possession or discharge of a firearm in, on, or within 1,000 feet of school grounds is
prohibited. Violations shall be reported to the appropriate law enforcement agency.[17][18]

Transfer Students

When the school district receives a student who transfers from a public or private school during an expulsion period for
an offense involving a weapon, the district may assign that student to an alternative assignment or may provide alternative
education, provided the assignment does not exceed the expulsion period.[2]

High School Dance Policy

General Information

1. For all informal dances, students in grades nine through twelve are permitted to attend. NO middle school or
elementary students will be allowed to attend high school dances under any circumstances. Some formal/semi-formal
dances have specific age/grade requirements; for example, to attend the West Branch Jr./Sr. Prom, a student or guest
must be in Grade 9 through 20 years of age. No attendee can be 21 years of age or older. Only students who meet these
requirements are permitted to attend the dance. This information will be given to the students at the time they sign up
for the dance. No guests over the age of twenty will be permitted to any school dance.

2. Some formal/semi-formal dances have specific dress code requirements. This information will be given to the students
at the time they sign up for the dance. Students who do not follow these requirements will not be permitted entrance to
the dance.

3. A West Branch student may sign in ONE guest for a dance and meet all deadlines for registering. The student will need
to fill out the Guest Permit Form. Guests must be able to show proof of age upon request and follow our grade level
requirements. Students are to show their ID cards to any chaperone(s) who request(s) to see them.

4. Upon entering the dance, all students are to proceed immediately to the "money" table in order to enter the dance.
There is to be no loitering in the lobby. Students are either attending the dance, or they are to leave school property.

5. Students are to conduct themselves according to all school policies, rules, and guidelines.

6. Students will be removed from the dance for any infraction for which the advisor(s) in charge deem(s) necessary.
Students removed from the dance will immediately call for transportation home, will sit on a bench in the front hall with
a chaperone or security guard, and will sign out when leaving. Depending on the severity of the infraction, the student’s
parents/guardians will be contacted by the advisors.

53
7. Astudent in grade nine must stay at the dance until it is over, or until his/her parent/guardian notifies the head
chaperone(s) that the student is leaving.

8. All students leaving before the dance is over will sign out, and must leave school property immediately.

9. Drinking and eating are permitted in the cafeteria during a dance. Students are expected to be responsible for any
garbage they generate. Trash cans are always available.

10. The advisor(s) will determine the appropriateness of dance styles and reserve(s) the right, at any time, to stop the
music and/or end the dance itself. "Moshing," slamming into one another, will not be tolerated!

If students have any questions about rules/policies for dances, they should contact the advisor and/or the principal.

Disciplinary Levels

Level 1: Students who have been documented as displaying guidance and SAP concerns. Level 1 behavior will not receive
consequences for these behaviors. The guidance concerns are logged so that students’ teachers and guidance counselors
may track changes in student behavior that could be related to mental health issues or significant changes in students’
environment that could have an effect on educational success.

Examples of Level 1 Behaviors:

e =lsolated from Peers e Sudden Change in Grades/Performance
e Hygiene Concerns e Deteriorating Appearance
e Emotional/Crying in Class e Not Dressing for PE Class

Level 2 (Minors): The student exhibits misbehavior that impedes orderly classroom procedures or interferes with the
orderly operation of the school. Many of these acts of misbehavior will be handled by the faculty or staff member who
observes the infraction, while repeated offenses may require administrative or guidance office support.

the learning of others. Many of these infractions will be the continuation of Level 2 misbehaviors because consequences
at that level have failed to correct the problem.

Examples of Level 3 Behaviors:

e Harassment — Verbal or Physical e Repeated Documented Minors
e Bus Violation e Skipping Class
e Bullying e Minor Altercation

54
Level 4 (Major/Office Level): When a student demonstrates a Level 4 behavioral concern, the behavior should

e Verbal reprimand e Temporary or complete removal from class

e Withdrawal of Privileges e Referral to appropriate law enforcement agencies
e Written warning e Charges under the criminal code

Homeless Liaison Letter

Attention Parents and Guardians

Federal guidelines, as set forth in No Child Left Behind Act of 2001, require that local school identify name
children who are homeless. The federal mandate, and the intention of West Branch S/D is to ensure that
homeless children and youth have access to free appropriate public education on an equal basis with other
children. Children who are homeless, including those living with others, may qualify for assistance with school
lunch, with school supplies/materials, with tutoring, and with transportation so that they can remain in their
school of origin.

If you believe your child(ren) may qualify for this service, please contact the principal of your child(ren)’s school.
You may also contact Dave Williamson at (814) 345-5615 extension 1006.

Homeless children may be identified as living in the following situations:

e Public or private shelters;

e Public or private places not designated for/or ordinarily used as regular sleeping accommodations
such as vehicles, parks, motels, campgrounds, etc.;

e Living with a parent(s) in a domestic violence shelter;

e = Individuals and/or families living with relatives or friends due to a lack of housing;

e Living in transitional housing programs;

e Runaway children (under age 18) and children who have been abandoned or forced out of the home
by parents or other caretakers. They may be in temporary shelters awaiting assistance from social
service agencies, or may live alone on the street or move from place to place among family members,
friends or acquaintances. This also includes such youth from 18 to 21 of age who may still be eligible
for educational services in regular or special education;

e = Children of migrant families who lack adequate housing;

e Children abandoned in hospitals or awaiting foster care; or

e School-age, unwed mothers or expectant mothers living in houses for unwed mothers when they
have no other available living accommodations.

If your living situation changes during the school year or over the summer, and you and your child(ren) become
homeless, please be sure to contact the schools. We will work with you so that your child(ren)’s education is
disrupted as little as possible.

Sincerely,

Dave Williamson
